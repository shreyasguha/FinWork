Thereafter, as the negative impact of high commodity prices wanes and a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing, albeit more slowly, at a pace above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to increase temporarily to around 2 percent -- due to the impact of a significant rise in energy prices -- in fiscal 2022, when the effects of a reduction in mobile phone charges dissipate. Thereafter, however, the rate of increase is expected to decelerate because the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane. Meanwhile, in terms of inflation excluding energy, for which prices fluctuate significantly, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is expected to moderately increase in positive territory on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage inflation, and partly also of a pass-through of raw material cost increases to food in particular. \uf06c Comparing the projections through fiscal 2023 with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected growth rates for fiscal 2021 and 2022 are lower due to the effects of such factors as a resurgence of COVID-19, the rise in commodity prices, and a slowdown in overseas economies. However, the projected growth rate for fiscal 2023 is higher, partly owing to a rebound from the lower projection in the previous year. The projected rate of increase in the CPI for fiscal 2022 is significantly higher, mainly reflecting the impact of the rise in energy prices. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19, including variants, and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In addition, there are extremely high uncertainties over developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in commodity prices, global financial and capital markets, and overseas economies. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 and the situation surrounding Ukraine, but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for the time being, mainly reflecting uncertainties over energy prices, but are generally balanced thereafter. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on April 27 and 28, 2022. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although some weakness has been seen in economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase as a trend, despite the remaining effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have improved on the whole, but business sentiment has seen a pause in its improvement Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained relatively weak on the whole, although improvement has been seen in some parts. Private consumption has started picking up again, with downward pressure stemming from COVID-19, particularly on services consumption, waning. Housing investment has been more or less flat. Public investment has been relatively weak, albeit at a high level. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food), despite being affected by the reduction in mobile phone charges, has been in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent, reflecting price rises in energy and other items. Meanwhile, inflation expectations, particularly short-term ones, have risen. From the beginning to the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning and with the government's economic measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from the rise in commodity prices. as wheat, have seen a significant rise recently, mainly reflecting heightened supply concerns as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since Japan relies on imports for most of these commodities, rises in these prices bring about an outflow of income from Japan (i.e., trading losses), and put downward pressure on households' real income and corporate profits through rises in energy and food prices. That said, the government's measures against oil price hikes and the accumulation of household savings that has resulted from pandemic-related restrictions are expected to mitigate downward pressure on income and the consequent negative impact on spending. In addition, a self-sustaining increase in demand, including pent-up demand, is projected to continue in both the constraints waning. For these reasons, the economy is likely to continue recovering. Specifically, in the household sector, private consumption is projected to recover, particularly led by the materialization of pent-up demand, as the situation with COVID-19 improves and as the resumption of consumption activities progresses while public health is being protected, mainly due to the widespread vaccinations and the rollout of antiviral medicines. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to increase, mainly for automobile-related goods, for which the effects of supply-side constraints are expected to wane, and for digital-related goods, which have seen an expansion in global demand. This is based on the projection that overseas economies will continue recovering on the whole, despite downward pressure from the situation surrounding Ukraine. Although raw material cost increases are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, albeit with variation across industries and firm yen's depreciation. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear as accommodative financial conditions provide support and supply-side constraints wane, although weakness is projected to remain for the time being in investment by the face-to-face services sector. Meanwhile, government spending is expected to be at a high level on the whole since it is projected that expenditure related to COVID-19 will continue, reflecting the government's past economic measures. From the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, as the negative impact of high gradually in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate because the positive contribution of the materialization of pent-up demand is projected to wane. In the household sector, employee income is likely to continue increasing moderately on the back of a rise in the number of non-regular employees associated with a recovery in the face-to-face services sector and of an increase in wage inflation that mainly reflects tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to this increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing steadily, although the materialization of pent-up demand is likely to slow. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to continue increasing moderately because it is projected that the growth in overseas economies, albeit decelerating, will stay at around the long-term dissipate. Corporate profits are likely to return to an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to keep increasing and downward pressure stemming from raw material cost increases is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor shortage, digital-related investment, and Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In addition, backed by the Bank's measures to support financing, the government's measures, and efforts made by private financial institutions, firms' financial positions -- including those of small and medium-sized ones, for which weakness has remained to date -- are likely to continue on an improving trend along with an economic recovery. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to the rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's measures to transform the economic structure toward the post-COVID-19 The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase in fiscal 2022, when the effects of a reduction in mobile phone charges dissipate. Thereafter, however, the rate of increase is expected to decelerate because the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane. Meanwhile, in terms of inflation excluding energy, for which prices fluctuate significantly, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is expected to moderately The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been negative recently. However, with Japan's economy following a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, it is 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be marginally positive. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. projected to turn clearly positive around the second half of fiscal 2022 and then continue to expand moderately. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify gradually. This is likely to contribute to improvement in households' tolerance of price rises and, coupled with the tight supply and demand conditions for goods and services, lead to a rise Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen, albeit at a moderate pace relative to short-term ones. Firms' price-setting stance has become increasingly active as a result of upward pressure remaining on costs from preventive measures against COVID-19 and of the recent rise in commodity prices. It is therefore likely that the pass-through of cost increases and a rise in selling prices will become widely observed, particularly for goods. The increase in actual inflation is expected to lead to a further rise in households' and mechanism and, in turn, bring about a wider range of price rises, including for services, Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay particular attention to the following upside and downside risks, which are associated mainly with the course of COVID-19 and the situation surrounding Ukraine. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on private consumption as well as on firms' export and production activities. There seems to be persistent vigilance against COVID-19 by Japanese households, particularly seniors, as evidenced by their behavior during the spread of the Omicron variant since the beginning of the year. If this tendency continues and people become less willing to go out, for example, due to factors such as the spread of highly contagious new variants, there is a risk that the materialization of pent-up demand will be delayed and private consumption will be pushed down. On the other hand, if people's vigilance against COVID-19 lessens significantly with the widespread vaccinations and the rollout of antiviral medicines, household savings that have accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions could be withdrawn by more than expected and private consumption could be pushed up. In the meantime, with global remaining tight, there is a possibility that supply-side constraints become prolonged and amplified due, for example, to a resurgence of COVID-19 at home and abroad, the supply-chain disruptions. If this happens, Japan's exports and production could be pushed down and the adverse impact could even spill over to goods consumption and business fixed investment. The second factor is developments in commodity prices. Commodity prices have risen on economic activity; these prices have recently been under increasing upward pressure even from the supply side due to heightened geopolitical risks concerning the situation surrounding Ukraine, in addition to the existing moves toward decarbonization. Since the rise in commodity prices due to supply factors is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports, it puts greater downward pressure on this reason, if high commodity prices persist, Japan's economy could deviate downward from the baseline scenario through deterioration in the terms of trade. On the other hand, if these prices decline significantly on the back of, for example, an easing of geopolitical tensions, the economy could deviate upward through improvement in the terms of trade. The third factor is developments in global financial and capital markets and in overseas monetary accommodation -- mainly for advanced economies facing a continued rise in inflation -- global financial conditions could tighten by more than expected through, for example, adjustments in risk asset prices and capital outflows from emerging economies. If this occurs, there is a risk that overseas economies will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. Furthermore, depending on the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine, overseas economies, particularly the euro area, which has strong economic relations with Russia and Ukraine, could be pushed down through the channels of a become clearer due, for example, to adjustments in its real estate sector, with the medium- to long-term growth potential declining gradually. The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that efforts with a view to the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization, and decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Depending on how households and firms growth rate, and the output gap could go either upward or downward. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. Depending on the degree of upward pass-through of cost increases to selling prices could accelerate by more than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, given that, in Japan, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily are deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen, households' tolerance of price rises will be slow to improve, and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. In particular, due to high uncertainties over the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine, fluctuations in international commodity prices have been significant recently. In this situation, the impact on overall prices through In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. Although it will take time, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually as an underlying trend toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19, including variants, and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In addition, there are extremely high uncertainties over developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in commodity prices, global financial and capital markets, and overseas economies. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 and the situation surrounding Ukraine, but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for the time being, mainly 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" reflecting uncertainties over energy prices, but are generally balanced thereafter. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole, despite markets, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels. 0.8 Forecasts made in January 2022  Forecasts made in January 2022  Forecasts made in January 2022  Notes: 1.

The implementation of the budget based on the aforementioned measures is expected to support economic activity, mainly in government consumption and private consumption. The government also formulated comprehensive emergency measures to counter sharply rising crude oil prices, commodity prices, and the like in April 2022. activity progresses around the world while public health is being protected and as the restrictions are lifted. Private consumption is expected to be pushed down by deterioration in real income due to rises in energy and food prices. However, it is projected to recover, particularly on the back of gradually while public health is being protected, and other items waning and employee income continuing to improve, private consumption is expected to keep increasing, albeit more slowly. Employee income is likely to increase moderately. This is because, while employment of regular workers is projected to remain firm, due mainly to face-to-face services is also expected to improve external demand. Another reason is that wage inflation is likely to increase, mainly due to tightening labor market conditions and price rises. An uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear. This is based on the will remain at high levels on the whole, and that there will be medium- to long-term investment spending, which includes investment to address public investment is projected to be more or less flat with construction related to building national resilience being at a high level. Government consumption is likely to remain at a high level as a included in the government's economic measures, such as regarding enhancement of the COVID-19 thereafter see a lowering in its level due to a Reflecting these developments in demand both at is expected to be at a relatively high level for fiscal 2022. This is based on the projection that, although domestic demand will be pushed down prices, the growth rate will be supported by supply-side constraints waning. For fiscal 2023, commodity prices waning, the growth rate is projected to remain relatively high, although the pace of increase is likely to decelerate, mainly 2024 is expected to decelerate, mainly due to the waning of pent-up demand, but the economy is likely to continue growing at a pace slightly above continuing financial conditions being maintained. Comparing the projections with those presented in the rates for fiscal 2021 and 2022 are lower due to slowdown in overseas economies. The projected growth rate for fiscal 2023 is higher, partly owing rate seems to have remained marginally positive recently (Chart 4). This is because, although the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP) has increased slightly, working hours have continued on a downtrend, reflecting working-style reforms, and the pace of capital stock accumulation has decelerated as a fixed 2-10123458590950005101520 Potential growth rateChart 4:Potential Growth Ratey/y % chg.FYSource: Bank of Japan.Note: Figures are staff estimates.

This is based on the projection that (1) the TFP growth rate will increase moderately, mainly on the back (2) the pace of decline in working hours will slow accelerate cyclically. However, there remain high sectors, both of which aim at adapting to the including efforts addressing growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some latitude. Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In fiscal 2022, Japan's economy is likely to recover. This is because, although domestic demand, such as business fixed investment and private consumption, is expected to be pushed including crude oil, through deterioration in the terms of trade, it is projected that downward pressure stemming from COVID-19 on services consumption will wane and will ease gradually. Another reason is that an economic measures are likely to provide support. Specifically, goods exports are expected to keep increasing since it is projected that overseas economies will continue recovering on the whole, surrounding Ukraine, and that the effects of supply-side constraints will wane gradually. However, it is highly likely that exports will remain in distribution networks due to lockdowns in China. Private consumption is expected to be pushed down by deterioration in real income due to rises in energy and food prices. However, it is projected recover, particularly supported by gradually while public health is being protected, the rollout of antiviral medicines. An uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear because corporate profits are projected to are likely to wane gradually. That said, weakness is expected to remain for the time being in firms in the transportation industry, including government spending is projected to be more or less flat because public investment is projected to related to COVID-19 included in the government's economy is projected to remain relatively high commodity prices waning and domestic and external demand remaining on an uptrend. is likely to decelerate, mainly due to slower materialization goods exports are projected to continue increasing moderately, as overseas economies keep growing, albeit decelerating, and as the demand, which is categorized under services exports, is projected to increase, reflecting a Business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor investment for growth areas and to address environmental issues. Private consumption is expected to keep increasing, albeit more slowly. This is based on the projection that employee income will continue improve, downward pressure on real income stemming from past rises in energy and food prices will wane, and pent-up demand will continue to materialize, albeit more construction related to building national resilience expenditures are to provide support, government spending is expected to decline, reflecting the reduction in expenditure related to growth is likely to decelerate, mainly due to the waning of pent-up demand, Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at a pace slightly continuing being maintained. Goods exports are likely to continue increasing moderately while the growth rates of overseas economies are expected to converge average. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is projected to keep increasing on the back of a continued global recovery in travel demand. Business fixed is expected to continue to be supported by increases in investment to address investment for growth areas and to address environmental issues. However, it is likely to see due to adjustment pressure stemming from the demand is likely to wane, private consumption is projected to continue increasing moderately for continues to improve.

The outlook is based on the assumption that the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually and then almost subside toward the end of the projection period. It also is based on the premises that, while the impact remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 20 and 21, 2021. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies also have picked up, although the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 has been seen in part. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment deteriorated significantly but subsequently have improved gradually. Business fixed investment has stopped declining on the whole, albeit with variations across industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. Private consumption has picked up gradually as a trend, but downward pressure has increased recently on consumption of services, such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations. Housing investment has declined moderately. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but those for corporate financing have remained less so, as seen in weakness in firms' financial positions. On the price front, the has been negative, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign. Inflation expectations have weakened somewhat. Japan's economy, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, is likely to follow an improving trend, supported by a recovery in external demand, accommodative financial improvement is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID-19 continues. Specifically, downward pressure stemming from the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 is likely to remain strong for the time being, particularly in face-to-face services consumption. Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth This baseline scenario is based on the assumption that, while taking preventive measures against COVID-19 and improving economic activity simultaneously, the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually and then almost subside toward the end of the projection period. The outlook also is based on the premises that, in Japan, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Looking at the outlook for economic activity based on the assumption and premises in more detail, overseas economies are likely to continue improving, partly supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies, but the pace is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID-19 continues. manufacturing industry and trade are expected to follow an increasing trend, whereas the recovery is projected to be slow in the face-to-face services industry, which is susceptible to the impact of COVID-19. Thereafter, overseas economies are likely to continue improving toward the end of the projection period since the face-to-face services industry in particular is expected to see a marked recovery as the impact of COVID-19 almost Japan's exports of goods are projected to increase for a wide range of goods, including activity, although the pace of increase is likely to decelerate, mainly for automobile-related goods, due to a peaking-out of pent-up demand. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized as services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry restrictions in Japan and travel restrictions abroad continue but likely to recover thereafter along with a gradual easing in such restrictions. Private consumption is likely to continue picking up as a trend, supported also by the government's economic measures. However, downward pressure, stemming mainly from the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19, is expected to remain strong for the time being, particularly in face-to-face services consumption. Thereafter, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, an uptrend in private consumption is likely to become evident gradually, supported also by improvement in employee income. Although the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions are expected to support employment, the employment and income situation is projected to be under downward pressure for the time being against the background of low levels of corporate profits and worsening labor market conditions. The employment and income situation is likely to turn to an improving trend thereafter, with domestic and external demand recovering. Business fixed investment is expected to pick up, mainly for machinery investment by the manufacturing industry that reflects a rise in exports and production, although construction investment by the face-to-face services industry is projected to continue declining. Thereafter, business fixed investment is expected to increase, supported by improvement in corporate profits. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is projected to continue increasing clearly toward fiscal 2021, mainly reflecting the system, both of which are under the additional economic measures. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign.2 With economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, it is expected that prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity will be pushed down. The past decline in crude oil prices also is projected to push down the CPI through energy prices. Under these circumstances, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to continue weakening somewhat. Thereafter, downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with prices are likely to dissipate. Under these circumstances, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are expected to rise again. Curve Control.\" It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March 2020 in response to COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets.3 In addition, the government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms, through programs that provide loans guaranteed by the credit guarantee corporations and also quasi-capital funds. Under these circumstances, private financial institutions have actively fulfilled the functioning of financial intermediation. In this situation, although firms' financial positions have been weak, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, has remained accommodative. Tension has eased in financial markets. Financing, mainly of firms, is likely to remain under stress for the time being with a moderate pace of economic improvement, but owing to the Bank's and the government's measures, as well as efforts made by private financial institutions, the Bank 2 Based on specific assumptions, the direct effects of the \"Go To Travel\" campaign on the CPI are estimated to be minus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2020 and 0.1 percentage point for both fiscal 2021 and 2022. Major mobile phone carriers have made public new plans that include price cuts on charges, but this is not factored into the outlook for prices in this report since the impact of such plans could change depending on how they will be reflected in the CPI. 3 See \"Enhancement of Monetary Easing in Light of the Impact of the Outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)\" released on March 16, 2020, \"Enhancement of Monetary Easing\" released on April 27, 2020, \"Introduction of a New Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Financing Mainly of Small and Medium-Sized Firms\" released on May 22, 2020, and \"Statement on Monetary Policy\" released on December 18, 2020, in which the Bank made decisions such as on the extension of the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). considers that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are their impact on domestic and overseas economies. It is highly unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve, and there is a possibility that downward pressure on economic activity will increase due to the spread of COVID-19. Meanwhile, although the impact of COVID-19 could subside earlier than expected if vaccines become widely available, the The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the impact of COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if the issue of COVID-19 leads to, for example, active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection and an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, thereby having positive effects on economic activity such as further innovation. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's measures to transform the economic structure The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although COVID-19 has affected the financial side as well, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively, with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation has been ensured. However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. 4 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is uncertainties over firms' price-setting behavior amid the impact of COVID-19 on both the demand and supply sides of economic activity. A decrease in demand due to the impact of COVID-19 is likely to put downward pressure on prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity. On the other hand, firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been observed widely to date, given that one of the reasons for the current decrease in demand is vigilance against COVID-19 and that there have been supply-side constraints, such as limiting the number of customers to prevent circumstances, there are high uncertainties over how firms will set their prices and how this will affect general prices from a macro perspective. The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario, and thus continue to warrant attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. For the time being, downward pressure is expected to be put on prices with economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, and medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to weaken somewhat. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase gradually since downward pressure on them is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement. In addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and the 5 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the assumption that the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually and then almost subside toward the end of the projection period. It also is based on the premises that, while the impact remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

The outlook presented in this Outlook Report is based on the assumption that the third supplementary budget for fiscal 2020 and the initial budget for fiscal 2021 that are based on the comprehensive economic measures will be approved by the Diet and implemented, and will support economic activity accordingly. the Cabinet decided on consumption is likely to become evident gradually which were expanded in response to the current situation, and the measures to support financing are expected to provide support for employment, employee income is highly likely to remain on a downtrend for the time being, primarily for the decrease in bonuses that reflects low levels of corporate profits. Thereafter, such income is likely to turn to an improving trend while lagging behind Business fixed investment is projected to pick up, exports and production. Then, it is expected to increase, supported by accommodative financial public investment is likely to steadily increase, reflecting progress in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience, which is included in the additional economic measures decided by the Cabinet in December 2020. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is projected to continue increasing clearly toward fiscal 2021. This mainly reflects, in addition to a which are under Reflecting these developments in demand both at is expected to be significantly negative for fiscal 2020. However, supported by the additional financial conditions, it is likely to mark a relatively impact of COVID-19 is expected to wane. The rate is expected to continue to register firm growth improvement in overseas economies. Compared Outlook Report, the projected growth rates are somewhat higher, mainly for fiscal 2021, reflecting The potential growth rate seems to have declined to around 0 percent recently (Chart 3).9 This is largely because total factor productivity (TFP) has declined, mainly due to preventive measures working hours have been on a downtrend, mainly reflecting shorter operating hours. As for the outlook, the potential growth rate is expected to being. As a background to this, the growth of capital stock is projected to continue decelerating, the downtrend in working hours is likely to become moderate gradually and the TFP growth rate is projected to turn to an uptrend. That said, the potential growth rate is expected to rise 9 It should be noted that the potential growth rate is estimated using GDP with the new base year of 2015 and capital stock as a production factor with the previous base year of 2011. Thus, if the potential growth rate is recalculated using the Quarterly Estimates of Net Capital Stocks of Fixed Assets with the new base year that is to be released, the estimation results could be different. 2-10123458590950005101520 Potential growth rateChart 3:Potential Growth Ratey/y % chg.FYSource: Bank of Japan.Note: Based on staff estimations. The benchmark year is 2011 for the SNA data used in calculating figures for capital input. period. This is based on the projection that (1) the TFP growth rate will continue reflecting adaptation that were caused by COVID-19, allocation, (2) the pace of decline in working hours will slow, and (3) the growth of capital stock will accelerate cyclically. However, there is a that COVID-19 will bring about structural changes in people's working styles and widespread adoption of working from home and changes could lead to a trend that is different from the past one. Thus, the output gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with more latitude than usual. In addition, there are high uncertainties at this point among sectors, both of which are assumed to bring about a future rise in the TFP growth rate. Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In the second half of fiscal 2020, the economy is expected to continue picking up, stemming resurgence of COVID-19 is expected to remain industry. Goods exports are likely to decelerate, for automobile-related goods, but remain on an increasing trend, particularly for capital goods and IT-related goods. Business fixed investment is projected to pick up gradually on the whole; services industry is likely to continue decreasing, manufacturing industry is expected to increase, reflecting positive effects of exports. On the other hand, private consumption is highly likely to show growing signs of deceleration in the short run, since it is projected that private consumption will be pushed down from the income side due to a services consumption will remain somewhat weak, reflecting the spread of COVID-19 since the end tourism demand also is likely to remain stagnant for the time being with entry restrictions being maintained. Meanwhile, public is expected to continue increasing steadily due to expansion such as in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience. In addition, government consumption is likely to follow an uptrend, mainly reflecting overseas economies rise, an improving trend in Japan's economy is expected to become evident, partly supported by the additional economic conditions. Exports are likely to follow an uptrend the pace is expected to decelerate from that seen in the second half of fiscal 2020. With the impact of COVID-19 waning, private consumption is likely to increase, albeit only moderately, supported Olympic Games-related demand. Business fixed investment is expected to increase, although facilities and hotels, is likely to remain at a low level. This is because, with corporate profits improving, business fixed investment is projected to be pushed up by an undertaking of postponed digital-related investment such as to set up regard to government spending, owing to the to building national is increase steadily and government consumption is expected to continue showing a clear increase, mainly reflecting the In fiscal 2022, the economy is expected to continue growing firmly, with demand at home and abroad increasing in a well-balanced manner. Exports are likely to continue increasing clearly, reflecting improvement in overseas economies. In this situation, corporate profits are expected to follow their improving trend and business fixed investment is likely to continue increasing, mainly such as in areas related to the environment. Private consumption is expected to continue increasing while vigilance against COVID-19 by seniors wanes along with the impact subsiding in construction related building national resilience is projected to serve as support, government spending is likely to turn consumption is expected to decrease, mainly due Public investment has continued to increase moderately (Chart 4). The amount of public construction completed, which is a coincident indicator, has continued to increase moderately since early 2019. The value of public works contracted, as well as orders received for public construction, both of which are leading indicators, have been on a moderate uptrend, albeit with fluctuations, reflecting such progress as reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience.

In reflection of this plan, public works to push forward with disaster prevention, disaster mitigation, and building national resilience have been incorporated into the third supplementary budget for fiscal 2020 as major measures. Overseas economies have picked up, although the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 has been seen in part (Chart 5). With economic 2020 became significantly positive, on the back of fixed COVID-19 have surged and the stricter public health measures have taken effect in the United States and Europe. However, business sentiment globally has maintained its clear improving trend as respective countries generally have been addressing the spread of COVID-19 while taking have continued to increase firmly and almost recovered to the level seen around early 2020.11 Looking at developments by major region, the Chinese economy has continued to recover.

Based on the campaign period that has been announced at this point and the effects on the actual CPI estimated by the Statistics Bureau of Japan, the Bank estimates in the January 2021 Outlook Report that this campaign will push down both the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) and that in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) by around 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point from August 2020 through June 2021 (excluding January and February 2021, when the campaign will be suspended). On the other hand, it is assumed that the CPI will be pushed up by 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point from August 2021 through June 2022 (excluding January and February 2022), due to a dissipation of the effects of the campaign. Looking at the CPI by fiscal year, the effects of the campaign on the year-on-year rates of change in both the CPI (all items less fresh food) and the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) are estimated to be around minus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2020 and around 0.1 percentage point fiscal 2021 and 2022.

That said, firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been observed widely to date. As the background downturn, it seems that firms, mainly in the face-to-face services industry, which is confronted readily make price cuts that would lead to a because they have inevitably been facing cost increases for taking preventive measures against COVID-19 and avoiding creating crowds -- for example, conducting temperature checks and disinfection steps or reducing the number of seats industry has decreased while consumers' vigilance against COVID-19 remains strong. In addition, since there are significant discounts, mainly through the \"Go To\" campaign, there is less need for firms to cut prices at their own expense, and this could be another reason for them not to make price cuts.

Thereafter, as the negative impact of high commodity prices wanes and a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing, albeit more slowly, at a pace above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to increase temporarily to around 2 percent -- due to the impact of a significant rise in energy prices -- in fiscal 2022, when the effects of a reduction in mobile phone charges dissipate. Thereafter, however, the rate of increase is expected to decelerate because the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane. Meanwhile, in terms of inflation excluding energy, for which prices fluctuate significantly, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is expected to moderately increase in positive territory on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage inflation, and partly also of a pass-through of raw material cost increases to food in particular. \uf06c Comparing the projections through fiscal 2023 with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected growth rates for fiscal 2021 and 2022 are lower due to the effects of such factors as a resurgence of COVID-19, the rise in commodity prices, and a slowdown in overseas economies. However, the projected growth rate for fiscal 2023 is higher, partly owing to a rebound from the lower projection in the previous year. The projected rate of increase in the CPI for fiscal 2022 is significantly higher, mainly reflecting the impact of the rise in energy prices. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19, including variants, and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In addition, there are extremely high uncertainties over developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in commodity prices, global financial and capital markets, and overseas economies. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 and the situation surrounding Ukraine, but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for the time being, mainly reflecting uncertainties over energy prices, but are generally balanced thereafter. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on April 27 and 28, 2022. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although some weakness has been seen in economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase as a trend, despite the remaining effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have improved on the whole, but business sentiment has seen a pause in its improvement Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained relatively weak on the whole, although improvement has been seen in some parts. Private consumption has started picking up again, with downward pressure stemming from COVID-19, particularly on services consumption, waning. Housing investment has been more or less flat. Public investment has been relatively weak, albeit at a high level. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food), despite being affected by the reduction in mobile phone charges, has been in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent, reflecting price rises in energy and other items. Meanwhile, inflation expectations, particularly short-term ones, have risen. From the beginning to the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning and with the government's economic measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from the rise in commodity prices. as wheat, have seen a significant rise recently, mainly reflecting heightened supply concerns as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since Japan relies on imports for most of these commodities, rises in these prices bring about an outflow of income from Japan (i.e., trading losses), and put downward pressure on households' real income and corporate profits through rises in energy and food prices. That said, the government's measures against oil price hikes and the accumulation of household savings that has resulted from pandemic-related restrictions are expected to mitigate downward pressure on income and the consequent negative impact on spending. In addition, a self-sustaining increase in demand, including pent-up demand, is projected to continue in both the constraints waning. For these reasons, the economy is likely to continue recovering. Specifically, in the household sector, private consumption is projected to recover, particularly led by the materialization of pent-up demand, as the situation with COVID-19 improves and as the resumption of consumption activities progresses while public health is being protected, mainly due to the widespread vaccinations and the rollout of antiviral medicines. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to increase, mainly for automobile-related goods, for which the effects of supply-side constraints are expected to wane, and for digital-related goods, which have seen an expansion in global demand. This is based on the projection that overseas economies will continue recovering on the whole, despite downward pressure from the situation surrounding Ukraine. Although raw material cost increases are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, albeit with variation across industries and firm yen's depreciation. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear as accommodative financial conditions provide support and supply-side constraints wane, although weakness is projected to remain for the time being in investment by the face-to-face services sector. Meanwhile, government spending is expected to be at a high level on the whole since it is projected that expenditure related to COVID-19 will continue, reflecting the government's past economic measures. From the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, as the negative impact of high gradually in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate because the positive contribution of the materialization of pent-up demand is projected to wane. In the household sector, employee income is likely to continue increasing moderately on the back of a rise in the number of non-regular employees associated with a recovery in the face-to-face services sector and of an increase in wage inflation that mainly reflects tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to this increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing steadily, although the materialization of pent-up demand is likely to slow. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to continue increasing moderately because it is projected that the growth in overseas economies, albeit decelerating, will stay at around the long-term dissipate. Corporate profits are likely to return to an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to keep increasing and downward pressure stemming from raw material cost increases is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor shortage, digital-related investment, and Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In addition, backed by the Bank's measures to support financing, the government's measures, and efforts made by private financial institutions, firms' financial positions -- including those of small and medium-sized ones, for which weakness has remained to date -- are likely to continue on an improving trend along with an economic recovery. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to the rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's measures to transform the economic structure toward the post-COVID-19 The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase in fiscal 2022, when the effects of a reduction in mobile phone charges dissipate. Thereafter, however, the rate of increase is expected to decelerate because the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane. Meanwhile, in terms of inflation excluding energy, for which prices fluctuate significantly, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is expected to moderately The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been negative recently. However, with Japan's economy following a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, it is 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be marginally positive. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. projected to turn clearly positive around the second half of fiscal 2022 and then continue to expand moderately. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify gradually. This is likely to contribute to improvement in households' tolerance of price rises and, coupled with the tight supply and demand conditions for goods and services, lead to a rise Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen, albeit at a moderate pace relative to short-term ones. Firms' price-setting stance has become increasingly active as a result of upward pressure remaining on costs from preventive measures against COVID-19 and of the recent rise in commodity prices. It is therefore likely that the pass-through of cost increases and a rise in selling prices will become widely observed, particularly for goods. The increase in actual inflation is expected to lead to a further rise in households' and mechanism and, in turn, bring about a wider range of price rises, including for services, Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay particular attention to the following upside and downside risks, which are associated mainly with the course of COVID-19 and the situation surrounding Ukraine. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on private consumption as well as on firms' export and production activities. There seems to be persistent vigilance against COVID-19 by Japanese households, particularly seniors, as evidenced by their behavior during the spread of the Omicron variant since the beginning of the year. If this tendency continues and people become less willing to go out, for example, due to factors such as the spread of highly contagious new variants, there is a risk that the materialization of pent-up demand will be delayed and private consumption will be pushed down. On the other hand, if people's vigilance against COVID-19 lessens significantly with the widespread vaccinations and the rollout of antiviral medicines, household savings that have accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions could be withdrawn by more than expected and private consumption could be pushed up. In the meantime, with global remaining tight, there is a possibility that supply-side constraints become prolonged and amplified due, for example, to a resurgence of COVID-19 at home and abroad, the supply-chain disruptions. If this happens, Japan's exports and production could be pushed down and the adverse impact could even spill over to goods consumption and business fixed investment. The second factor is developments in commodity prices. Commodity prices have risen on economic activity; these prices have recently been under increasing upward pressure even from the supply side due to heightened geopolitical risks concerning the situation surrounding Ukraine, in addition to the existing moves toward decarbonization. Since the rise in commodity prices due to supply factors is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports, it puts greater downward pressure on this reason, if high commodity prices persist, Japan's economy could deviate downward from the baseline scenario through deterioration in the terms of trade. On the other hand, if these prices decline significantly on the back of, for example, an easing of geopolitical tensions, the economy could deviate upward through improvement in the terms of trade. The third factor is developments in global financial and capital markets and in overseas monetary accommodation -- mainly for advanced economies facing a continued rise in inflation -- global financial conditions could tighten by more than expected through, for example, adjustments in risk asset prices and capital outflows from emerging economies. If this occurs, there is a risk that overseas economies will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. Furthermore, depending on the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine, overseas economies, particularly the euro area, which has strong economic relations with Russia and Ukraine, could be pushed down through the channels of a become clearer due, for example, to adjustments in its real estate sector, with the medium- to long-term growth potential declining gradually. The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that efforts with a view to the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization, and decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Depending on how households and firms growth rate, and the output gap could go either upward or downward. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. Depending on the degree of upward pass-through of cost increases to selling prices could accelerate by more than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, given that, in Japan, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily are deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen, households' tolerance of price rises will be slow to improve, and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. In particular, due to high uncertainties over the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine, fluctuations in international commodity prices have been significant recently. In this situation, the impact on overall prices through In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. Although it will take time, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually as an underlying trend toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19, including variants, and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In addition, there are extremely high uncertainties over developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in commodity prices, global financial and capital markets, and overseas economies. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 and the situation surrounding Ukraine, but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for the time being, mainly 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" reflecting uncertainties over energy prices, but are generally balanced thereafter. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole, despite markets, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels. 0.8 Forecasts made in January 2022  Forecasts made in January 2022  Forecasts made in January 2022  Notes: 1.

Specifically, downward pressure stemming from the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 is likely to remain strong for the time being, particularly in face-to-face services consumption.

It also is based on the premises that, while the impact remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 20 and 21, 2021. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies also have picked up, although the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 has been seen in part. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment deteriorated significantly but subsequently have improved gradually. Business fixed investment has stopped declining on the whole, albeit with variations across industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. Private consumption has picked up gradually as a trend, but downward pressure has increased recently on consumption of services, such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations. Housing investment has declined moderately. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but those for corporate financing have remained less so, as seen in weakness in firms' financial positions. On the price front, the has been negative, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign. Inflation expectations have weakened somewhat. Japan's economy, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, is likely to follow an improving trend, supported by a recovery in external demand, accommodative financial improvement is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID-19 continues. Specifically, downward pressure stemming from the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 is likely to remain strong for the time being, particularly in face-to-face services consumption. Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth This baseline scenario is based on the assumption that, while taking preventive measures against COVID-19 and improving economic activity simultaneously, the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually and then almost subside toward the end of the projection period. The outlook also is based on the premises that, in Japan, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Looking at the outlook for economic activity based on the assumption and premises in more detail, overseas economies are likely to continue improving, partly supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies, but the pace is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID-19 continues. manufacturing industry and trade are expected to follow an increasing trend, whereas the recovery is projected to be slow in the face-to-face services industry, which is susceptible to the impact of COVID-19. Thereafter, overseas economies are likely to continue improving toward the end of the projection period since the face-to-face services industry in particular is expected to see a marked recovery as the impact of COVID-19 almost Japan's exports of goods are projected to increase for a wide range of goods, including activity, although the pace of increase is likely to decelerate, mainly for automobile-related goods, due to a peaking-out of pent-up demand. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized as services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry restrictions in Japan and travel restrictions abroad continue but likely to recover thereafter along with a gradual easing in such restrictions. Private consumption is likely to continue picking up as a trend, supported also by the government's economic measures. However, downward pressure, stemming mainly from the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19, is expected to remain strong for the time being, particularly in face-to-face services consumption. Thereafter, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, an uptrend in private consumption is likely to become evident gradually, supported also by improvement in employee income. Although the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions are expected to support employment, the employment and income situation is projected to be under downward pressure for the time being against the background of low levels of corporate profits and worsening labor market conditions. The employment and income situation is likely to turn to an improving trend thereafter, with domestic and external demand recovering. Business fixed investment is expected to pick up, mainly for machinery investment by the manufacturing industry that reflects a rise in exports and production, although construction investment by the face-to-face services industry is projected to continue declining. Thereafter, business fixed investment is expected to increase, supported by improvement in corporate profits. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is projected to continue increasing clearly toward fiscal 2021, mainly reflecting the system, both of which are under the additional economic measures. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign.2 With economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, it is expected that prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity will be pushed down. The past decline in crude oil prices also is projected to push down the CPI through energy prices. Under these circumstances, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to continue weakening somewhat. Thereafter, downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with prices are likely to dissipate. Under these circumstances, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are expected to rise again. Curve Control.\" It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March 2020 in response to COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets.3 In addition, the government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms, through programs that provide loans guaranteed by the credit guarantee corporations and also quasi-capital funds. Under these circumstances, private financial institutions have actively fulfilled the functioning of financial intermediation. In this situation, although firms' financial positions have been weak, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, has remained accommodative. Tension has eased in financial markets. Financing, mainly of firms, is likely to remain under stress for the time being with a moderate pace of economic improvement, but owing to the Bank's and the government's measures, as well as efforts made by private financial institutions, the Bank 2 Based on specific assumptions, the direct effects of the \"Go To Travel\" campaign on the CPI are estimated to be minus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2020 and 0.1 percentage point for both fiscal 2021 and 2022. Major mobile phone carriers have made public new plans that include price cuts on charges, but this is not factored into the outlook for prices in this report since the impact of such plans could change depending on how they will be reflected in the CPI. 3 See \"Enhancement of Monetary Easing in Light of the Impact of the Outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)\" released on March 16, 2020, \"Enhancement of Monetary Easing\" released on April 27, 2020, \"Introduction of a New Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Financing Mainly of Small and Medium-Sized Firms\" released on May 22, 2020, and \"Statement on Monetary Policy\" released on December 18, 2020, in which the Bank made decisions such as on the extension of the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). considers that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are their impact on domestic and overseas economies. It is highly unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve, and there is a possibility that downward pressure on economic activity will increase due to the spread of COVID-19. Meanwhile, although the impact of COVID-19 could subside earlier than expected if vaccines become widely available, the The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the impact of COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if the issue of COVID-19 leads to, for example, active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection and an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, thereby having positive effects on economic activity such as further innovation. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's measures to transform the economic structure The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although COVID-19 has affected the financial side as well, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively, with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation has been ensured. However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. 4 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is uncertainties over firms' price-setting behavior amid the impact of COVID-19 on both the demand and supply sides of economic activity. A decrease in demand due to the impact of COVID-19 is likely to put downward pressure on prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity. On the other hand, firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been observed widely to date, given that one of the reasons for the current decrease in demand is vigilance against COVID-19 and that there have been supply-side constraints, such as limiting the number of customers to prevent circumstances, there are high uncertainties over how firms will set their prices and how this will affect general prices from a macro perspective. The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario, and thus continue to warrant attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. For the time being, downward pressure is expected to be put on prices with economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, and medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to weaken somewhat. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase gradually since downward pressure on them is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement. In addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and the 5 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the assumption that the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually and then almost subside toward the end of the projection period. It also is based on the premises that, while the impact remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.

Business sentiment has deteriorated, and the deceleration in the pace of increase in business fixed investment has become evident recently. With the growing impact of the spread of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has started to show some weakness, and private consumption has decreased significantly, mainly in services such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations.

As for inflation expectations, relatively weak indicators have been observed. Japan's economy is likely to remain in a severe situation for the time being due to the The world currently is in a pandemic; the outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified in China and it spread rapidly worldwide, including to Asia, Europe, and the United States. Economic activity has been disrupted significantly as a result of preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19 taken by each country and region, such as restrictions on going outside and immigration/emigration, as well as orders to suspend business and production activities. Until the spread of COVID-19 subsides, economic activity is likely to remain constrained and thus overseas economies are expected to remain depressed. In this situation, Japan's exports, including inbound tourism consumption, are likely to remain weak. Despite being supported by the government's economic measures, domestic demand, mainly in terms of private consumption, is expected to remain weak, with economic activity being constrained due to the impact of the spread of COVID-19. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been positive but is likely to be somewhat weak for the time being, mainly affected by the spread of COVID-19 and the decline in In this Outlook Report, while there are extremely high uncertainties over the outlook for economic activity from a somewhat long-term perspective, it is assumed that the impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the economy will wane on a global basis through the second Based on this assumption, the growth pace of overseas economies is likely to increase. This is because, from around the second half of 2020, pent-up demand and a recovery in production from the decline brought about by the spread of COVID-19 are expected to macroeconomic policies taken by each country and region are likely to materialize. Japan's economy also is expected to improve as the impact of the spread of COVID-19 wanes at home and abroad. Exports are likely to head toward an increase again with the growth pace of overseas economies rising. In addition, domestic demand is expected to turn toward a pick-up and then increase, supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures, as well as through the expected As for prices, with the economy improving in such a manner, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, global financial and capital markets have been unstable and corporate financing has been affected globally, both reflecting the spread of COVID-19. That said, the government and central bank of each country and region have been making responses aggressively, with a view to maintaining stability in financial markets and ensuring smooth corporate financing. In Japan, the government has implemented various measures to support corporate Curve Control,\" the Bank has implemented various powerful monetary easing measures since March with a view to ensuring smooth financing, such as of firms, and maintaining 2 According to the baseline scenario in the April 2020 World Economic Outlook released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it is assumed that the pandemic will fade in the second half of 2020 and containment measures taken by each country and region will be lifted gradually. The outlook for economic activity and prices presented in this Outlook Report generally is based on the same assumption. stability in financial markets.3 In this situation, it is expected that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 The outlook for economic activity and prices is extremely unclear, as it could change depending on the timing of the spread of COVID-19 subsiding and on the magnitude of the impact on domestic and overseas economies. In addition, the aforementioned outlook is based mainly on the assumption that, while the impact of the spread of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained, although this assumption entails high uncertainties. Major upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices are as follows. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. Regarding the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay attention to the following three risks in particular until the impact of the spread of COVID-19 subsides. The first is the impact of the spread of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are high uncertainties regarding the consequences of the spread of COVID-19, the economies until the spread subsides. As it is difficult at this point to envisage when effective medicines and vaccines can be developed, it is highly unclear how long it will take for the spread of COVID-19 to subside. In addition, with regard to preventive measures against this spread, such as stay-at-home orders or requests, it is difficult to predict the magnitude of their impact on the economy. Moreover, there are high The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline, triggered mainly by the spread of COVID-19 becoming prolonged, there is a risk that their appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the spread subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if the issue of COVID-19 leads to an active use of various types of information 3 See \"Enhancement of Monetary Easing in Light of the Impact of the Outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)\" released on March 16, 2020 and \"Enhancement of Monetary Easing\" released on April 27, 2020. 4 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. and communication technology in the face of the restrictions on going outside, thereby having positive effects on the field of digital technology, such as further innovation. The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although it is under severe stress due to the impact of the spread of COVID-19, the Bank and the government have been taking measures aggressively, with a view to ensuring smooth financing, such as of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole.5 However, if the impact of the spread of COVID-19 lasts longer than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to developments in international commodity prices, including those of crude oil, and to the effects of future (Reference) Excluding the effects of the consumption tax hike and policies concerning the provision of free education 0.4 to -0.1 Forecasts made in January 2020 5.0 to -3.0 0.7 to -0.3 0.8 to -0.4 Forecasts made in January 2020 Forecasts made in January 2020 Notes: 1. Given that there are higher uncertainties regarding the outlook, in the April Outlook Report, each Policy Board member made their forecasts as a range and submitted two figures (i.e., the highest and lowest figures) within the range of 1.0 percentage point at most. The forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members are shown as a range excluding four figures -- namely, the two highest figures and two lowest figures among the forecasts of the nine members. (If a member submits the same forecast figure for the highest and lowest figures, it is counted as two separate figures.) In the January Outlook Report, the forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members also were shown as a range, excluding the highest and lowest figures, but each member's forecasts took the form of point estimates. Thus, it should be noted that the definition of the forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members in the January Outlook Report is different from that in the April Outlook Report. 2.

", "file5": "\uf06c Japan's economy is likely to recover toward the middle of the projection period, with the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and supply-side constraints waning, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from high commodity prices and slowdowns in overseas economies. Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to be relatively high in the short run due to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. The rate of increase is then expected to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023 due to a waning of these effects, as well as to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately on the back of improvement in the output gap, rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth, and a waning of the effects of the economic measures pushing down energy prices toward the middle of fiscal 2023. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected growth rates for fiscal 2022 and 2023 are somewhat lower, mainly due to overseas economies deviating downward from the previous baseline scenario, although the government's economic measures are likely to make a positive contribution to the growth rates. The projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat lower due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing up the economy of the previous year. The projected rates of increase in the CPI for fiscal 2022 and 2023 are more or less unchanged, as effects such as those of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices are likely to offset the effects of pushing down energy prices from the economic measures. The projected rate of increase in the CPI for fiscal 2024 is somewhat higher due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down energy prices of the previous year. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices; and the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact. In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2022 and 2023 but are generally balanced for fiscal 2024. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 17 and 18, 2023. Japan's economy, despite being affected by factors such as high commodity prices, has picked up as the resumption of economic activity has progressed while public health has been protected from COVID-19. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Exports and industrial production have increased as a trend, with the effects of supply-side constraints waning. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has been more or less unchanged. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole. Private consumption has increased moderately, despite being affected by COVID-19. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been in the range of 3.5-4.0 percent due to rises in expectations have risen. Toward the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning and with support from it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from high commodity prices and In the household sector, regarding the employment situation, the number of regular employees is expected to continue increasing, and a rise in that of non-regular employees is likely to become evident with a recovery in the face-to-face services sector. In addition, wage growth is expected to increase, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing moderately. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be under downward pressure from the real income side due to price rises, it is projected to continue increasing. This is mainly because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions, as the resumption of consumption activities progresses further while public health is being protected. Private consumption is also likely to be underpinned by the government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and manufactured and piped gas charges, and by its domestic travel discount program. In the corporate sector, although overseas economies are projected to slow, mainly due to exports and production are likely to remain on an uptrend with the effects of supply-side constraints waning and with support from high levels of order backlogs for automobiles and capital goods. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is also expected to increase, mainly in reflection of the government's relaxation of entry restrictions. Although high raw material costs are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, albeit with variation across industries and firm sizes. This will likely occur due to continued improvement in this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support and supply-side constraints wane, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including to address development (R&D) investment related to growth areas and decarbonization, and investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline gradually in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19. From the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate due to a waning of the contribution from the materialization of measures pushing up the economy of the previous year. In the household sector, employee income is likely to continue increasing on the back of a moderate rise in the number of employees associated with improvement in economic activity and of an increase in wage growth that reflects tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Supported by this increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing steadily, although the materialization of pent-up demand is likely to slow. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to increase moderately with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to continue on an improving trend along Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be cost increases led by a rise in import prices. The rate of increase is then expected to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately on the back of improvement in the output gap, rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth, and a waning of the effects of the economic measures pushing down energy prices toward the middle of fiscal 2023. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and manufactured and piped gas charges are expected to push down the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food), mainly for the first half of fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are likely to push up the rate due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices, such as in gasoline prices, electricity charges, and manufactured and piped gas charges -- the year-on-year rate of change is projected to be at around 2 percent for fiscal The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been marginally negative. With Japan's economy following a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, the gap 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. is projected to turn positive around the second half of fiscal 2022 and then continue to expand moderately. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify gradually. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen, albeit at a moderate pace relative to short-term ones. The December 2022 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has increased and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, an increase in actual inflation is expected to bring about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations labor-management wage negotiations, lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, there are extremely high uncertainties, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in Specifically, it is necessary to pay attention to the following upside and downside risks. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates, such as in the United States, are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to raise their policy interest rates, and such moves are projected to continue for the time being. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow moderately, albeit at a decelerating pace. That said, vigilance against a wage-price spiral has remained high, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. With central banks continuing to make policy interest rate hikes, there is a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further through adjustments in asset prices, fluctuations in foreign exchange markets, and capital outflows from emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking this risk into account, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the course of this situation, overseas economies, particularly the euro area, could be pushed down further. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, they could rise again depending on, for example, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. Such deterioration in the terms of trade squeezes corporate profits and households' real income, and this could lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. On this point, in the baseline scenario, commodity prices are assumed to decline moderately on the whole toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. However, there are extremely surrounding Ukraine -- and global efforts toward addressing climate change. The third factor is how COVID-19 at home and abroad will affect private consumption and firms' export and production activities. Although COVID-19 has resurged in Japan since last autumn, private consumption has increased moderately thus far -- supported by consumption activities has progressed steadily while public health has been protected. That said, depending on the course of COVID-19, upward pressure from pent-up demand could weaken by more than expected. On the other hand, if vigilance against COVID-19 that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions could be withdrawn by more than expected and private consumption could be pushed up. In the meantime, supply-side constraints have remained in part, and if COVID-19 resurges at home and abroad in this situation, such constraints could intensify again through, for example, supply-chain disruptions. If this happens, Japan's exports and production could be pushed down and the adverse impact could even spill over to goods consumption and business fixed investment. The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that efforts with a view to the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization, and decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. In addition, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these changes, their could go either upward or downward. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. Recently, against the backdrop of high raw material costs, price hikes have been widely observed even among firms that had taken a cautious stance toward changing their selling prices, while their pricing decisions have been made in consideration of price setting by competitors. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through of cost increases could accelerate by more than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, there is a possibility that wages and prices will rise by more than expected as more firms reflect price developments in wage setting through labor-management wage negotiations. On the other hand, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario, with the deeply entrenched behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Fluctuations in international commodity prices have been significant, reflecting high uncertainties over, for example, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, while inflation rates have remained high on a global basis and foreign exchange markets have fluctuated sharply. How these factors will affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been above 2 percent. The rate of increase, however, is expected to decelerate to a level below 2 percent toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Although it will take time, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2022 and 2023 but are generally balanced for fiscal 2024. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the global financial markets, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is expected to be somewhat weak for the time being, mainly affected by the spread of COVID-19 and the decline in crude oil prices. \uf06c Thereafter, as the impact of the spread of COVID-19 wanes at home and abroad, Japan's economy is likely to improve, supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures, as well as through the expected materialization of pent-up demand (i.e., demand that has been constrained) and a projected recovery in production from the decline brought about by the spread of COVID-19. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually. In this Outlook Report, the impact of the spread of COVID-19 is assumed to wane on a global basis through the second half of 2020. \uf06c That said, future developments are extremely unclear, as they could change depending on the timing of the spread of COVID-19 subsiding and on the magnitude of the impact on domestic and overseas economies. The aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices is based mainly on the assumption that, while the impact of the spread of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained, although this assumption entails high uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to Japan's economy has been in an increasingly severe situation due to the impact of the spread of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies have become depressed rapidly, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this situation, exports and industrial production have declined. Business sentiment has deteriorated, and the deceleration in the pace of increase in business fixed investment has become evident recently. With the growing impact of the spread of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has started to show some weakness, and private consumption has decreased significantly, mainly in services such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations. Meanwhile, housing investment has been more or less flat and public investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but less so in terms of corporate financing, as seen in deterioration in firms' less fresh food, and the same hereafter) is at around 0.5 percent. As for inflation expectations, relatively weak indicators have been observed. Japan's economy is likely to remain in a severe situation for the time being due to the The world currently is in a pandemic; the outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified in China and it spread rapidly worldwide, including to Asia, Europe, and the United States. Economic activity has been disrupted significantly as a result of preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19 taken by each country and region, such as restrictions on going outside and immigration/emigration, as well as orders to suspend business and production activities. Until the spread of COVID-19 subsides, economic activity is likely to remain constrained and thus overseas economies are expected to remain depressed. In this situation, Japan's exports, including inbound tourism consumption, are likely to remain weak. Despite being supported by the government's economic measures, domestic demand, mainly in terms of private consumption, is expected to remain weak, with economic activity being constrained due to the impact of the spread of COVID-19. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been positive but is likely to be somewhat weak for the time being, mainly affected by the spread of COVID-19 and the decline in In this Outlook Report, while there are extremely high uncertainties over the outlook for economic activity from a somewhat long-term perspective, it is assumed that the impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the economy will wane on a global basis through the second Based on this assumption, the growth pace of overseas economies is likely to increase. This is because, from around the second half of 2020, pent-up demand and a recovery in production from the decline brought about by the spread of COVID-19 are expected to macroeconomic policies taken by each country and region are likely to materialize. Japan's economy also is expected to improve as the impact of the spread of COVID-19 wanes at home and abroad. Exports are likely to head toward an increase again with the growth pace of overseas economies rising. In addition, domestic demand is expected to turn toward a pick-up and then increase, supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures, as well as through the expected As for prices, with the economy improving in such a manner, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, global financial and capital markets have been unstable and corporate financing has been affected globally, both reflecting the spread of COVID-19. That said, the government and central bank of each country and region have been making responses aggressively, with a view to maintaining stability in financial markets and ensuring smooth corporate financing. In Japan, the government has implemented various measures to support corporate Curve Control,\" the Bank has implemented various powerful monetary easing measures since March with a view to ensuring smooth financing, such as of firms, and maintaining 2 According to the baseline scenario in the April 2020 World Economic Outlook released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it is assumed that the pandemic will fade in the second half of 2020 and containment measures taken by each country and region will be lifted gradually. The outlook for economic activity and prices presented in this Outlook Report generally is based on the same assumption. stability in financial markets.3 In this situation, it is expected that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 The outlook for economic activity and prices is extremely unclear, as it could change depending on the timing of the spread of COVID-19 subsiding and on the magnitude of the impact on domestic and overseas economies. In addition, the aforementioned outlook is based mainly on the assumption that, while the impact of the spread of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained, although this assumption entails high uncertainties. Major upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices are as follows. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. Regarding the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay attention to the following three risks in particular until the impact of the spread of COVID-19 subsides. The first is the impact of the spread of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are high uncertainties regarding the consequences of the spread of COVID-19, the economies until the spread subsides. As it is difficult at this point to envisage when effective medicines and vaccines can be developed, it is highly unclear how long it will take for the spread of COVID-19 to subside. In addition, with regard to preventive measures against this spread, such as stay-at-home orders or requests, it is difficult to predict the magnitude of their impact on the economy. Moreover, there are high The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline, triggered mainly by the spread of COVID-19 becoming prolonged, there is a risk that their appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the spread subsides.

The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although it is under severe stress due to the impact of the spread of COVID-19, the Bank and the government have been taking measures aggressively, with a view to ensuring smooth financing, such as of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole.5 However, if the impact of the spread of COVID-19 lasts longer than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to developments in international commodity prices, including those of crude oil, and to the effects of future (Reference) Excluding the effects of the consumption tax hike and policies concerning the provision of free education 0.4 to -0.1 Forecasts made in January 2020 5.0 to -3.0 0.7 to -0.3 0.8 to -0.4 Forecasts made in January 2020 Forecasts made in January 2020 Notes: 1. Given that there are higher uncertainties regarding the outlook, in the April Outlook Report, each Policy Board member made their forecasts as a range and submitted two figures (i.e., the highest and lowest figures) within the range of 1.0 percentage point at most. The forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members are shown as a range excluding four figures -- namely, the two highest figures and two lowest figures among the forecasts of the nine members. (If a member submits the same forecast figure for the highest and lowest figures, it is counted as two separate figures.) In the January Outlook Report, the forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members also were shown as a range, excluding the highest and lowest figures, but each member's forecasts took the form of point estimates. Thus, it should be noted that the definition of the forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members in the January Outlook Report is different from that in the April Outlook Report. 2.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to be relatively high in the short run due to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. The rate of increase is then expected to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023 due to a waning of these effects, as well as to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately on the back of improvement in the output gap, rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth, and a waning of the effects of the economic measures pushing down energy prices toward the middle of fiscal 2023. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected growth rates for fiscal 2022 and 2023 are somewhat lower, mainly due to overseas economies deviating downward from the previous baseline scenario, although the government's economic measures are likely to make a positive contribution to the growth rates. The projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat lower due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing up the economy of the previous year. The projected rates of increase in the CPI for fiscal 2022 and 2023 are more or less unchanged, as effects such as those of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices are likely to offset the effects of pushing down energy prices from the economic measures. The projected rate of increase in the CPI for fiscal 2024 is somewhat higher due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down energy prices of the previous year. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices; and the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact. In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2022 and 2023 but are generally balanced for fiscal 2024. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 17 and 18, 2023. Japan's economy, despite being affected by factors such as high commodity prices, has picked up as the resumption of economic activity has progressed while public health has been protected from COVID-19. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Exports and industrial production have increased as a trend, with the effects of supply-side constraints waning. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has been more or less unchanged. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole. Private consumption has increased moderately, despite being affected by COVID-19. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been in the range of 3.5-4.0 percent due to rises in expectations have risen. Toward the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning and with support from it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from high commodity prices and In the household sector, regarding the employment situation, the number of regular employees is expected to continue increasing, and a rise in that of non-regular employees is likely to become evident with a recovery in the face-to-face services sector. In addition, wage growth is expected to increase, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing moderately. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be under downward pressure from the real income side due to price rises, it is projected to continue increasing. This is mainly because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions, as the resumption of consumption activities progresses further while public health is being protected. Private consumption is also likely to be underpinned by the government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and manufactured and piped gas charges, and by its domestic travel discount program. In the corporate sector, although overseas economies are projected to slow, mainly due to exports and production are likely to remain on an uptrend with the effects of supply-side constraints waning and with support from high levels of order backlogs for automobiles and capital goods. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is also expected to increase, mainly in reflection of the government's relaxation of entry restrictions. Although high raw material costs are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, albeit with variation across industries and firm sizes. This will likely occur due to continued improvement in this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support and supply-side constraints wane, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including to address development (R&D) investment related to growth areas and decarbonization, and investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline gradually in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19. From the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate due to a waning of the contribution from the materialization of measures pushing up the economy of the previous year. In the household sector, employee income is likely to continue increasing on the back of a moderate rise in the number of employees associated with improvement in economic activity and of an increase in wage growth that reflects tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Supported by this increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing steadily, although the materialization of pent-up demand is likely to slow. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to increase moderately with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to continue on an improving trend along Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be cost increases led by a rise in import prices. The rate of increase is then expected to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately on the back of improvement in the output gap, rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth, and a waning of the effects of the economic measures pushing down energy prices toward the middle of fiscal 2023. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and manufactured and piped gas charges are expected to push down the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food), mainly for the first half of fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are likely to push up the rate due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices, such as in gasoline prices, electricity charges, and manufactured and piped gas charges -- the year-on-year rate of change is projected to be at around 2 percent for fiscal The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been marginally negative. With Japan's economy following a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, the gap 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. is projected to turn positive around the second half of fiscal 2022 and then continue to expand moderately. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify gradually. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen, albeit at a moderate pace relative to short-term ones. The December 2022 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has increased and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, an increase in actual inflation is expected to bring about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations labor-management wage negotiations, lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, there are extremely high uncertainties, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in Specifically, it is necessary to pay attention to the following upside and downside risks. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates, such as in the United States, are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to raise their policy interest rates, and such moves are projected to continue for the time being. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow moderately, albeit at a decelerating pace. That said, vigilance against a wage-price spiral has remained high, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. With central banks continuing to make policy interest rate hikes, there is a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further through adjustments in asset prices, fluctuations in foreign exchange markets, and capital outflows from emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking this risk into account, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the course of this situation, overseas economies, particularly the euro area, could be pushed down further. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, they could rise again depending on, for example, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. Such deterioration in the terms of trade squeezes corporate profits and households' real income, and this could lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. On this point, in the baseline scenario, commodity prices are assumed to decline moderately on the whole toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. However, there are extremely surrounding Ukraine -- and global efforts toward addressing climate change. The third factor is how COVID-19 at home and abroad will affect private consumption and firms' export and production activities. Although COVID-19 has resurged in Japan since last autumn, private consumption has increased moderately thus far -- supported by consumption activities has progressed steadily while public health has been protected. That said, depending on the course of COVID-19, upward pressure from pent-up demand could weaken by more than expected. On the other hand, if vigilance against COVID-19 that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions could be withdrawn by more than expected and private consumption could be pushed up. In the meantime, supply-side constraints have remained in part, and if COVID-19 resurges at home and abroad in this situation, such constraints could intensify again through, for example, supply-chain disruptions. If this happens, Japan's exports and production could be pushed down and the adverse impact could even spill over to goods consumption and business fixed investment. The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that efforts with a view to the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization, and decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. In addition, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these changes, their could go either upward or downward. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. Recently, against the backdrop of high raw material costs, price hikes have been widely observed even among firms that had taken a cautious stance toward changing their selling prices, while their pricing decisions have been made in consideration of price setting by competitors. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through of cost increases could accelerate by more than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, there is a possibility that wages and prices will rise by more than expected as more firms reflect price developments in wage setting through labor-management wage negotiations. On the other hand, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario, with the deeply entrenched behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Fluctuations in international commodity prices have been significant, reflecting high uncertainties over, for example, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, while inflation rates have remained high on a global basis and foreign exchange markets have fluctuated sharply. How these factors will affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been above 2 percent. The rate of increase, however, is expected to decelerate to a level below 2 percent toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Although it will take time, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2022 and 2023 but are generally balanced for fiscal 2024. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the global financial markets, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Real GDP increased clearly for the April-June quarter of 2022, registering 1.1 percent on a annualized basis (Chart 1). It then decreased slightly for the July-September quarter, registering and minus 0.8 percent on an annualized basis. The decrease was mainly due to the surge in imports of services caused by temporary factors. Looking at final demand, exports and business fixed investment increased, mainly on the back of consumption increased slightly, despite being affected by the spread of COVID-19 last summer. which captures the utilization of labor and capital -- for the July-September quarter was negative but improved from the previous quarter (Chart 2). then suggest that Japan's economy has continued to pick up.

The projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat lower due pushing up the economy of the previous year. The potential growth rate seems to have been in This is because, although the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP) has increased slightly, working hours have continued on a downtrend, reflecting working-style reforms, and growth in capital stock has decelerated as a result of past declines in business fixed investment. As for the outlook, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately. This is based on the projection allocation, (2) the pace of decline in working hours will slow with the effects of working-style reforms diminishing, and (3) growth in capital developments are likely to be encouraged by the terms of labor, it is highly uncertain what kind of working style will take hold going forward, given corporate sector, there remain high uncertainties production factors, both of which aim at adapting structures, including efforts toward digitalization and addressing climate change. It is also possible factors will have a significant impact on corporate gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In the second half of fiscal 2022, Japan's economy is likely to recover. This is because, although the economy is expected to be under stemming economies, it is projected that the impact of COVID-19 on services consumption will wane ease. Another reason is that accommodative economic measures are likely to provide support. Specifically, while goods exports are likely to be affected by economies, they are expected to remain on an Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is projected to increase, of entry restrictions. In the household sector, employee income is likely to continue increasing situation, private consumption is expected to be pushed down by deterioration in real income due to price rises. However, it is projected to continue increasing because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related activities progresses further while public health is being protected.

However, with the remaining effects of the slowdowns in overseas economies, it is likely to decelerate somewhat, mainly reflecting slower exports are projected to remain on an uptrend as although such exports will likely continue to be affected by economies. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including digital-related investment, investment related to investment associated with strengthening supply income is likely to continue rising. This is because, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises, wage growth is expected to rise not households' real income stemming from high prices is projected to ease on the back of a consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in measures.

The outlook for inbound tourism demand is examined from the perspectives of the number of visitor. First, the number of inbound visitors is highly likely to follow a clear increasing trend for the time being.

The projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 is significantly higher, mainly due to the fact that cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have been passed on to consumer prices to a greater extent than expected. The projected rates of increase in this CPI for fiscal 2024 and 2025 are more or less unchanged. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 and 2024. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 27 and 28, 2023. Japan's economy has recovered moderately. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has improved moderately. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has increased steadily at a moderate pace, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is slower than a while ago, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures, but it has been in the range of 3.0-3.5 percent recently owing to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Inflation expectations have shown some upward movements again. For the time being, Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately, supported by the materialization of pent-up demand, as well as by factors such as it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a slowdown in the pace of In the household sector, employment is likely to rise on the back of a recovery in economic activity. In addition, the rate of increase in nominal wages per employee is expected to accelerate as it gradually reflects the results of this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, which show that the wage growth rate agreed in the negotiations was significantly higher than in the previous year, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be affected by price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately. This is because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions, and because factors such as improvement in consumer sentiment, which mainly reflects a rise in wage growth, are expected to provide support. Private consumption is also likely to be underpinned by the government's measures, such as those to reduce the household In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies resulting mainly from the impact they are likely to be more or less flat due to factors such as a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. With economic activity continuing to recover, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, partly due to a waning of the impact of past high raw material costs and to progress in the pass-through of cost increases to selling prices. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support and the effects of supply-side constraints wane, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Regarding the outlook for Japan's economy after these developments, it is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period due to a In the household sector, employment is projected to continue rising, but the pace of increase is likely to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an recovery. In this situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Supported by the rise in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing, although the pace of increase is likely to decelerate as the materialization of pent-up demand slows In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to keep waning. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is projected to continue increasing. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase steadily. Meanwhile, public investment is likely to keep increasing moderately for the time being, partly due to the effects of large-scale projects. Thereafter, although these effects are projected to gradually dissipate, public investment is expected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19 and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with the The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increases led by the past rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately as the output gap improves and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. is significantly higher, mainly due to the fact that cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have been passed on to consumer prices to a greater extent than expected. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher electricity and gas charges are expected to push down the year-on-year For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are likely to push up the rate due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of change is projected to be at around 3 percent for fiscal 2023 and then be in the range of 1.5-2.0 percent for fiscal The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to turn positive around the middle of fiscal 2023 and expand moderately toward the end of the projection period, albeit at a gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have shown some upward movements again. that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has been at a high level, and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has also been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. In addition, the wage growth rate agreed in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations this year was significantly higher than in the previous year, including base pay. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. In this situation, signs of change have been seen in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Regarding the outlook, even as actual inflation decelerates, inflation expectations are likely to rise negotiations. This will likely lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to raise their policy interest rates. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow, albeit at a moderate pace. That said, vigilance against the risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases has remained high, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. With the continuing impact of policy interest rate hikes, there is also a risk that global financial conditions will tighten emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. Meanwhile, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets. The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the area, could heighten. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, there are extremely high uncertainties regarding the outlook, such as over geopolitical factors -- particularly the situation surrounding Ukraine -- and the effects of efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. It is expected in the baseline scenario that the terms of trade will improve, but if they were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income and lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward households. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. The third factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these changes, their medium- to long-term growth expectations, the potential growth rate, and the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, with Japan's economy following a recovery trend and against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by competitors, and these moves have continued to spread. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through to consumer prices could continue for longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario to a greater extent than can be explained by changes in the output gap, as moves to reflect not only price developments in wage setting but also wage developments in price setting become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with prices of commodities, including grains, declining on the whole, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could decline through the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation, and this could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although the wage growth rate agreed in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations this year was significantly higher than in the previous year, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected from next year and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to decelerate, with a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately. Although it will take time, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay on Japan's economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 and 2024. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, even in the markets, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain the stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in April 2023 Forecasts made in April 2023 Forecasts made in April 2023 Notes: 1.

It is also possible that will have a significant gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately for the time being, supported by the materialization of pent-up is expected to exert Although goods exports are projected to be affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies, they are likely to be more or less flat for the time being, due to factors such constraints. Thereafter, goods exports are likely to economies gradually picking up. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is projected to keep increasing as travel fixed is also expected to continue increasing, with corporate profits improving on the investment that had been postponed during the is likely to rise on the back of a recovery in growth is expected to accelerate as it gradually reflects the results of this year's annual spring show that the wage growth rate agreed in the negotiations was significantly higher than in the previous year, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, nominal employee income is likely to continue rising. Moreover, downward pressure on households' real income stemming from high prices is projected to ease gradually, since it is expected that the effects of pushing down energy will continue for the time being, and that there will be a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. In this situation, private consumption is projected to continue increasing moderately. This is because pent-up demand is to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a consumer sentiment, which mainly reflects a rise in wage growth, are expected to provide support. Government spending is expected to decline, reflecting a reduction in expenditure related to COVID-19, although it is likely to be supported by in construction related healthcare and nursing care expenditures. government's economic measures are likely to wane, Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies picking up and being maintained. Goods exports are likely to increase economies. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is also expected to continue increasing, including digital-related investment, investment related to investment associated with strengthening supply employee income is likely to continue increasing steadily. This is because wage growth is expected to remain relatively high, although it will gradually become more difficult for labor supply to increase, seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. In this situation, private consumption is likely to continue increasing moderately, although it is projected that a waning of the effects of the government's economic measures pushing down prices of the previous year will push down real demand will gradually wane. Government spending is expected to turn to a moderate related to building national resilience and an demand is expected to continue increasing, the growth pace of Japan's economy is likely to slow somewhat, mainly because pent-up demand is expected to diminish. Goods exports are likely to continuing to grow. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing.

With progress in construction based on the government's economic measures, including construction related to building national resilience, the amount of public construction completed -- a coincident indicator of public investment -- has increased. Recently, the effects of large-scale projects have also made a positive contribution. The value of public works contracted and orders received for public construction -- both of which are leading indicators of public investment -- saw have decreased somewhat. As for the outlook, public investment is likely to keep increasing moderately for the time being, Thereafter, although these effects are projected to gradually dissipate, public investment is expected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to continuing.

The mode is the inflation rate with the highest density in the price change distribution. The weighted median is the average of the inflation rates of the items at around the 50 percentile point of the cumulative distribution in terms of weight. All three indicators are calculated using data for each CPI item that excludes the effects of the consumption tax hikes, policies concerning the provision of free education, and travel subsidy programs. 13 In this report, the mode is defined as the inflation rate with the highest density in the distribution that is estimated parametrically by fitting a normal inverse Gaussian distribution to the observed price change distribution in each period. It should be noted that, of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been at around 3 percent recently. The weighted is developments in certain CPI items, has been at around 1.5 percent. Looking at the year-on-year the share of price-decreasing items has been at a high level as costs, such as of raw materials, have been passed on to a wide range of goods and domestic demand deflator has been in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent (Chart 35). By component, the private consumption deflator has been at around 3 percent on a year-on-year basis. The rates of increase in such deflators as for business fixed investment have remained at high levels despite slowing somewhat.

Starting from June 2023, the government has gradually lowered the gasoline subsidy rate applied when the nationwide average exceeds the benchmark by no more than 25 yen per liter, and will terminate the overall subsidies at the end of September.

As for fiscal 2025, the rate of increase in the CPI is projected to decelerate owing to dissipation of these effects. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2023 is higher. The projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 is somewhat higher, mainly because, while the government's economic measures will push down energy prices, cost increases have been passed on to consumer prices to a greater extent than expected. The projected rate of increase in this CPI for fiscal 2024 is significantly higher, mainly due to the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices and to a waning of the effects of the economic measures pushing down energy prices of the previous year. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced for fiscal 2023 and 2024 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023. In terms of prices, it should be noted that, mainly due to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in society. Considering this, it is important to closely monitor whether a virtuous cycle between wages and prices will intensify. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 30 and 31, 2023. Japan's economy has recovered moderately. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has improved moderately. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has increased steadily at a moderate pace, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is slower than a while ago, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures, but it has been in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent recently owing to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Inflation expectations have Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately for the time being, supported financial conditions and the government's economic measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a slowdown in the pace of recovery in measures are projected to wane, but Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2023 is higher. This reflects the actual data showing that the growth rate thus far has been higher than was previously projected, In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to keep increasing moderately for the time being. This is because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of sentiment, which mainly reflects the rise in wage growth, are expected to provide support. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned by the government's measures, such as those to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges. Thereafter, although private consumption is likely to be affected by a slowdown in the materialization of pent-up demand and a waning of the positive contribution of the government's various measures, it is expected to keep increasing moderately, supported by the rise in employee income. In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be more or less flat for the time being, affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies. Subsequently, as these economies grow moderately, albeit with variation across countries and regions, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend, as it is projected that they will be pushed up for the time being by factors such as progress in the pass-through of past high raw material costs to selling prices, and thereafter by a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue increasing, including investment to address labor shortages, digital-related investment, decarbonization, and investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase steadily. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19, and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with the The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024, mainly due to the remaining effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices and the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices. As for fiscal 2025, the rate of increase in the CPI is projected to decelerate owing to dissipation of these effects. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 is somewhat higher. This is mainly because, while the extension of the government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges will push down year-on-year CPI inflation, cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have been passed on to consumer prices to a greater extent than expected. The projected rate of increase in this CPI for fiscal 2024 is significantly higher. This is mainly due to the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices as well as to a waning of the effects of the extended measures pushing down year-on-year CPI inflation for fiscal The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges are expected to 2023. For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are projected to push up the rate due to a 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be at around 0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to decelerate, due to a gradual waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices, and subsequently be at around 2 percent toward the end of the projection period. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been at around 0 percent. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to turn positive and expand moderately toward the end of the projection period, albeit at a gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. The September 2023 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has been at a high level, and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has also been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to the wage growth rate agreed labor-management wage negotiations this year was significantly higher than in the previous year, including base pay. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. In this situation, some aspects of firms' behavior have begun to shift more toward raising wages and prices. Regarding the outlook, even as actual inflation decelerates, inflation expectations are expected to rise moderately toward the end of the projection period, with the output gap turning positive and changes in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior and in labor-management wage negotiations. This will likely lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage increases. Considering the above assessments, although it is necessary to pay attention to the extremely high uncertainties surrounding the outlook, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target. Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to conduct tight monetary policy. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow moderately, albeit with variation across countries and regions. That said, there is a risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, since the policy interest rate hikes by overseas central banks to date have been rapid, there are high uncertainties over how these hikes will affect their real economies and financial systems with a time lag. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to pay due Japan's economic activity and prices. Meanwhile, depending on the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine, downward pressure on overseas economies, particularly the euro area, could heighten. In addition, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets. The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, including grains. Although prices of grains and other commodities had declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, energy prices, such as for crude oil, have risen recently. Attention is warranted on the risk that prices of commodities, including grains, will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. If the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. Moreover, with progress in the pass-through of the rise in import prices to consumer prices, if wage increases were to be limited, this could further strengthen households' defensive attitudes toward spending and push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these changes, their medium- to long-term growth expectations, the potential growth rate, and the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, with Japan's economy following a recovery trend and against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by competitors. While a fair degree of progress seems to have already been made in the pass-through of the past rise in import prices to consumer prices, depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, this pass-through could continue for longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario to a greater extent than can be explained by changes in the output gap, as moves to reflect not only price developments in wage setting but also wage developments in price setting become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with inflation decelerating, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although the wage growth rate agreed in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations this year was significantly higher than in the previous year, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected from next year and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024 and then decelerate in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There are extremely high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced for fiscal 2023 and 2024 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023. In terms of prices, it should be noted that, mainly due to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in society. Considering this, it is important to closely monitor whether a virtuous cycle between wages and prices will intensify. Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the global financial markets, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain the stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in July 2023 Forecasts made in July 2023 Forecasts made in July 2023 Notes: 1.

The outlook is based on the premises that, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, these premises entail high uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 15 and 16, 2021. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase steadily. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have improved on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. Private consumption has been stagnant due to strong downward pressure on Housing investment has stopped declining. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food, and the same hereafter) has been at around 0 percent recently due to the rise in energy prices, despite being affected by COVID-19 and the reduction in mobile phone charges. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. Japan's economy is likely to recover, although the level of economic activity, mainly in the face-to-face services sector, is expected to be lower than that prior to the pandemic for the time being. That is, as the impact of COVID-19 wanes gradually, mainly due to progress with vaccinations, and the economy is supported by the increase in external demand, virtuous cycle from income to spending is expected to operate. Thereafter, as the impact subsides, the economy is projected to continue growing with the virtuous cycle This baseline scenario is based on the assumption that, while taking preventive measures against COVID-19 and improving economic activity simultaneously, the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually, mainly due to progress with vaccinations, and then almost subside in the middle of the projection period. The outlook also is based on the premises long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Looking at the outlook for economic activity based on the assumption and premises in more detail, as the impact of COVID-19 wanes due to progress with vaccinations, and regions, supported also by aggressive macroeconomic policies taken mainly in advanced economies. In this situation, Japan's goods exports are projected to continue increasing firmly, supported by an expansion in digital-related demand and a recovery in business fixed investment, both on a global basis. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry and travel restrictions continue but likely to recover thereafter. Corporate profits are projected to continue improving on the back of a recovery in domestic and external demand, despite being pushed down by deterioration in the terms of trade that reflects a recent rise in international commodity prices. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear, mainly for machinery investments, supported by construction investment by the face-to-face services sector is projected to remain weak for the time being. Although private consumption, mainly of face-to-face services, is likely to be at a relatively low level for the time being, it is expected to pick up again with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually and supported also by the government's economic measures. Thereafter, as the impact subsides, an uptrend in private consumption, including that of face-to-face services, is projected to become evident, supported also by improvement in employee income. Employee income is likely to turn to a pick-up with a time lag following the recovery in domestic and external demand, and then increase moderately. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is likely to increase clearly for fiscal 2021, mainly reflecting a and the medical treatment system, but see a lowering in its level thereafter. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be at around 0 percent in the short run.2 The reduction in mobile phone charges is projected to push down the CPI, whereas the rise in energy prices is likely to push it up. However, when excluding these temporary factors, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to be steady at a slightly 2 The CPI forecasts in this Outlook Report are based on the current 2015-base index. The statistics authority that compiles the CPI has announced its plan to rebase the CPI to the base year of 2020 and retroactively revise its figures for the year-on-year rate of change from those for January 2021 onward, both in August 2021. With the rebasing, the reduction in mobile phone charges will have a larger impact than the current index, mainly because the weight of such charges in the CPI will rise. Therefore, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is highly likely to be revised downward for the 2020-base index. positive level. Although weakness in demand amid the situation of COVID-19 is projected to have an impact on prices, it is likely that firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand will still not be observed widely, given that one of the reasons for the decrease in demand is vigilance against COVID-19 and that there have been cost increases because of taking Thereafter, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to increase gradually, energy prices for the time being, and the dissipation of the effects of the reduction in mobile phone charges. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations, which have been more or less unchanged, also are expected to rise again as firms' price-setting stance gradually becomes active with the impact of COVID-19 subsiding. Curve Control. It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March 2020 in response to the impact of COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. The government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms. Private financial institutions have actively fulfilled the functioning of financial intermediation. In this situation, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen, the environment for has remained accommodative. Owing to the continuation of powerful monetary easing by the Bank, the government's measures, and efforts made by private financial institutions, the Bank considers that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.3 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. The consequences of COVID-19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies entail high uncertainties. There is a risk that downward pressure on Japan's economy will increase due to the spread of COVID-19, including variants. On the other hand, if, for 3 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. materializes relatively early, economic activity could improve by more than expected. The pace of recovery in overseas economies could also change depending on progress with the vaccine rollout and the course COVID-19 takes, including the spread of variants, in countries and regions around the world. In addition, international commodity prices have risen against the background of the global economy recovering from the depression triggered by the impact of COVID-19, and attention should be paid to developments in The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the impact of COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection, an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, and efforts to address climate change issues have positive effects on economic activity, such as further innovation. These developments are likely to be encouraged by The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although COVID-19 has affected the financial side as well, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation has been ensured. However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is uncertainties over firms' price-setting behavior, including those over the impact of COVID-19 on their behavior. In the baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, as described earlier, it is projected that firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand will still not be observed widely and that their price-setting stance will gradually become active with the impact of COVID-19 subsiding. That said, firms' price-setting behavior in the future entails uncertainties given, for example, that the entrenched mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation in Japan is complex and sticky. The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates, international commodity These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Thus, attention should continue to be paid to them, including the extent to which cost increases are passed on to prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. In other words, prices are expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that upward pressure on them will intensify at a gradual pace with the economy continuing to improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations also will rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is highly unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the premises that, growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, these premises entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. Looking at the current situation from the economy has been increasing at a pace significantly above the past trend. This is because financial institutions have responded to demand for working capital, mainly by firms, which has increased due to the impact of COVID-19, and the increase in the aggregate credit therefore does not seem to show overheating of financial activities. On this basis, when examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Although exports are projected to continue showing some weakness for the time being, they are expected to be on a moderate increasing trend, with overseas economies growing moderately on the whole. Domestic demand also is likely to follow an uptrend, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and the underpinnings through government spending, despite being affected by such factors as the consumption tax hike. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising throughout the projection period, despite such effects as of the decline in crude oil prices for the time being. \uf06c Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected growth rates are somewhat lower due to the delay in the timing of a pick-up in the growth pace of overseas economies.

Risks to prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the downside risks to economic activity and uncertainties over developments in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. The momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is maintained but is not yet sufficiently firm, and thus developments in prices continue to warrant careful attention. 1 The text of \"The Bank's View\" -- the outlook for economic activity and prices as well as the Bank's thinking on the conduct of monetary policy, both of which are based on individual Policy Board members' views -- was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 30 and 31, 2019. Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from have continued to be affected by the slowdown in overseas economies. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have continued to be observed. In this situation, exports have continued to show some weakness. On the other hand, with corporate profits staying at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations due to such effects as of the and income situation. Housing investment and public investment have been more or less flat. Although exports have continued to show some weakness, industrial production also has been more or less flat, reflecting the increase in domestic demand, and labor market conditions have remained financial conditions are highly less fresh food, and the same hereafter) is in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend throughout the projection period -- that is, through fiscal 2021 -- as the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited, although the economy is likely to continue to be affected by the slowdown for the time being. As for overseas economies, the timing of a pick-up in the growth pace is likely to be delayed for longer than expected. Thus, exports are projected to continue showing some weakness for the time being. However, overseas economies are expected to grow moderately on the whole with the growth rates rising, partly backed by the materialization adjustments in IT-related goods. Under these circumstances, Japan's exports are projected to return to their moderate increasing trend. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, mainly against through government spending. Business fixed investment -- mainly investment related to research and development (R&D) investment for growth areas -- is likely to continue increasing moderately amid accommodative financial conditions, although the pace of increase is expected to decelerate temporarily, mainly for manufacturing, due to the capital stock are projected to exert downward pressure from a somewhat longer-term perspective. Private consumption is expected to follow a moderate increasing trend as the employment and income situation continues to improve, although it is likely to be pushed down temporarily due to the effects of the consumption tax hike.2 Meanwhile, government is expected to continue increasing reflecting expansion in expenditure such as for national resilience, and thereafter remain at a relatively high level. Thus, the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited. On this basis, Japan's economy is expected to grow temporarily at a somewhat slower pace than its potential, but moderately accelerate its growth pace thereafter.3 Thus, the economy is likely to continue growing at about the same pace as its potential on average. Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected growth rates are Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, short- and long-term real interest rates are assumed to be in negative territory throughout the projection period as the Bank pursues \"Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control.\"4 Financial institutions' active lending attitudes, as well as favorable conditions for corporate bond and CP issuance, are likely to be maintained conditions are likely to remain highly accommodative. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to follow a moderate uptrend throughout the projection period against the backdrop of the following continuing developments: progress in implementation of the government's growth strategy, including regulatory and 2 The consumption tax hike conducted in October 2019 is likely to affect the GDP growth rates through the following two channels: (1) fluctuations in demand prior to and after the hike and (2) a decline in real income. However, the impact on the growth rates is expected to be smaller than that of the previous tax hike in fiscal 2014, although it is subject to uncertainties, mainly because the government implemented various measures and the increase in demand prior to the hike was limited this time. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent recently. However, the estimate of the potential growth rate varies depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. Thus, it should be regarded as being subject to a considerable margin of error. 4 Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding future policy. strategy; and firms' fixed investment and efforts toward improving productivity. In addition, Japan's economy, monetary easing effects are likely to be enhanced. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been positive but has continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and tight labor This is basically because firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance, as well as households' cautiousness toward price rises, have not yet clearly changed in a situation where the mindset and behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched. Firms' efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs by raising productivity, the technological progress in recent years, and the high wage elasticity of labor supply also are contributing factors. In addition, the continued lackluster developments in administered prices and housing rent are likely to have affected the sluggishness in prices. It has been taking time to resolve these factors that have been delaying price rises, and the situation likely has continued in which the responsiveness of prices to the output gap, as well as inflation expectations that are strongly affected by the adaptive formation mechanism, do not rise easily. With regard to the outlook, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising throughout the projection period, despite such effects as of the decline in crude oil prices for the time being. Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected rates of increase in the CPI are lower, mainly for the first half of the projection period, reflecting such factors as the decline in crude oil prices.5 gradually toward 2 percent can be explained by the following factors that determine general price inflation. First, the output gap -- which shows the utilization of labor and capital -- has been substantially positive, reflecting tight labor market conditions and high levels of capital utilization rates. Regarding the outlook, although it is likely to narrow for 5 Assuming that the rise in the consumption tax is fully passed on to prices of taxable items, excluding those to which a reduced tax rate is applied, the effect of the October 2019 tax hike on the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for October 2019 onward is estimated to be 1.0 percentage point; the effects for fiscal 2019 and 2020 are estimated to be 0.5 percentage point for each fiscal year. In addition, based on a specific assumption using information available at this point, the effects of policies concerning the provision of free education on the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2019 and 2020 are estimated to be minus 0.3 percentage point and minus 0.4 percentage point, respectively. consumption tax hike, it is expected to remain at around the current level on average with the economy continuing on an expanding trend. Under such circumstances, further price rises are likely to be observed widely as households' tolerance of price rises increases, mainly reflecting a rise in wage growth rates, and firms' stance shifts toward further raising Second, medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently. As for the outlook, such expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend and component, a rise in the observed inflation rate is likely to push up inflation expectations, and (2) in terms of the forward-looking component, the Bank will pursue monetary easing through its strong commitment to achieving the price stability target, which will be effective in pushing up inflation expectations.6 Third, regarding import prices, the past decline in crude oil prices is likely to push down the CPI substantially through the fall in energy prices for the time being. However, such downward pressure is projected to diminish gradually thereafter. strengthening of efforts toward improving productivity, are expected to increase upward pressure on prices in the long term. Specifically, as the growth potential of the economy as a whole rises, reflecting such moves, firms' and households' spending behavior can be expected to become active. The following four factors are upside and downside risks to the Bank's baseline scenario regarding the economy. The first is developments in overseas economies. Specifically, the following are considered as risks: the consequences of protectionist moves and their effects; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies such as China; concerning overseas economies seem to be increasing, and it also is necessary to pay 6 Medium- to long-term inflation expectations can be regarded as consisting of two components: a forward-looking component, in which inflation expectations converge to the price stability target set by the central bank, and a backward-looking, or adaptive, component that reflects the observed inflation rate. For details, see the Bank's Comprehensive Assessment: Developments in Economic Activity and Prices as well as Policy Effects since the Introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) released in September 2016. The second risk is the effects of the consumption tax hike conducted in October 2019. The increase in demand prior to the tax hike has been small this time compared with that of the previous tax hike. However, the effects of the tax hike continue to warrant attention as they are likely to depend on consumer sentiment, the employment and income Third, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations may be either raised or lowered depending on the following: efforts to address medium- to long-term issues such as the declining birthrate and aging population; developments in regulatory declines, the economy may deviate downward from the baseline scenario through increasing concerns regarding the future and the rises in long-term interest rates associated with them. On the other hand, there also is a possibility that the economy will deviate upward from the baseline scenario if confidence in the path toward fiscal consolidation strengthens and concerns regarding the future are alleviated. As mentioned above, with regard to risks to economic activity, the downside risks concerning overseas economies in particular seem to be increasing. If these risks materialize, close attention should be paid to the possibility that prices also will be affected In addition, the specific factors that could exert upside and downside risks to prices are as follows. The first is developments in firms' and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Although inflation expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend, there is a risk that a rise in such expectations will be delayed through the adaptive formation mechanism if it takes longer than projected for firms' stance to shift toward further raising wages and prices and actual inflation consequently remains relatively sluggish. The second factor is the responsiveness of prices to the output gap. If firms' efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs by raising productivity continue for a long time, or stemming from these factors may last longer than expected. In addition, the lackluster developments in administered prices and housing rent also may continue to constrain the Third, developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices going forward, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices, may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the future conduct of monetary policy.7 The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent. Although it is necessary to carefully examine the risks to economic activity and prices, the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent appears to be maintained. This is because (1) firms' stance is expected to gradually shift toward further raising wages and prices with the output gap remaining positive, and (2) medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged and are projected to rise gradually as further price rises come to be observed widely. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. With regard to the outlook for economic activity, risks are skewed to the downside, particularly regarding developments in overseas economies. Regarding the outlook for prices, risks are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the long-term inflation expectations. Examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, there is no sign so far of excessively bullish expectations in asset markets or in the activities of financial institutions. However, prolonged downward pressure on among financial institutions continuing, could create risks of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation and of destabilizing the financial system. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.8 As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary 7 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" 8 For details, see the Bank's Financial System Report (October 2019). exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for the policy rates, the Bank expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. It will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. In particular, in a situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies, are significant, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.

Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat. Industrial production has been more or less flat as a trend, but it has declined recently, Corporate profits have improved and business sentiment has stayed at a favorable level. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has been resilient, although the impact of price rises and developments such as a decline in automobile sales due to the suspension of shipment at some automakers have been observed. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been at around 2.5 percent recently, as services prices have continued to rise moderately, reflecting factors cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have waned. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies growing moderately and as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies against the background of factors such as accommodative Comparing the projections through fiscal 2025 with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2023 is lower, mainly reflecting lower private consumption due in part to the effects of the suspension of production and shipment at some automakers. The projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat lower, given that the GDP growth rate for the second half of fiscal 2023 is expected to be fairly lower than previously projected. The rate for fiscal 2025 is more or In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Against this backdrop, for the time being, although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to increase moderately, mainly reflecting the rise in wage growth and improvement in consumer sentiment. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned by the government's initiatives, such as the continuation of measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices and also cuts in income tax and In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend, mainly due to a pick-up in global demand for IT-related goods, as overseas economies grow moderately. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend with a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat. Government consumption is expected to increase moderately in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, the rate of increase is projected to be 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. pushed up through fiscal 2025 by the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices and a waning of the effects of the government's economic measures pushing down CPI inflation. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the Comparing the projections through fiscal 2025 with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 is higher, mainly due to the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices, but that for fiscal 2025 is more or less unchanged. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges had pushed down 2023. For fiscal 2024 and 2025, the phasing out of these measures is projected to push up the rates. Looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to decelerate, due to a gradual waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices, and subsequently be at around 2 percent. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend, albeit with fluctuations. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to widen moderately within positive territory toward the end of the projection period. Meanwhile, labor market conditions are expected to tighten to a greater extent than can be explained by the changes in the output gap, partly due to a deceleration in the on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. The March 2024 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that figures for firms' inflation outlook for general prices have been at high levels. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and it is highly likely that firm wage increases that are higher than those seen in the previous year will be achieved in this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations. In addition, moves to reflect wage increases in selling prices have been strengthening. Regarding the outlook, inflation expectations are expected to rise moderately, with behavior. Under these circumstances, the virtuous cycle between wages and prices is projected to keep intensifying through achievement of wage increases that reflect price rises and through a pass-through of wage increases to selling prices. Considering the above assessments, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, mainly reflecting the improvement in the output gap and the rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations; in the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. That said, there remain uncertainties regarding this outlook, and it is necessary to carefully monitor factors such Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Inflation rates in the United States and Europe have followed a declining trend, albeit with fluctuations, and overseas central banks have apparently signaled future policy interest rate reductions. That said, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis and, in the case where inflation rates stay elevated through wage increases and other factors, there is a risk of tight monetary policy being prolonged. Moreover, since the policy interest rate hikes by overseas central banks to date have been rapid, there are uncertainties over how these hikes will affect their real economies and financial systems with a time lag. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. Meanwhile, depending on factors such as the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine and the Middle East, downward pressure on overseas economies could heighten. In addition, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets, and it is necessary to pay attention to how inventory adjustment pressure on some goods will affect overseas The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, other commodities will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. If the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. Moreover, with progress in the pass-through of the rise in import strengthen further, and this could push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is the impact of various changes in the environment surrounding Japan on firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations and on Japan's potential growth rate. It is expected that factors such as the experience of COVID-19, intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization and on labor market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Intensifying labor shortages -- which are partly due to demographic changes -- could accelerate labor-saving investment, such as for digitalization. On the other hand, if such a substitution of labor with capital does not sufficiently progress, there is a risk that supply-side constraints in some industries will push down the growth rate. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. Relatively high wage increases are likely to be achieved in this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, in view of factors such as the need to recruit and retain employees, with labor market conditions tightening. While moves to reflect price developments in wages have been strengthening, there remain uncertainties over the extent to which moves to reflect wage developments in selling prices will become widespread. It is expected in the baseline scenario that the virtuous cycle between wages and prices will continue to intensify. However, given that many firms, especially small and medium-sized firms, have reported that it has been difficult to pass on their employees' higher wages to their selling prices, the rise in selling prices could be limited. Since the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in Japanese society for a prolonged period, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether moves to pass on increases in wages and other costs to selling prices will weaken with the waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. On the other hand, moves to reflect wages in selling prices could strengthen to a greater extent than expected, and upward pressure on wages could intensify with labor market conditions tightening. In this situation, there is also a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario, accompanied The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including future developments in global inflation rates and possible fluctuations in foreign exchange markets, how these factors will affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with the virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There remain high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced for fiscal 2024 onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2024 but are generally balanced thereafter. Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has generally not been seen in asset prices was seen for a time and valuations of some properties seem to have been relatively high in the real estate market. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the abroad and in global financial markets, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. Moreover, financial institutions' resilience to rises in yen interest rates has headed toward improvement, mainly reflecting their portfolio rebalancing in securities investment. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, it will depend on future developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. Uncertainties surrounding these economic and financial developments at home and abroad remain high. If the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized and underlying inflation will increase, the Bank will adjust the degree of monetary accommodation, while it anticipates that accommodative financial conditions will be maintained for the time being.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024, mainly due to the remaining effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices and the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices. As for fiscal 2025, the rate of increase in the CPI is projected to decelerate owing to dissipation of these effects. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2023 is higher. The projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 is somewhat higher, mainly because, while the government's economic measures will push down energy prices, cost increases have been passed on to consumer prices to a greater extent than expected. The projected rate of increase in this CPI for fiscal 2024 is significantly higher, mainly due to the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices and to a waning of the effects of the economic measures pushing down energy prices of the previous year. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced for fiscal 2023 and 2024 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023. In terms of prices, it should be noted that, mainly due to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in society. Considering this, it is important to closely monitor whether a virtuous cycle between wages and prices will intensify. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 30 and 31, 2023. Japan's economy has recovered moderately. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has improved moderately. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has increased steadily at a moderate pace, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is slower than a while ago, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures, but it has been in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent recently owing to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Inflation expectations have Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately for the time being, supported financial conditions and the government's economic measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a slowdown in the pace of recovery in measures are projected to wane, but Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2023 is higher. This reflects the actual data showing that the growth rate thus far has been higher than was previously projected, In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to keep increasing moderately for the time being. This is because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of sentiment, which mainly reflects the rise in wage growth, are expected to provide support. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned by the government's measures, such as those to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges. Thereafter, although private consumption is likely to be affected by a slowdown in the materialization of pent-up demand and a waning of the positive contribution of the government's various measures, it is expected to keep increasing moderately, supported by the rise in employee income. In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be more or less flat for the time being, affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies. Subsequently, as these economies grow moderately, albeit with variation across countries and regions, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend, as it is projected that they will be pushed up for the time being by factors such as progress in the pass-through of past high raw material costs to selling prices, and thereafter by a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue increasing, including investment to address labor shortages, digital-related investment, decarbonization, and investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase steadily. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19, and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with the The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024, mainly due to the remaining effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices and the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices. As for fiscal 2025, the rate of increase in the CPI is projected to decelerate owing to dissipation of these effects. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 is somewhat higher. This is mainly because, while the extension of the government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges will push down year-on-year CPI inflation, cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have been passed on to consumer prices to a greater extent than expected. The projected rate of increase in this CPI for fiscal 2024 is significantly higher. This is mainly due to the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices as well as to a waning of the effects of the extended measures pushing down year-on-year CPI inflation for fiscal The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges are expected to 2023. For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are projected to push up the rate due to a 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be at around 0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to decelerate, due to a gradual waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices, and subsequently be at around 2 percent toward the end of the projection period. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been at around 0 percent. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to turn positive and expand moderately toward the end of the projection period, albeit at a gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. The September 2023 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has been at a high level, and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has also been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to the wage growth rate agreed labor-management wage negotiations this year was significantly higher than in the previous year, including base pay. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. In this situation, some aspects of firms' behavior have begun to shift more toward raising wages and prices. Regarding the outlook, even as actual inflation decelerates, inflation expectations are expected to rise moderately toward the end of the projection period, with the output gap turning positive and changes in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior and in labor-management wage negotiations. This will likely lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage increases. Considering the above assessments, although it is necessary to pay attention to the extremely high uncertainties surrounding the outlook, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target. Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to conduct tight monetary policy. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow moderately, albeit with variation across countries and regions. That said, there is a risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, since the policy interest rate hikes by overseas central banks to date have been rapid, there are high uncertainties over how these hikes will affect their real economies and financial systems with a time lag. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to pay due Japan's economic activity and prices. Meanwhile, depending on the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine, downward pressure on overseas economies, particularly the euro area, could heighten. In addition, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets. The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, including grains. Although prices of grains and other commodities had declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, energy prices, such as for crude oil, have risen recently. Attention is warranted on the risk that prices of commodities, including grains, will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. If the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. Moreover, with progress in the pass-through of the rise in import prices to consumer prices, if wage increases were to be limited, this could further strengthen households' defensive attitudes toward spending and push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these changes, their medium- to long-term growth expectations, the potential growth rate, and the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, with Japan's economy following a recovery trend and against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by competitors. While a fair degree of progress seems to have already been made in the pass-through of the past rise in import prices to consumer prices, depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, this pass-through could continue for longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario to a greater extent than can be explained by changes in the output gap, as moves to reflect not only price developments in wage setting but also wage developments in price setting become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with inflation decelerating, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although the wage growth rate agreed in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations this year was significantly higher than in the previous year, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected from next year and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024 and then decelerate in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There are extremely high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced for fiscal 2023 and 2024 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023. In terms of prices, it should be noted that, mainly due to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in society. Considering this, it is important to closely monitor whether a virtuous cycle between wages and prices will intensify. Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the global financial markets, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain the stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in July 2023 Forecasts made in July 2023 Forecasts made in July 2023 Notes: 1.

In sum, although Japan's economy has been affected by the slowdown in virtuous cycle from income to spending has been Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately for the time being, supported by the measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from the slowdown economic measures are projected to wane, but Japan's economy is expected to continue growing intensifies in the overall economy. Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous rate for fiscal 2023 is higher.

This is productivity (TFP) has increased slightly, working hours have continued on a downtrend, reflecting has decelerated as a result of past declines in business fixed investment. As for the outlook, the is expected moderately. This is based on the projection that, although there will be less room for the number of employed persons to increase, (1) the TFP growth rate will increase moderately, mainly on resulting improvement in efficiency of resource in human capital, (2) the decline in working hours will come to a halt in reflection of the diminishing 7 The government formulated the Comprehensive Economic Measures for Overcoming Price Increases and Revitalizing the Economy in October 2022 and additional measures toward overcoming price increases in March 2023.

It is also possible that will have a significant gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In the second half of fiscal 2023, Japan's is to continue recovering moderately, supported by the materialization of is expected to exert exports are projected to be more or less flat for the time being with the pace of recovery in overseas economies remaining slow. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to keep increasing. With corporate profits improving on the whole, business fixed investment is also projected to continue increasing, mainly on the back of household sector, employment is likely to rise on wage growth is expected to remain relatively high. Due to these factors, nominal employee income is to keep rising. Moreover, downward pressure on households' real income stemming from high prices is expected to ease. This is because the effects of pushing down energy are projected to continue, although they will likely diminish, and because it is expected that there will be a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Against this backdrop, is projected to keep increasing moderately. This is because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a consumer sentiment, which mainly reflects a rise in wage growth, are expected to provide support. Government spending is expected to decline, reflecting a reduction in expenditure related to COVID-19, although it is likely to be supported by in construction related healthcare and nursing care expenditures. government's economic measures are likely to wane, Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies growing moderately and accommodative financial conditions being maintained. As overseas economies grow and regions, goods exports are likely to see a moderate increase. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed is also expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor related to growth areas and decarbonization, and investment associated with strengthening supply employee income is likely to continue increasing steadily. This is because wage growth is expected to remain relatively high, although it will gradually become more difficult for labor supply to increase, seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. In this situation, private consumption is likely to continue increasing moderately, although it is projected that a waning of the effects of the government's economic measures pushing down prices of the previous year will push down real demand will gradually wane. Government spending is expected to turn to a moderate related to building national resilience and an In fiscal 2025, although pent-up demand is expected to diminish, domestic and external demand is projected to continue increasing. Goods exports are likely to increase moderately, with overseas economies continuing to grow. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is also expected to continue increasing, mainly to address decarbonization; however, the pace of increase is projected to slow somewhat, partly because it is likely to be pushed down by adjustment pressure on capital stock. Although pent-up demand is to diminish, private consumption is projected to continue increasing moderately, with income situation continuing improve, supported by wage is expected to keep increasing healthcare and nursing care expenditures. investment has increased moderately (Chart 4). With progress in construction based on the government's economic measures, including construction related to building national resilience, the amount of public construction completed -- a coincident indicator of public investment -- has been on an uptrend.

The government's economic measures decided by the Cabinet in October 2022 also include efforts to implement the acceleration measures. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed (Chart 5). By region, the U.S. economy has been firm, mainly led by private consumption, although it has been affected by policy interest rate hikes.

After gradually reducing the subsidies from January 2023, the government revised the measure and expanded the subsidies in early September, in response to crude oil prices rising again. With regard to electricity charges, through its measures to reduce the household burden, electricity charges were cut by 7 yen per kilowatt-hour (roughly a 20 percent discount per month for typical households) for the period from February through September 2023, and have been cut by 3.5 yen per kilowatt-hour since October. Regarding manufactured and piped gas charges, roughly similar measures to reduce the household burden have been introduced. In the provisional economic measures that the government is currently formulating, it has announced its policy to continue with the above measures to reduce the household burden until next spring. 20-100102030405060181920212223 FD index (excluding exports)Chart 45:FD-ID Price Indexes (All Commodities)Source: Bank of Japan.CY2015=100CY 20-100102030405060181920212223 Contract currency basisChart 44:Import Price Indexy/y % chg.CYSource: Bankof Japan. charges have accelerated in reflection of the past measures to reduce the household burden of energy prices is likely to be negative for the time being.

Labor shortages have been evident especially among workers who are younger or highly skilled. Driven job market for regular employees, who were considered to have low mobility and to be recruited and retained without putting high pressure on firms to raise wages, has expanded Such intensifying labor shortages have been spreading even to firms that are considered to have advantages workers -- which seem to include many leader firms -- and it is likely that this has resulted in these firms shifting their wage-setting behavior more toward raising wages. In fact, an analysis of microdata from the Tankan surveys indicates that labor shortages have recently intensified rapidly, including among firms that did not experience market conditions became tight (Chart B1-5). 19 For example, a survey released by Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd. in August 2023 and the LOBO survey (May 2023), which is conducted by the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry -- both of which mainly cover SMEs -- show that the percentage of firms that raised or would raise base pay went up significantly from last year.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023, with a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately, albeit with fluctuations, as the output gap improves and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as firms' price- and wage-setting behavior. \uf06c Comparing the projections through fiscal 2024 with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rates for fiscal 2022 and 2023 are lower, mainly due to a lower projection for private consumption, but the projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is more or less unchanged. The projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 and 2024 are somewhat higher, mainly due to a higher projection for wages. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices as well as developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on April 27 and 28, 2023. Japan's economy has picked up, despite being affected by factors such as past high commodity prices. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has been more or less unchanged. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole. Private consumption has increased moderately, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some fresh food) is slower than a while ago, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures, but it has been at around 3 percent recently owing to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently after rising. Toward around the middle of fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is likely to recover moderately, supported by the materialization of pent-up demand, as well as by factors such as it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from past high commodity prices In the household sector, regarding the employment situation, the number of both regular and non-regular employees is likely to rise on the back of improvement in economic activity. In addition, wage growth is expected to increase, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be affected by price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately. This is mainly because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions. Private consumption is also likely to be underpinned by the government's measures such as those to reduce the In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies resulting mainly from the impact they are likely to be more or less flat due to factors such as a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Although past high raw material costs are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at continued improvement in economic activity. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support and the effects of supply-side constraints wane, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor investment associated with strengthening supply chains. From the second half of fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at gradually intensifies in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period due to a waning of the In the household sector, employment is projected to continue increasing, but the pace of increase is likely to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an recovery. In this situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Supported by the increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing, although the pace of increase is likely to decelerate as the materialization of pent-up demand slows and the positive contribution of the government's various measures wanes. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is projected to continue increasing. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase steadily. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat throughout the projection period, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19 and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with an The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) had been increasing led by the rise in import prices. However, the rate of increase has decelerated recently, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures. Since international commodity prices are lower than a while ago and the year-on-year rate of increase in the import price index has decelerated, it is projected that there will be a waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the rise in import prices. For this reason, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is highly likely to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately, albeit with 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as firms' The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges are expected to for the first half of fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are likely to push up the rate due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of change is projected to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2023 and then be in the range of The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to turn positive around the middle of fiscal 2023 and expand moderately toward the end of the projection period, albeit at a gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently after rising moderately. The March 2023 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has been at a high level, and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has also been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. With regard to the annual compiled by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) show that the wage growth rate agreed in the negotiations thus far has been significantly higher than in the previous year, including base pay. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Regarding the outlook, even as actual inflation decelerates toward the middle of fiscal 2023, inflation expectations are likely to rise again moderately toward the end of the projection period, behavior and in labor-management wage negotiations. This will likely lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage increases. Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to raise their policy interest rates. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow, albeit at a moderate pace. That said, vigilance against the risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases has remained high, mainly in advanced economies. In this situation, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. In addition, there was a phase when market participants' risk sentiment deteriorated, mainly due to the effects of issues surrounding some financial institutions in the United States and Europe. With central banks continuing to make policy interest rate hikes, there is also a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further, mainly through adjustments in asset prices, fluctuations in outflows from emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign regarding China, where the resumption of economic activity has progressed rapidly, there are high uncertainties over the pace of materialization of pent-up demand in terms of both The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the area, could heighten. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, there are extremely high uncertainties regarding the outlook, such as over geopolitical factors -- particularly the situation surrounding Ukraine -- and the effects of efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase households' real income, and this could lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. The third factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by competitors. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through to consumer prices could continue longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario as moves to reflect not only price developments in wage setting but also wage developments in price setting become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with prices of commodities, including grains, declining on the whole, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could decline through the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation and this could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although a wage growth rate that is significantly higher than in the previous year is likely to be achieved as a result of this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected from next year and prices will deviate The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been above 2 percent. The rate of increase, however, is expected to decelerate to a level below 2 percent toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Although it will take time, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices as well as developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, including the effects of the recent issues surrounding some financial institutions in the United States and Europe, the financial system is likely to remain highly 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in January 2023 Forecasts made in January 2023 Forecasts made in January 2023 Notes: 1.

The outlook is based on the premises that, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, these premises entail high uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 15 and 16, 2021. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase steadily. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have improved on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. Private consumption has been stagnant due to strong downward pressure on Housing investment has stopped declining. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food, and the same hereafter) has been at around 0 percent recently due to the rise in energy prices, despite being affected by COVID-19 and the reduction in mobile phone charges. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. Japan's economy is likely to recover, although the level of economic activity, mainly in the face-to-face services sector, is expected to be lower than that prior to the pandemic for the time being. That is, as the impact of COVID-19 wanes gradually, mainly due to progress with vaccinations, and the economy is supported by the increase in external demand, virtuous cycle from income to spending is expected to operate. Thereafter, as the impact subsides, the economy is projected to continue growing with the virtuous cycle This baseline scenario is based on the assumption that, while taking preventive measures against COVID-19 and improving economic activity simultaneously, the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually, mainly due to progress with vaccinations, and then almost subside in the middle of the projection period. The outlook also is based on the premises long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Looking at the outlook for economic activity based on the assumption and premises in more detail, as the impact of COVID-19 wanes due to progress with vaccinations, and regions, supported also by aggressive macroeconomic policies taken mainly in advanced economies. In this situation, Japan's goods exports are projected to continue increasing firmly, supported by an expansion in digital-related demand and a recovery in business fixed investment, both on a global basis. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry and travel restrictions continue but likely to recover thereafter. Corporate profits are projected to continue improving on the back of a recovery in domestic and external demand, despite being pushed down by deterioration in the terms of trade that reflects a recent rise in international commodity prices. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear, mainly for machinery investments, supported by construction investment by the face-to-face services sector is projected to remain weak for the time being. Although private consumption, mainly of face-to-face services, is likely to be at a relatively low level for the time being, it is expected to pick up again with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually and supported also by the government's economic measures. Thereafter, as the impact subsides, an uptrend in private consumption, including that of face-to-face services, is projected to become evident, supported also by improvement in employee income. Employee income is likely to turn to a pick-up with a time lag following the recovery in domestic and external demand, and then increase moderately. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is likely to increase clearly for fiscal 2021, mainly reflecting a and the medical treatment system, but see a lowering in its level thereafter. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be at around 0 percent in the short run.2 The reduction in mobile phone charges is projected to push down the CPI, whereas the rise in energy prices is likely to push it up. However, when excluding these temporary factors, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to be steady at a slightly 2 The CPI forecasts in this Outlook Report are based on the current 2015-base index. The statistics authority that compiles the CPI has announced its plan to rebase the CPI to the base year of 2020 and retroactively revise its figures for the year-on-year rate of change from those for January 2021 onward, both in August 2021. With the rebasing, the reduction in mobile phone charges will have a larger impact than the current index, mainly because the weight of such charges in the CPI will rise. Therefore, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is highly likely to be revised downward for the 2020-base index. positive level. Although weakness in demand amid the situation of COVID-19 is projected to have an impact on prices, it is likely that firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand will still not be observed widely, given that one of the reasons for the decrease in demand is vigilance against COVID-19 and that there have been cost increases because of taking Thereafter, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to increase gradually, energy prices for the time being, and the dissipation of the effects of the reduction in mobile phone charges. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations, which have been more or less unchanged, also are expected to rise again as firms' price-setting stance gradually becomes active with the impact of COVID-19 subsiding. Curve Control. It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March 2020 in response to the impact of COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. The government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms. Private financial institutions have actively fulfilled the functioning of financial intermediation. In this situation, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen, the environment for has remained accommodative. Owing to the continuation of powerful monetary easing by the Bank, the government's measures, and efforts made by private financial institutions, the Bank considers that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.3 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. The consequences of COVID-19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies entail high uncertainties. There is a risk that downward pressure on Japan's economy will increase due to the spread of COVID-19, including variants. On the other hand, if, for 3 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. materializes relatively early, economic activity could improve by more than expected. The pace of recovery in overseas economies could also change depending on progress with the vaccine rollout and the course COVID-19 takes, including the spread of variants, in countries and regions around the world. In addition, international commodity prices have risen against the background of the global economy recovering from the depression triggered by the impact of COVID-19, and attention should be paid to developments in The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the impact of COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection, an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, and efforts to address climate change issues have positive effects on economic activity, such as further innovation. These developments are likely to be encouraged by The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although COVID-19 has affected the financial side as well, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation has been ensured. However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is uncertainties over firms' price-setting behavior, including those over the impact of COVID-19 on their behavior. In the baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, as described earlier, it is projected that firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand will still not be observed widely and that their price-setting stance will gradually become active with the impact of COVID-19 subsiding. That said, firms' price-setting behavior in the future entails uncertainties given, for example, that the entrenched mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation in Japan is complex and sticky. The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates, international commodity These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Thus, attention should continue to be paid to them, including the extent to which cost increases are passed on to prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. In other words, prices are expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that upward pressure on them will intensify at a gradual pace with the economy continuing to improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations also will rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is highly unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the premises that, growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, these premises entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. Looking at the current situation from the economy has been increasing at a pace significantly above the past trend. This is because financial institutions have responded to demand for working capital, mainly by firms, which has increased due to the impact of COVID-19, and the increase in the aggregate credit therefore does not seem to show overheating of financial activities. On this basis, when examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

The implementation of the third supplementary budget for fiscal 2020 and the initial budget for fiscal 2021 based on the aforementioned measures is expected to support economic activity, mainly through increases in public investment and government consumption. the Cabinet decided on of economic activity is expected to be further evident, including in the face-to-face services goods exports are projected to continue increasing firmly, supported by the expansion in business fixed investment, both on a global basis, policies continuing to be conducted, mainly in exports is also likely to be supported by a pick-up in automobile-related goods, mainly reflecting a demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry and travel restrictions continue but likely to vaccinations progress around the world and such restrictions are lifted. Private consumption, mainly of face-to-face services, is likely to be at a low level while public health measures remain in to progress with vaccinations in Japan, it is expected to pick up again, supported also by activities mostly become unconstrained by mainly of services, is projected to become evident income is likely to turn to a pick-up with a time lag following the recovery in domestic and external remaining is projected to increase moderately toward the second half of the projection period. An uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become investments, supported by the face-to-face services industry is projected to remain weak for the time being. Meanwhile, public investment is likely to steadily increase, reflecting such progress as in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience, which is included in the government's additional economic measures formulated at the end of 2020. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is projected to increase clearly for fiscal 2021, reflecting a pick-up in healthcare expenditure, however, government consumption is projected to see a lowering in its level since expenditure related to COVID-19 is likely to decrease. Reflecting these developments in demand both at is expected to mark a relatively large positive waning gradually and supported by an increase in measures. The rate is projected to continue to to progress with vaccinations. The rate for fiscal 2023 is expected to continue growing at a pace increasing being maintained, although is Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected growth rate for fiscal 2021 is somewhat lower due 2-10123458590950005101520 Potential growth rateChart 6:Potential Growth Ratey/y % chg.FYSource: Bank of Japan.Note: Figures are staff estimates. is somewhat higher. The potential growth rate seems to have been at although total factor productivity (TFP) has slightly picked up (Chart 6). This is because working hours have continued on a downtrend that reflects capital stock has decelerated as a result of the fixed stemming from the impact of COVID-19. As for the outlook, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately. This is based on the projection moderately, mainly reflecting advancement in decline in working hours will slow with the effects of working-style reforms diminishing, and (3) the growth of capital stock will accelerate cyclically. the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately have on is still highly unclear. In addition, there remain adapting to the post-pandemic economic and industrial structures, will advance or be sustained. the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some latitude. Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In fiscal 2021, as the impact of COVID-19 economy is expected to recover, partly supported accommodative financial conditions. That said, face-to-face services sector, is likely to remain vigilance against COVID-19 continuing. Exports are expected to follow a clear uptrend, led by that reflects digital-related demand. This uptrend in exports is also likely to be supported by a pick-up in exports face-to-face services, is likely to remain stagnant, affected by COVID-19 and public health progress with vaccinations, it is expected to increase, albeit only moderately, supported also profits are likely to continue on an improving trend external demand, despite being affected by deterioration in the terms of trade that reflects the fixed hotels, is likely to remain at a low level. However, with corporate profits improving, business fixed investment as a whole is expected to increase clearly, pushed up by an undertaking of postponed investment projects and an increase in to government spending, owing to the additional economic measures decided last fiscal year, in construction related building national resilience is likely to increase expected to continue showing a clear increase, pushed up by spending related to such factors as testing and vaccinations, In fiscal 2022, the economy is expected to continue growing external demand increasing, partly due to further progress with vaccinations. Exports are likely to continue increasing firmly, reflecting improvement increase is projected to be slower than in fiscal 2021. In this situation, corporate profits are expected to continue following their improving trend and business fixed investment is likely to continue increasing, including for digital-related investment, investment to address environmental is consumption is expected to become evident, also supported by progress with construction related to building and nursing care expenditures are projected to serve as support, government spending is likely to related to COVID-19 is expected to decrease. movements and going out, Japan's economy is expected to grow at a pace slightly above its rate, partly supported by accommodative financial conditions. Regarding exports, with overseas economies continuing to average, goods exports are likely to continue increasing moderately and demand, which is categorized under services exports, also is projected to increase clearly, reflecting a global recovery in travel demand due to progress with vaccinations. Although increases services sector, are expected to serve as support, fixed is to see due to adjustment pressure stemming from the consumption is projected to continue to see a it is likely to be pushed up by improvement in consume that comes along with dissipation of the impact of COVID-19. Meanwhile, despite being pushed down by a decrease in expenditure spending is expected to remain at a high level that is more or less the same as that of fiscal 2022, supported by progress in construction related to building national resilience and by an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Public investment has continued to increase moderately (Chart 7). Since early 2019, the amount of public construction completed, which is a coincident indicator, has continued to increase moderately, mainly for construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters. Orders received for public construction, which is a leading indicator, have shown a steady increase, as orders are being placed, mainly for construction related to building national resilience, which was budgeted in the additional economic is expected to continue increasing steadily for the time being, reflecting the progress in construction related to building projection period, it is projected to be at a relatively high level, supported by construction related to, for example, controlling flooding and addressing decaying infrastructures. Government consumption is expected to increase clearly for fiscal 2021, reflecting the pick-up in healthcare testing system, and progress with vaccinations. consumption is projected to see a lowering in its level since expenditure related to COVID-19 is 8 Following the three-year emergency response plan for disaster prevention, disaster mitigation, and building national resilience, which expired at the end of fiscal 2020, a new plan for building national resilience with a targeted period from fiscal 2021 through 2025 and a project size of about 15 trillion yen was decided by the Cabinet in December 2020. In reflection of this plan, public investment projects for disaster prevention, disaster mitigation, and building national resilience have been incorporated into the third supplementary budget for fiscal 2020 as major measures. Therefore, the implementation of the budget is expected to push up public investment.

In other words, the inflation rate has continued to be firm compared with the has been seen mainly in the services sector.

While price rises have been seen for a wide range of commodities, a closer look shows that, to date, prices of crude oil -- which accounts for a large share in Japan's imports of raw materials -- have not reached the high levels seen in the final phase of the rose significantly until immediately before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Instead, the current is characterized by particularly describes how the rise in these international commodity prices affects Japan's economy through its impact on corporate profits, taking also firm sizes. current phase is essentially due to the fact that supply has not kept pace with a surge in global demand. In more detail, such rise is attributable to for goods has been faster than most firms had anticipated, reflecting demand from China that has already started recovering ahead of other acceleration in digitalization triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. It seems that actual supply is not in the short run keeping up with the surge in have further accelerated, partly because market participants have factored Examples of these commodities are copper, which is increasingly used for electric vehicle (EV) palladium and rhodium, which are used for volume has decreased, directly affected by shortages, both continuing in various countries corporate profits may differ depending on the underlying mechanisms. In commodity prices is a recovery in overseas economies, as is the case in the current phase, it is necessary to take into account the following two channels through which Japan's economy is affected: an increase in external demand and export prices to import prices). In other words, if the rise in international commodity prices is associated with economies, exports will increase while the terms of trade will deteriorate in Japan. If the rise in international commodity prices is mainly caused to resource-exporting countries will be greater, meaning that Japan's economy will be affected by In order to examine the impact of real income to such changes in global relative prices, it is useful to take a look at real gross national income (GNI).22 Around the period of 2005-2008 -- which was during the \"commodity supercycle,\" or the phase of rising commodity prices -- Japan's real GNI was relatively weak compared with the real Japan's economy has started to experience rising commodity prices. It should be noted, however, the current phase has been brought about mainly by the recovery in economies accounting for a States, China, and the NIEs. Given this, the impact of the increase in exports essentially is likely to outweigh that of trading losses, and thus, prices will likely have positive effects on Japan's Outlook Report also assumes that, although the 22 Real GNI represents the total domestic and overseas income received by citizens (residents) and is calculated as follows: Real GNI = Real GDP + Trading gains/losses + Income from/to the rest of the world. 23 Trading gains and losses represent the change in real income associated with changes in the terms of trade and are calculated as follows: Trading gains/losses = (Nominal net exports / Weighted average of export and import deflators) \u2013 Real net exports. 10-8-6-4-202468192021<Current phase>s.a.,q/q % chg. 10-8-6-4-2024680506070809 s.a.,q/q % chg.CY<Previousphase of increasing commodity prices> rise in international commodity prices to date is likely to produce a negative impact of trading losses for the time being, the positive effects of the increase in exports and the associated spillover effects, such as on business fixed investment, will likely exceed this negative impact. analysis that underlie this assumption. to empirically examine model is estimated (Charts B2-3 and B2-4).

Although exports are projected to continue showing some weakness for the time being, they are expected to be on a moderate increasing trend, with overseas economies growing moderately on the whole. Domestic demand also is likely to follow an uptrend, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and the underpinnings through government spending, despite being affected by such factors as the consumption tax hike. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising throughout the projection period, despite such effects as of the decline in crude oil prices for the time being. \uf06c Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected growth rates are somewhat lower due to the delay in the timing of a pick-up in the growth pace of overseas economies. The projected rates of increase in the CPI are lower, mainly for the first half of the projection period, reflecting such factors as the decline in crude oil prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside, particularly regarding developments in overseas economies. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the downside risks to economic activity and uncertainties over developments in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. The momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is maintained but is not yet sufficiently firm, and thus developments in prices continue to warrant careful attention. 1 The text of \"The Bank's View\" -- the outlook for economic activity and prices as well as the Bank's thinking on the conduct of monetary policy, both of which are based on individual Policy Board members' views -- was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 30 and 31, 2019. Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from have continued to be affected by the slowdown in overseas economies. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have continued to be observed. In this situation, exports have continued to show some weakness. On the other hand, with corporate profits staying at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations due to such effects as of the and income situation. Housing investment and public investment have been more or less flat. Although exports have continued to show some weakness, industrial production also has been more or less flat, reflecting the increase in domestic demand, and labor market conditions have remained financial conditions are highly less fresh food, and the same hereafter) is in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend throughout the projection period -- that is, through fiscal 2021 -- as the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited, although the economy is likely to continue to be affected by the slowdown for the time being. As for overseas economies, the timing of a pick-up in the growth pace is likely to be delayed for longer than expected. Thus, exports are projected to continue showing some weakness for the time being. However, overseas economies are expected to grow moderately on the whole with the growth rates rising, partly backed by the materialization adjustments in IT-related goods. Under these circumstances, Japan's exports are projected to return to their moderate increasing trend. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, mainly against through government spending. Business fixed investment -- mainly investment related to research and development (R&D) investment for growth areas -- is likely to continue increasing moderately amid accommodative financial conditions, although the pace of increase is expected to decelerate temporarily, mainly for manufacturing, due to the capital stock are projected to exert downward pressure from a somewhat longer-term perspective. Private consumption is expected to follow a moderate increasing trend as the employment and income situation continues to improve, although it is likely to be pushed down temporarily due to the effects of the consumption tax hike.2 Meanwhile, government is expected to continue increasing reflecting expansion in expenditure such as for national resilience, and thereafter remain at a relatively high level. Thus, the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited. On this basis, Japan's economy is expected to grow temporarily at a somewhat slower pace than its potential, but moderately accelerate its growth pace thereafter.3 Thus, the economy is likely to continue growing at about the same pace as its potential on average. Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected growth rates are Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, short- and long-term real interest rates are assumed to be in negative territory throughout the projection period as the Bank pursues \"Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control.\"4 Financial institutions' active lending attitudes, as well as favorable conditions for corporate bond and CP issuance, are likely to be maintained conditions are likely to remain highly accommodative. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to follow a moderate uptrend throughout the projection period against the backdrop of the following continuing developments: progress in implementation of the government's growth strategy, including regulatory and 2 The consumption tax hike conducted in October 2019 is likely to affect the GDP growth rates through the following two channels: (1) fluctuations in demand prior to and after the hike and (2) a decline in real income. However, the impact on the growth rates is expected to be smaller than that of the previous tax hike in fiscal 2014, although it is subject to uncertainties, mainly because the government implemented various measures and the increase in demand prior to the hike was limited this time. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent recently. However, the estimate of the potential growth rate varies depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. Thus, it should be regarded as being subject to a considerable margin of error. 4 Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding future policy. strategy; and firms' fixed investment and efforts toward improving productivity. In addition, Japan's economy, monetary easing effects are likely to be enhanced. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been positive but has continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and tight labor This is basically because firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance, as well as households' cautiousness toward price rises, have not yet clearly changed in a situation where the mindset and behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched. Firms' efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs by raising productivity, the technological progress in recent years, and the high wage elasticity of labor supply also are contributing factors. In addition, the continued lackluster developments in administered prices and housing rent are likely to have affected the sluggishness in prices. It has been taking time to resolve these factors that have been delaying price rises, and the situation likely has continued in which the responsiveness of prices to the output gap, as well as inflation expectations that are strongly affected by the adaptive formation mechanism, do not rise easily. With regard to the outlook, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising throughout the projection period, despite such effects as of the decline in crude oil prices for the time being. Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected rates of increase in the CPI are lower, mainly for the first half of the projection period, reflecting such factors as the decline in crude oil prices.5 gradually toward 2 percent can be explained by the following factors that determine general price inflation. First, the output gap -- which shows the utilization of labor and capital -- has been substantially positive, reflecting tight labor market conditions and high levels of capital utilization rates. Regarding the outlook, although it is likely to narrow for 5 Assuming that the rise in the consumption tax is fully passed on to prices of taxable items, excluding those to which a reduced tax rate is applied, the effect of the October 2019 tax hike on the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for October 2019 onward is estimated to be 1.0 percentage point; the effects for fiscal 2019 and 2020 are estimated to be 0.5 percentage point for each fiscal year. In addition, based on a specific assumption using information available at this point, the effects of policies concerning the provision of free education on the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2019 and 2020 are estimated to be minus 0.3 percentage point and minus 0.4 percentage point, respectively. consumption tax hike, it is expected to remain at around the current level on average with the economy continuing on an expanding trend. Under such circumstances, further price rises are likely to be observed widely as households' tolerance of price rises increases, mainly reflecting a rise in wage growth rates, and firms' stance shifts toward further raising Second, medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently. As for the outlook, such expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend and component, a rise in the observed inflation rate is likely to push up inflation expectations, and (2) in terms of the forward-looking component, the Bank will pursue monetary easing through its strong commitment to achieving the price stability target, which will be effective in pushing up inflation expectations.6 Third, regarding import prices, the past decline in crude oil prices is likely to push down the CPI substantially through the fall in energy prices for the time being. However, such downward pressure is projected to diminish gradually thereafter. strengthening of efforts toward improving productivity, are expected to increase upward pressure on prices in the long term. Specifically, as the growth potential of the economy as a whole rises, reflecting such moves, firms' and households' spending behavior can be expected to become active. The following four factors are upside and downside risks to the Bank's baseline scenario regarding the economy. The first is developments in overseas economies. Specifically, the following are considered as risks: the consequences of protectionist moves and their effects; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies such as China; concerning overseas economies seem to be increasing, and it also is necessary to pay 6 Medium- to long-term inflation expectations can be regarded as consisting of two components: a forward-looking component, in which inflation expectations converge to the price stability target set by the central bank, and a backward-looking, or adaptive, component that reflects the observed inflation rate. For details, see the Bank's Comprehensive Assessment: Developments in Economic Activity and Prices as well as Policy Effects since the Introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) released in September 2016. The second risk is the effects of the consumption tax hike conducted in October 2019. The increase in demand prior to the tax hike has been small this time compared with that of the previous tax hike. However, the effects of the tax hike continue to warrant attention as they are likely to depend on consumer sentiment, the employment and income Third, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations may be either raised or lowered depending on the following: efforts to address medium- to long-term issues such as the declining birthrate and aging population; developments in regulatory declines, the economy may deviate downward from the baseline scenario through increasing concerns regarding the future and the rises in long-term interest rates associated with them. On the other hand, there also is a possibility that the economy will deviate upward from the baseline scenario if confidence in the path toward fiscal consolidation strengthens and concerns regarding the future are alleviated. As mentioned above, with regard to risks to economic activity, the downside risks concerning overseas economies in particular seem to be increasing. If these risks materialize, close attention should be paid to the possibility that prices also will be affected In addition, the specific factors that could exert upside and downside risks to prices are as follows. The first is developments in firms' and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Although inflation expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend, there is a risk that a rise in such expectations will be delayed through the adaptive formation mechanism if it takes longer than projected for firms' stance to shift toward further raising wages and prices and actual inflation consequently remains relatively sluggish. The second factor is the responsiveness of prices to the output gap. If firms' efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs by raising productivity continue for a long time, or stemming from these factors may last longer than expected. In addition, the lackluster developments in administered prices and housing rent also may continue to constrain the Third, developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices going forward, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices, may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the future conduct of monetary policy.7 The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent. Although it is necessary to carefully examine the risks to economic activity and prices, the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent appears to be maintained. This is because (1) firms' stance is expected to gradually shift toward further raising wages and prices with the output gap remaining positive, and (2) medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged and are projected to rise gradually as further price rises come to be observed widely. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. With regard to the outlook for economic activity, risks are skewed to the downside, particularly regarding developments in overseas economies. Regarding the outlook for prices, risks are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the long-term inflation expectations. Examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, there is no sign so far of excessively bullish expectations in asset markets or in the activities of financial institutions. However, prolonged downward pressure on among financial institutions continuing, could create risks of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation and of destabilizing the financial system. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.8 As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary 7 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" 8 For details, see the Bank's Financial System Report (October 2019). exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for the policy rates, the Bank expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. It will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. In particular, in a situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies, are significant, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.

The CPI figures for fiscal 2014 and 2015 exclude the direct effects of the consumption tax hike in April Looking back at Japan's economy since the July for the April-June quarter of 2019 registered marking 0.3 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis and 1.3 percent on an annualized basis (Chart 1). This was underpinned by an increase in domestic made a negative contribution, reflecting has maintained an uptrend and labor market conditions have remained tight (Charts 2 and 3). The output gap -- which captures the utilization of labor and capital -- for the April-June quarter has narrowed somewhat within positive territory as the while being at high levels, have declined (Chart 4). However, it has remained substantially positive. Indicators since July suggest exports, production, and business sentiment have continued to be affected by the slowdown in overseas economies, domestic demand has maintained an uptrend, despite such effects as of the consumption tax hike. Thus, Japan's economy is judged as having been on a moderate expanding trend with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained. 9 \"The Background\" provides explanations of \"The Bank's View\" decided by the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 30 and 31, 2019. 15-10-5051015111213141516171819 Active job openings-to-applicants ratio(right scale)Sources: Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; Ministryof Health, Labour and Welfare.Chart 2:LaborMarket Conditionss.a.,%CYs.a., ratio With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to maintain an expanding trend as the on domestic demand is expected to be limited on spending continuing to operate, although the economy is likely to continue to be affected by the slowdown for the time being. Exports will likely continue to show some weakness for the time being, with the timing of a pick-up in the growth pace of overseas economies being delayed. Thereafter, however, they are projected to return to their moderate increasing trend, with the growth rates of overseas economies rising gradually.10 Business fixed investment -- mainly to urban that aimed at meeting inbound tourism demand, labor-saving investment to address labor shortage, and R&D investment for growth areas -- is likely to continue increasing moderately, supported by highly by manufacturers, is projected to decelerate temporarily, reflecting the effects of the slowdown in overseas economies.

Therefore, due attention should be paid to downside risks to exports stemming from a further deceleration in overseas economies and a risk that business fixed investment will be pushed down further by such downside risks. 11 The consumption tax hike conducted in October 2019 will have some impact on the GDP growth rates, mainly due to changes in household spending, through the following two channels: (1) fluctuations in demand prior to and after the tax hike and (2) a Employed personsChart3:Labor ForceParticipation andEmployment 40-30-20-10010203040-8-6-4-20246885909500051015 Tankan factor utilizationindex (right scale)%reversed, DI (\"excessive\"-\"insufficient\"), % pointsChart 4:Output GapSource:Bank of Japan.Notes: 1.

Thus, the economy is likely to continue growing at about the same pace as its potential on average (Chart 5). Comparing projected growth rates are somewhat lower due to The potential growth rate is expected to follow a period against the backdrop of the following continuing decline in real income. At present, the negative impact of the tax hike on the growth rates for fiscal 2019 and 2020 is expected to be smaller than that of the previous tax hike in fiscal 2014. This is mainly due to the following: (1) there are technical factors that, as the tax hike was conducted in the middle of fiscal 2019, fluctuations in demand prior to and after the hike will offset each other during that fiscal year -- although they will push down the growth rate for fiscal 2020 -- and that the effects of the decline in real income will be dispersed over fiscal 2019 and 2020; (2) the increase in the consumption tax rate was smaller than that of the previous tax hike and a reduced tax rate was applied to some items; (3) free education was introduced and various measures to reduce the household burden of the tax hike as well as support measures to smooth out demand prior to and after the tax hike were implemented; and (4) before the previous tax hike in April 2014, it was likely that a front-loaded increase in demand was seen not only in view of that hike but also in anticipation of the second round of the tax hike, which was supposed to take place in October 2015. Although the increase in demand observed prior to the tax hike this time was constrained compared to that of the previous tax hike, it should be noted that the impact of the tax hike is uncertain and varies depending, for example, on developments in consumer sentiment. 2-101234585909500051015 Potential growth rateChart 5:Potential Growth Ratey/y % chg.FYSource: Bank of Japan.Note: Based on staff estimations.

However, it is expected that the timing of a pick-up will be delayed compared to that forecasted in the previous Outlook Report. The main factors behind this delay are (1) the impact of the intensified and prolonged U.S.-China trade friction and (2) the fact that it has been taking some time for the effects of China's fiscal policy to materialize.

However, as seen in some weakness in business fixed investment, the effects of the measures have been limited thus far, mainly reflecting the heightening uncertainties mentioned sales revenues -- which seem to have been allocated to capital for infrastructure investment projects -- have declined, reflecting the central government's stance of attaching importance on special bonds, which is also a means of funding infrastructure investment, has increased; however, this has not necessarily led to an acceleration in because there are restrictions on the use of funds regarding expansionary fiscal policy, there has been some delay in their materialization. However, these are expected to materialize gradually. The central government has eased the restrictions on local example, partly allowing their use as capital. In addition, regarding monetary policy, measures to increase lending to manufacturing firms have been implemented in an incremental manner -- 30-20-100102030354045505560650910111213141516171819 CYy/y % chg. 15015304548505254560910111213141516171819 CYy/y % chg. 60-40-2002040601516171819Chart B1-5:China's Land Sales Revenuesyear to date,y/y % chg.

From a somewhat longer-term perspective, it is expected that the trade volume in capital goods will gradually head to a recovery and Japan's capital goods exports also will return to a moderate increasing trend, as protectionist moves are likely to be prevented from being more intensified and global uncertainties are expected to follow a downtrend.

However, the number of indicators signaling a deterioration clearly has exceeded that during the period of the so-called exports can be assessed as increasing. In order to quantitatively assess these downside three months (exports at risk) were estimated using quantile regression, within which emitting signals was an explanatory variable (Chart B3-5[1]). Statistically speaking, this means estimating conditional probability distributions of next three months given the share of SCOPE indicators emitting signals.

By extracting and synthesizing the common factors can be confirmed that such expectations had remained in a weakening phase since summer 2015 but picked up somewhat toward 2018 and subsequently have been more or less flat (Chart B7-1).38 In addition, inflation expectations also can be gauged based on various economic indicators by using economic models, and the estimates indicate similar results to principal 1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.007080910111213141516171819 y/y % chg.CY 38 For details of methods to extract and synthesize inflation expectations see \"Developments in Inflation Expectations over the Three Years since the Introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE),\" Bank of Japan Review Series, no.16-E-13. using expectations have been generally more or less flat (Chart B7-2).39 In addition to estimates using the aforementioned various indicators and economic models, it is important to monitor changes in households' stance in order to grasp developments in people's the General Public's Views and Behavior can be regarded as a measure for households' tolerance of price rises (Chart B7-3). 40 Households' tolerance rose following the introduction of QQE in 2013 and declined temporarily thereafter. Since 2017, however, it has remained at a level that exceeds the average since the mid-2000s, albeit with fluctuations. In addition, when aggregating drinking services\" in the Tankan to look at the price-setting stance of firms that are closely related to household consumption, we see that it has continued on an improving trend within B7-4). Thus, there are signs that households' tolerance of price rises will increase and firms' stance will shift toward further raising prices, 39 The estimation methods for inflation expectations using economic models include (1) a method based on a model that incorporates learning -- in other words, the impact of people's short-term inflation forecast errors on expectations -- and (2) a method using a state-space model, based on theoretical relationships, for survey data and market indicators.

Regarding the outlook, it is expected that households' tolerance of price rises will increase steadily and firms' stance gradually will shift toward further raising prices as the employment and income situation is likely to continue improving with the economy maintaining an expanding trend and the output gap remaining positive. However, there is a possibility that a rise in inflation expectations will be delayed through the adaptive formation mechanism if (1) it takes longer than projected for households' tolerance of price rises to increase and for firms' stance to shift toward further raising prices and (2) actual inflation consequently remains relatively sluggish. Due attention should be paid to this possibility because it could become greater if risks to economic activity materialize and thereby put risks concerning overseas economies seem to be increasing.

Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2024 but are generally balanced thereafter. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on April 25 and 26, 2024. Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat. Industrial production has been more or less flat as a trend, but it has declined recently, Corporate profits have improved and business sentiment has stayed at a favorable level. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has been resilient, although the impact of price rises and developments such as a decline in automobile sales due to the suspension of shipment at some automakers have been observed. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been at around 2.5 percent recently, as services prices have continued to rise moderately, reflecting factors cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have waned. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies growing moderately and as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies against the background of factors such as accommodative Comparing the projections through fiscal 2025 with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2023 is lower, mainly reflecting lower private consumption due in part to the effects of the suspension of production and shipment at some automakers. The projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat lower, given that the GDP growth rate for the second half of fiscal 2023 is expected to be fairly lower than previously projected. The rate for fiscal 2025 is more or In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Against this backdrop, for the time being, although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to increase moderately, mainly reflecting the rise in wage growth and improvement in consumer sentiment. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned by the government's initiatives, such as the continuation of measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices and also cuts in income tax and In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend, mainly due to a pick-up in global demand for IT-related goods, as overseas economies grow moderately. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend with a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat. Government consumption is expected to increase moderately in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, the rate of increase is projected to be 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. pushed up through fiscal 2025 by the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices and a waning of the effects of the government's economic measures pushing down CPI inflation. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the Comparing the projections through fiscal 2025 with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 is higher, mainly due to the effects of the recent rise in crude oil prices, but that for fiscal 2025 is more or less unchanged. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges had pushed down 2023. For fiscal 2024 and 2025, the phasing out of these measures is projected to push up the rates. Looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to decelerate, due to a gradual waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices, and subsequently be at around 2 percent. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend, albeit with fluctuations. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to widen moderately within positive territory toward the end of the projection period. Meanwhile, labor market conditions are expected to tighten to a greater extent than can be explained by the changes in the output gap, partly due to a deceleration in the on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. The March 2024 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that figures for firms' inflation outlook for general prices have been at high levels. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and it is highly likely that firm wage increases that are higher than those seen in the previous year will be achieved in this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations. In addition, moves to reflect wage increases in selling prices have been strengthening. Regarding the outlook, inflation expectations are expected to rise moderately, with behavior. Under these circumstances, the virtuous cycle between wages and prices is projected to keep intensifying through achievement of wage increases that reflect price rises and through a pass-through of wage increases to selling prices. Considering the above assessments, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, mainly reflecting the improvement in the output gap and the rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations; in the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. That said, there remain uncertainties regarding this outlook, and it is necessary to carefully monitor factors such Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Inflation rates in the United States and Europe have followed a declining trend, albeit with fluctuations, and overseas central banks have apparently signaled future policy interest rate reductions. That said, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis and, in the case where inflation rates stay elevated through wage increases and other factors, there is a risk of tight monetary policy being prolonged. Moreover, since the policy interest rate hikes by overseas central banks to date have been rapid, there are uncertainties over how these hikes will affect their real economies and financial systems with a time lag. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. Meanwhile, depending on factors such as the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine and the Middle East, downward pressure on overseas economies could heighten. In addition, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets, and it is necessary to pay attention to how inventory adjustment pressure on some goods will affect overseas The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, other commodities will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. If the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. Moreover, with progress in the pass-through of the rise in import strengthen further, and this could push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is the impact of various changes in the environment surrounding Japan on firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations and on Japan's potential growth rate. It is expected that factors such as the experience of COVID-19, intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization and on labor market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Intensifying labor shortages -- which are partly due to demographic changes -- could accelerate labor-saving investment, such as for digitalization. On the other hand, if such a substitution of labor with capital does not sufficiently progress, there is a risk that supply-side constraints in some industries will push down the growth rate. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. Relatively high wage increases are likely to be achieved in this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, in view of factors such as the need to recruit and retain employees, with labor market conditions tightening. While moves to reflect price developments in wages have been strengthening, there remain uncertainties over the extent to which moves to reflect wage developments in selling prices will become widespread. It is expected in the baseline scenario that the virtuous cycle between wages and prices will continue to intensify. However, given that many firms, especially small and medium-sized firms, have reported that it has been difficult to pass on their employees' higher wages to their selling prices, the rise in selling prices could be limited. Since the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in Japanese society for a prolonged period, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether moves to pass on increases in wages and other costs to selling prices will weaken with the waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. On the other hand, moves to reflect wages in selling prices could strengthen to a greater extent than expected, and upward pressure on wages could intensify with labor market conditions tightening. In this situation, there is also a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario, accompanied The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including future developments in global inflation rates and possible fluctuations in foreign exchange markets, how these factors will affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with the virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There remain high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced for fiscal 2024 onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2024 but are generally balanced thereafter. Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has generally not been seen in asset prices was seen for a time and valuations of some properties seem to have been relatively high in the real estate market. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the abroad and in global financial markets, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. Moreover, financial institutions' resilience to rises in yen interest rates has headed toward improvement, mainly reflecting their portfolio rebalancing in securities investment. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, it will depend on future developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. Uncertainties surrounding these economic and financial developments at home and abroad remain high. If the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized and underlying inflation will increase, the Bank will adjust the degree of monetary accommodation, while it anticipates that accommodative financial conditions will be maintained for the time being.

As for the outlook, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately. This is based on the projection that, although there will be less room for the number of employed persons to increase, (1) TFP will continue to grow, mainly on the back of resulting capital, (2) the decline in working hours will come to a halt in reflection of the diminishing effects of stock will accelerate. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In fiscal 2024, Japan's economy is expected to continue recovering moderately, growing moderately and accommodative financial conditions being maintained. Goods exports are likely to see a moderate increase, as overseas economies grow moderately. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is expected to continue on an increasing household sector, nominal employee income is to keep increasing. This is because employment is likely to rise on the back of an wage growth is expected to remain relatively high the continuation of measures to reduce the also cuts in income tax and inhabitant tax, are 8 However, the output gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some latitude. For example, in terms of labor, it is highly uncertain what kind of working style will take hold going forward -- including among women and seniors -- given the experience of COVID-19, that of wage and price increases, and with demographic changes. In addition, in the corporate sector, it is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization will change Japan's economic and industrial structures; however, there remain high uncertainties over the extent of advancement and sustainability of innovation and sectoral reallocation of production factors, both of which aim at adapting to changes in the economic and industrial structures. projected to push up disposable income. In this situation, private consumption is expected to increase moderately, despite being affected by In fiscal 2025 and 2026, Japan's economy is expected to keep growing at a pace above its demand rising. Goods exports are likely to continuing to grow. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed is also expected to continue increasing, mainly for investment to address labor related to growth areas and decarbonization, and investment associated with strengthening supply is projected to slow somewhat, partly because it is likely to be pushed down by adjustment pressure on capital stock. In the household sector, nominal employee income is likely to keep rising steadily. This is because wage growth is expected to wages and prices strengthens further, although it will gradually become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high consumption is projected to continue increasing Public investment has been more or less flat (Chart 4).

As for the former, the Bank has conventionally used consumer price indicators that exclude highly volatile items (such as fresh food and energy) and indicators that use these indicators, like the CPI itself, have risen items have shown large increases in the wake of has recently developed a new indicator that items, which are susceptible to temporary factors, by classifying items based on their rate of price change (Chart B4-3[1]).32 While this indicator remained close to zero percent for the past 25 years or so, it has been rising gradually recently. indicators reflecting developments in labor costs, one method is to use a model to extract the part of changes in consumer prices that can be regarded would be to extract the trend component of the CPI for services, where labor costs account for a 31 The Bank has been compiling various measures of underlying inflation for many years and regularly releases some of them on its website.

Moreover, figures from 2016 onward are based on continuing observations following the sample revisions.2. Figures for the contribution of wage factors to CPI changes are based on therelationship between the CPI and wages, estimated using a 4-variable VAR model comprising import prices (yen basis), the output gap, wages (scheduled cash earnings of full-time employees), and priceindices forlow-, medium-, and high-volatility items in the CPI.

The second approach is to focus on indicators related to inflation expectations, which represent horizons, and have different meanings, statistical characteristics, and biases. In addition to carefully examining each of the individual indicators (Chart 39), the Bank has constructed a composite index that aggregates the information contained in each of the indicators using statistical methods.34 This composite index of inflation expectations has recently been hovering around the past 20-year detailed look shows that 1-year-ahead inflation expectations have declined somewhat in an adaptive manner that reflects the decline in actual have continued to rise moderately. Moreover, the participants all have been increasing recently 33 Conceptually, medium- to long-term inflation expectations correspond to the intercept of the Phillips curve (i.e., the intersection with the vertical axis) shown in Chart B4-1. 34 Specifically, using principal component analysis, the common components of each indicator are extracted. Moreover, the mean and variance of the aggregate indicators are based on the inflation expectations of economists and market participants, which have relatively small biases.

Trend inflation here is defined as the long-run value that actual inflation could converge to in the absence of literature provides a variety of models to estimate trend inflation, this box focuses on three. The first is a Phillips curve model with a time-varying intercept (Model 1). The second and third models autoregressive (VAR) model that captures the changing relationships between price inflation, trend inflation estimates have gradually increased in all models. It should be noted, however, that the results need to be interpreted with some caution since they largely depend on the assumptions made in the models and as the results may be revised when new data become available. All three approaches support, to varying degrees, the view that underlying inflation in Japan has been rising. It should be noted that all of the approaches presented in this box have limitations, such as the fact that they are based on specific and short-term changes in them should be interpreted with 1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.5070911131517192123 %CY it is necessary to take a variety of perspectives into account, including anecdotal information from firms, in addition to the analyses presented here.

First, a low nominal interest rate does not imply a highly accommodative Japan have remained close to 0 percent for a long inflation rate from 2000 to the early 2010s was expect prices to fall in the future, they have less to borrow consumption or investment. Therefore, in terms of is important to look at the real interest rate, which is there are various levels should be interpreted with some caution. measures with some assumptions -- is used to It suggests maturity have fluctuated only slightly, short-term (one-year) real interest rates, reflecting higher (1) have generally remained negative following the introduction of (QQE) in 2013 and (2) have become even more (10-year) real interest rates (1) have been clearly from 2022, real interest rates have been more or Second, for any given real interest rate level, the growth rate, the real interest rate level that is so-called natural rate of interest -- also tends to be higher, so the easing effects of any given real interest rate level will be larger.

At the same time, there is considerable variation in their levels, meaning that it is difficult to specify the level of the Third, it is also important to assess financial conditions by taking account of their impact on the decline in interest rates on the real economy are medium-term interest rates and become smaller should be noted that the impact of a decline in interest rates on the real economy may differ by maturity. In addition, as pointed out at the 35 In standard macroeconomic models, an increase in the degree of monetary accommodation, as measured by the real interest rate gap, is assumed to have a positive impact on the output gap. Previous studies such as Laubach and Williams (2003) estimated the natural rate of interest based on this relationship. Laubach, T. and J. C.

From this perspective, it can be classified government bonds, and the stock effect plays an important role in affecting long-term interest rates. several respects. First, as shown in Chart B6-3, the amount of purchases and/or holdings, interest (1) Interest rates would be volatile if the amount of JGB purchases is not changed flexiblyChart B6-3: Effect of Yield Curve Controlon Interest Rate Fluctuations Supply curve with inelastic JGB purchasesto demand changesSupply curveunder YCCDemand changesfor some reason (2) Interest rates tend to stabilize under YCC rates could fluctuate substantially in response to interest rates are allowed to fluctuate is fixed, so that fluctuations in interest rates are stabilized, the amount of purchases determined demand for JGBs. Second, if the Bank conducts YCC to keep interest rates strictly between the upper and lower bounds, interest rates may fall purchases actually being made, as market participants anticipate the conduct of YCC.38 Although YCC has such positive effects, it should be noted that it may also lead to a deterioration in market functioning, such as suppressing the price Moreover, when interest rates nearly reached the impact on market functioning increased, resulting markets, including the foreign exchange market. Chart B6-4 shows the results of estimating simple long-term interest rate models constructed on the basis of the above considerations. First, in order to capture the stock effect of JGB purchases in such a way that the models include the effects of future JGB holdings, the variable \"expected BOJ holdings of JGBs in the future\" is constructed on the basis of certain assumptions and used as an explanatory variable. Second, in order to capture the effects of setting a target range under YCC, the models include the probabilities that the targeted long-term yield exceeds the upper bound of the YCC range and that it exceeds the offer consecutive days,\" which are priced in the options 38 Studies (e.g., Hattori and Yoshida, 2023) show that, after the introduction of YCC, fluctuations in 10-year interest rates have indeed been contained.

Expected BOJ holdings of JGBs in the future denote the estimated share of the BOJ's JGB holdings in the total amount outstanding 2 years ahead of each month, which would be realized under the assumption that the BOJ continues to purchase the same amount of JGBs in the next 2 years as in the corresponding month (up to September 2016) or purchase JGBs based on the monthly purchase schedule at that time (from October 2016). The share is calculated on the basis of the interest rate risk. The probability that the upper bound of the YCC range (the lower bound of the YCC range or the offer rate of the \"fixed-rate purchase operations for consecutive days\") is exceeded is the probability that long-term interest rates will exceed such level after 3 months, which is priced in the options market.3. The coefficients in Model 2 are the sum of the coefficients of the regression results for models with the two components --the expected short-term interest rate component and the term premium --of the 10-year interest rates as dependent variables.

Although it is difficult to quantify the effects of this statement using the analytical framework in this box since it does not indicate a specific target level of the long-term yield in advance, it is expected to contribute to the stable formation of long-term interest rates in a manner similar to the setting of an upper bound under YCC.

Thereafter, however, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, mainly due to the widespread vaccinations, the economy is likely to recover, supported by an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. From the middle of the projection period, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies in the overall economy, including the household sector, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace, albeit slower, above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to increase moderately in positive territory for the time being, reflecting a rise in energy prices. Thereafter, albeit with fluctuations due to temporary factors, it is projected to increase gradually as a trend, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected growth rate for fiscal 2021 is somewhat lower, mainly for exports and private consumption, but that for fiscal 2022 is somewhat higher. The projected rate of increase in the CPI for fiscal 2021 is lower, mainly due to the effects of the rebasing of the index. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19 and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In particular, there are high uncertainties over whether the resumption of economic activity can progress smoothly while public health is being protected. Attention also should be paid to a risk that the effects of supply-side constraints seen in some areas will be amplified or prolonged. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 27 and 28, 2021. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase as a trend, despite being weak recently due to the effects of supply-side constraints seen in some areas. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have continued to improve on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. Private consumption has shown signs of a pick-up recently, although downward pressure has remained strong, particularly on services consumption, mainly due to vigilance against COVID-19. Housing investment has picked up. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the same hereafter) has been at around 0 percent, mainly due to the rise in energy prices, despite being affected by COVID-19 and a reduction in mobile phone charges. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have picked up. The outlook for Japan's economy is that, for the time being, downward pressure stemming from COVID-19 is likely to remain on services consumption, and exports and production are expected to decelerate temporarily due to supply-side constraints. Thereafter, however, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, mainly due to the widespread vaccinations, the economy is likely to recover, supported by the increase in external In the corporate sector, a virtuous cycle is projected to continue operating, in which increases in exports and production that reflect steady external demand lead to a rise in business fixed investment, mainly through improvement in profits. In the household sector, it is highly likely that overall private consumption will pick up again because downward pressure on the face-to-face services sector is expected to gradually wane as the resumption of consumption activities progresses while public health is being protected, mainly due to the widespread vaccinations. Therefore, with improvement spreading from the corporate sector to the household sector, the recovery trend in the overall economy is projected to become pronounced. From the middle of the projection period, although the pace of economic growth is likely to decelerate somewhat, mainly reflecting a peaking-out of pent-up demand at home and abroad, the economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate because the virtuous cycle from income to spending is expected to intensify in the overall economy, including the household sector, supported by accommodative financial Looking at the outlook for economic activity in more detail, as the impact of COVID-19 wanes gradually, overseas economies are likely to continue growing, albeit with variation across countries and regions, supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies taken mainly in advanced economies. In this situation, although Japan's exports of goods, mainly automobile-related ones, are expected to decelerate temporarily due to the effects of supply-side constraints, they are projected to continue increasing as a trend on the tourism consumption, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry and travel restrictions continue but likely to recover thereafter. Corporate profits are projected to continue on an improving trend on the back of a recovery in domestic and external demand, despite being affected by deterioration in the terms of trade that reflects a rise in international commodity prices and by supply-side constraints. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear, mainly for machinery and digital-related investments, supported by sector is projected to remain weak for the time being. Private consumption, despite being restrained for the time being, mainly by vigilance against COVID-19, is expected to pick up again, supported by the materialization of progresses while public health is being protected, mainly due to the widespread private consumption is projected to become evident, supported by improvement in employee income. Employee income is likely to increase moderately on the back of a rise in the number of employees that reflects the recovery in domestic and external demand Public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is likely to increase clearly for fiscal 2021, mainly reflecting a pick-up in healthcare expenditure and enhancement of the testing and vaccination systems and the medical treatment system, but see a lowering in its level Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately, mainly on the back of capital stock growth due to the rise in business fixed investment.2 These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's measures to transform the economic The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase moderately in positive territory for the time being. That is, although the rate is projected to continue to be pushed down relatively significantly by the reduction in mobile phone charges, it is expected to increase toward around the end of 2021, mainly due to the rise in energy prices reflecting year's decline brought about by the \"Go To Travel\" campaign. When various temporary factors are excluded, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to remain steady and continue to show a moderate increase in positive territory. the reduction in mobile phone charges, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to increase gradually as a trend, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap -- which captures the utilization of labor and capital -- has been negative recently, it is projected to turn positive with the economy returning to a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, and continue to expand moderately from the middle of the projection period. Under these circumstances, as households' tolerance of price rises improves moderately, mainly reflecting an increase in wage inflation, and as firms' price-setting stance gradually becomes active, the pass-through of cost increases and a rise in selling prices are likely to become widely observed. In addition, the increase in actual inflation is expected to lead to a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations through the adaptive formation mechanism and thereby encourage Curve Control. It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March 2020 in response to the impact of COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. The government has 2 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be at around 0 percent or marginally positive. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms. Private financial institutions have actively fulfilled the functioning of financial intermediation. In this situation, although firms' financial positions have improved on the whole, mainly due to a pick-up in economic activity, weakness has remained, particularly for firms in industries facing subdued sales due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as small and medium-sized ones. and corporate bonds, has remained accommodative. On the back of financial system stability being maintained, the Bank considers that financial conditions will remain government's measures, and efforts made by private financial institutions, and that this will support an increase in private demand.3 Regarding the upside and downside risks to the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay attention to the following factors. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on consumption activities. There are high specifically regarding people's vigilance against COVID-19 and its impact on consumption variants, there is a risk that economic activity will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, economic activity could improve by more than expected because if, for example, public health is protected and people's vigilance lessens pent-up demand for services consumption will materialize relatively early. The second factor is the effects of supply-side constraints. Mainly due to a rapid recovery COVID-19 in Asia, supply-side constraints have been seen globally, including the procurement difficulties reflecting supply-chain disruptions. As the impact of COVID-19 wanes, demand imbalances and production and shipping bottlenecks are likely to head toward a resolution. However, if the effects of supply-side constraints are prolonged or amplified by more than expected, there is a risk that economic activity will deviate further 3 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. The third factor is developments in overseas economies. The growth rates of overseas economies are projected to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period, mainly reflecting further normalization of those economies and the peaking-out of economic stimulus measures taken in advanced economies. However, there is a risk that overseas economies, particularly emerging economies, will deviate downward from the baseline scenario if global financial conditions tighten by more than expected amid some emerging economies and over steps toward reducing monetary accommodation in activities, could be pushed up through, for example, rapid spending of household savings that have accumulated significantly across economies due to various restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. While it is likely that the economic structure and working style will be transformed toward the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization will see further advances, and efforts to address climate change will proceed, there are uncertainties over whether these developments raise or lower such If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is uncertainties over firms' price-setting behavior. In the baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, as described earlier, it is projected that firms' price-setting stance will gradually become active with continuing improvement in the output gap. That said, given, in Japan is complex and sticky, firms' price-setting behavior in the future entails uncertainties, including a risk that the pass-through of cost increases to selling prices, particularly to downstream or consumer prices, which are closer to final demand, will not The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Thus, it is necessary to continue paying attention to In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. Although it will take time, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19 and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In particular, there are high uncertainties over whether the resumption of economic activity can progress smoothly while public health is being protected. Attention also should be paid to the risk that the effects of supply-side constraints seen in some areas will be amplified or prolonged. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole, despite the fact that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on economic and financial activity at home and abroad. In addition, even in the case of a future resurgence of COVID-19, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

In August 2021, the base year of the CPI was changed from 2015 to 2020, and figures for the year-on-year rate of change from January 2021 onward were retroactively revised. Accordingly, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items excluding fresh food for the April-June quarter of 2021 was revised downward by around 0.7 percentage points; namely, from around 0.1 percent (2015-base) to minus 0.6 percent (2020-base). This is mainly because the negative contribution of mobile phone charges to the CPI expanded from around 0.6 percentage points to around 1.1 percentage points. The changes to the CPI forecasts in this Outlook Report from the previous ones are largely attributable to the rebasing of the CPI. 2.0-1.00.01.02.0-2.0-1.00.01.02.02015201620172018201920202021202220232024 FY 5.0-4.0-3.0-2.0-1.00.01.02.03.04.0-5.0-4.0-3.0-2.0-1.00.01.02.03.04.02015201620172018201920202021202220232024 FY Notes: 1.

In addition, as fixed investment plan for fiscal 2021 indicates that investment is likely to see high growth this fiscal year. As suggested by these developments, a fixed investment, triggered by the increase in external demand, has continued to operate. The output gap -- which captures the utilization of labor and capital -- continued to improve in negative territory from the bottom hit in the April-June quarter of 2020, when the gap had deteriorated substantially. However, the gap for the April-June quarter of 2021 was more or less reflecting emergency (Chart 4).

The implementation of the third supplementary budget for fiscal 2020 and the initial budget for fiscal 2021 based on the aforementioned measures is expected to support economic activity, mainly through increases in public investment and government consumption. the Cabinet decided on automobile-related ones, are expected to supply-side constraints on parts stemming from the spread of COVID-19 in the ASEAN countries, they are projected to continue increasing as a trend on the tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to remain subdued travel restrictions continue. is around the world and the restrictions are lifted. With regard to private consumption, it is expected for the time being that services consumption will be restrained by vigilance against COVID-19 and durable goods consumption will be pushed down automobiles. However, private consumption is expected to pick up again, supported by the consumption activities progresses while public health is being protected, mainly due to the private consumption is projected to become evident, supported by improvement in employee income. Despite weakness remaining for the time being in employment of non-regular workers in income is likely to increase moderately, with a time lag following the recovery in domestic and fixed and some firms in the transportation industry is projected to remain weak for the time being, an uptrend is expected to become clear, mainly for supported by accommodative financial conditions, with corporate profits following an improving trend. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to building national resilience, which is included in the government's additional economic measures formulated at the end of 2020. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is likely to increase clearly for fiscal 2021, reflecting consumption is projected to see a lowering in its level, since expenditure related to COVID-19 is likely to decrease. Reflecting these developments in demand both at is expected to register a relatively large positive waning gradually and supported by the increase measures.

This is because working hours have continued on a downtrend that reflects capital stock has decelerated as a result of the fixed stemming from the impact of COVID-19. As for the outlook, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately. This is based on the projection reflecting advances decline in working hours will slow with the effects of working-style reforms diminishing, and (3) growth in capital stock will accelerate cyclically. However, there remain high uncertainties over the extent to which the following developments will advance or be sustained: innovation by the corporate sector with the aim of adapting to the including actions addressing growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some latitude. Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In the second half of fiscal 2021, as overseas economies continue to recover on the whole, Japan's economy is expected to recover, supported by conditions.

Looking back at the first half of fiscal 2021, private fluctuated in the short run but on average remained stagnant at a level below that prior to the pandemic (Chart B3-1). This box examines considering their relationship with the COVID-19 and progress with vaccinations. It should be noted that the results of the analysis presented in this box should be interpreted with some latitude because the analysis is based on limited data obtained under the unusual situation of the Economy Watchers Survey (household activity,DI for current conditions, level, right scale)Sources: Bank of Japan; Cabinet Office, etc.Note: Figures for the Consumption Activity Index (CAI) are based on staff calculations. The CAI figures (travel balance adjusted) exclude inbound tourism consumption and include outbound tourism consumption.Chart B3-1:Developments in Private Consumption Consumption Activity Index (travel balanceadjusted, real, left scale) pandemic. It is therefore important to assess recent developments based on various data and analyses. Recent consumption developments as measured -- are as follows. Although consumption declined for the April-May period of reflecting emergency, it picked up temporarily for June, with heading improvement and the state of emergency being lifted late in the month for most regions (some of them shifted to priority measures to prevent the spread of disease). Consumption for July was almost unchanged from June, remaining firm confirmed new cases of COVID-19 and the fourth state of emergency declared for Tokyo. However, it turned to a decline for August, against the state of emergency was declared. A key to understanding these private consumption developments is to grasp those of seniors, whose expenditures account for a large share in total services consumption developments based on exhibited those by seniors showed no is noteworthy that, for the period from June through August in particular, seniors were not so active in terms of consumption that involved going out and traveling , even though they were ahead of other age groups with respect to progress with vaccinations. To examine the relationship between recent vaccinations, an analysis is made using microdata from a survey conducted by Imperial College London and YouGov in selected countries. This survey asks respondents a number of questions, such as \"how often have you avoided crowded areas?\" and \"have you had the first or second doses of a COVID-19 vaccine?\" Of the survey results, the proportion of respondents answering that they do not avoid crowded areas can be interpreted as indicating people's willingness to 50-40-30-20-1001020304050Jan. 20JulyJan. 21July change from baseline, % go out. 24 In fact, this willingness is highly correlated with selective services expenditures as measured by the CAI and thus can be regarded international comparison shows that Japanese were less willing to go out relative to U.S. and U.K. respondents, suggesting Japanese people's pandemic, while this also seems to partly reflect Next, an ordered probit model is estimated to explain the willingness to go out using variables COVID-19 in the region where the respondent is based, the stringency index -- which indicates the respondent is vaccinated and for their age and gender (Chart B3-4).25 The estimation results, there was no statistically significant change in the willingness to go out of 24 Answers to the question \"how often have you avoided crowded areas?\" range from 1 (\"always\") to 5 (\"not at all\"). The proportion of people answering 3, 4, or 5 to this question was used for the analysis here. 25 The causality between whether or not a person is vaccinated and the willingness to go out may run in both directions. Specifically, on the one hand, a person may become less vigilant against COVID-19 after getting vaccinated, and on the other hand, a person with higher vigilance may be more willing to get vaccinated. To address the estimation problem arising from this (i.e., endogenous biases of estimated parameters), not fully vaccinated level of respondents who expressed some disagreement in answer to the question \"to what extent do you agree or disagree that COVID-19 is very dangerous for you?\" are excluded from the sample, and thus the analysis was limited to those who have at least some vigilance against COVID-19.

In addition, signs of a pick-up have been observed seniors, which showed no notable through August (Chart B3-2).

While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that, with a growing sense of labor shortage, the output gap will improve and medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. Through fiscal 2025, rice prices are likely to be at high levels and the effects of the government's measures pushing down inflation will dissipate, and these factors are expected to make a positive contribution to the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food). \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rates are more or less unchanged. The projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 and 2025 are higher, reflecting the rise in rice prices and the higher import prices stemming from factors such as the recent depreciation of the yen. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. In particular, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2024 and 2025. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 23 and 24, 2025. Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. Overseas economies have grown moderately on the whole. Exports and industrial production have been more or less flat. Corporate profits have been on an improving trend and business sentiment has stayed at a favorable level. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has been on a moderate increasing trend despite the impact of price rises and other factors. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been at around 3 percent recently, as services prices have continued to rise moderately, reflecting factors such as wage increases, and as the government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher energy prices have been scaled back, although the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have waned. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies continuing to grow moderately and as a virtuous cycle from income The projected real GDP growth rates are more or less unchanged from those presented in In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased situation, nominal wages are expected to keep increasing clearly, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Against this backdrop, for the time being, although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately, mainly reflecting the rise in wage growth. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned, for the time being, by the 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and, with regard to the future conduct of policy, referring to views incorporated in financial markets that the policy interest rate will rise moderately. government's initiatives such as the continuation of measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline and other prices, despite these measures being scaled back. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend, mainly due to a recovery in global demand for IT-related goods, as overseas economies continue to grow moderately. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend with a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat. Government consumption is expected to increase moderately in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be in the around 2 percent for fiscal 2026. While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that, with a growing sense of labor shortage, the output gap will improve and medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. Through fiscal 2025, rice prices are likely to be at high levels and the effects of the government's measures pushing down inflation will dissipate, and these factors are expected to make a positive 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be around 0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are high uncertainties over how factors such as advances in digitalization will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 and 2025 are higher, reflecting the rise in rice prices and the higher import prices stemming from factors such as the recent depreciation of the yen. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges had pushed down 2023. For fiscal 2024 and 2025, the phasing out of these measures is projected to push up the rates. Looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to be at around 2 percent, mainly because services and other prices are expected to continue rising moderately, reflecting factors such as wage increases, and rice prices are likely to rise, although the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are projected to wane gradually. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend, albeit with fluctuations. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to widen moderately within positive territory toward the end of the projection period. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have tightened to a greater extent than can be explained by the changes in the output gap, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors. In this situation, upward pressure on wages and prices is likely to be stronger than suggested by the output gap, given that firms in many industries have started to face labor supply constraints. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. Firms' inflation outlook has increased moderately. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and nominal wages have increased clearly. In addition, with wages continuing to rise, there has been an increase in moves to reflect higher costs, such as increased personnel expenses and distribution costs, in selling prices. Regarding the outlook, with labor market conditions remaining tight, inflation expectations are expected to rise moderately, as changes in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior are likely to continue. Under these circumstances, the virtuous cycle between wages and prices is projected to keep intensifying through achievement of wage increases that reflect price rises and through a pass-through of wage increases to selling prices. With regard to this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, there have been many views expressed by firms stating that they will continue to raise wages steadily, following the solid wage increases last year. Considering the above assessments, with a growing sense of labor shortage, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, mainly reflecting the improvement in the of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. That said, there remain uncertainties regarding this outlook, and it is necessary to carefully monitor factors such as firms' wage- and Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. While attention has been drawn to uncertainties surrounding policy conduct in the United States, the U.S. economy has been solid, and global financial and capital markets have been stable on the whole. However, attention continues to be warranted on the possibility that these uncertainties surrounding policy conduct will have global economy and global financial and capital markets. In addition, in the United States and Europe, uncertainties remain regarding the impact of past policy interest rate hikes. Meanwhile, depending on factors such as the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine and the Middle East, downward pressure on overseas economies could heighten. Regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of growth, as adjustment pressure has continued in the real estate and labor markets, and it is necessary to pay attention to how excessive supply capacity of some goods will affect The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, including grains. Attention continues to be warranted on the risk that prices of grains and other commodities will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. Moreover, with progress in the pass-through of the rise in import strengthen further, and this could push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is the impact of various changes in the environment surrounding Japan on firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations and on Japan's potential growth rate. It is expected that factors such as the experience of COVID-19, intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization and on labor market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Intensifying labor shortages -- which are partly due to demographic changes -- could accelerate labor-saving investment, such as for digitalization. On the other hand, if such a substitution of labor with capital does not sufficiently progress, there is a risk that supply-side constraints in some industries will push down the growth rate. Furthermore, factors such as heightened geopolitical risks and growing trade frictions could change the trend of globalization. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and it is expected in the baseline scenario that the virtuous cycle between wages and prices will continue to intensify. However, given that firms, especially small and medium-sized firms, have continued to report that it has been difficult to pass on their employees' higher wages to their selling prices, it will be necessary to pay close attention to whether moves to pass on increases in costs, including wages, to selling prices will weaken with the waning of the effects of the pass-through of import prices to consumer prices. On the other hand, moves to reflect wages in selling prices could strengthen to a greater extent than expected, and upward pressure on wages could intensify with growing expectations that labor market conditions will continue to be tight. In this situation, there is also a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario, accompanied by a rise in medium- The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. In addition, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent for Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that, with a growing sense of labor shortage, the output gap will improve and medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with the virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There remain high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2024 and 2025. Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has generally not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities, although attention continues to be warranted on the pace of increase in stock and real estate prices. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. In addition, even in the case of an financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. Moreover, financial institutions' resilience to rises in yen interest rates has headed toward improvement, mainly reflecting 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" their portfolio rebalancing in securities investment. When examining financial imbalances such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close As for the conduct of monetary policy, while it will depend on developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions going forward, given that real interest rates are at significantly low levels, if the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized, the Bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation.

Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is expected 6 However, the output gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some latitude. For example, in terms of labor, it is highly uncertain what kind of working style will take hold going forward -- including among women and seniors -- given the experience of COVID-19, that of wage and price increases, and with demographic changes. In addition, in the corporate sector, it is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization will change Japan's economic and industrial structures; however, there remain high uncertainties over the extent of advancement and sustainability of innovation and sectoral reallocation of production factors, both of which aim at adapting to changes in the economic and industrial structures. to continue on an increasing trend, mainly on the is likely to continue to see a clear increase, reflecting a rise in employment on the back of an to reduce the household burden of higher energy prices, are projected to push up disposable income. In this situation, private consumption is expected to remain on a moderate increasing trend, despite being affected by price rises. In fiscal 2025 and 2026, Japan's economy is expected to grow at a pace above its potential rising. With overseas economies continuing to grow moderately, goods exports are likely to demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is also expected to continue increasing, mainly for investment to address labor related to growth areas and decarbonization, and investment associated with strengthening supply chains. In the household sector, regarding the is likely to continue to see a clear increase.

The mode is the inflation rate with the highest density in the price change distribution. The weighted median is the average of the inflation rates of the items at around the 50 percentile point of the cumulative distribution in terms of weight. Each indicator is calculated using data for each CPI item that excludes the effects of the consumption tax hikes, policies concerning the provision of free education, and travel subsidy programs. 18 In this report, the mode is defined as the inflation rate with the highest density in the distribution that is estimated parametrically by fitting a normal inverse Gaussian distribution to the observed price change distribution in each period. It should be noted that, with dispersions of the observed distributions increasing, the fit of the normal inverse Gaussian distribution has deteriorated recently. Therefore, estimates of this mode should be interpreted with some latitude. 1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.50911131517192123 ModeChart 36:CPI: Trimmed Mean, etc.y/y% chg.Sources: Bank ofJapan; Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.Note: Based on staff calculations using the CPI excluding the effects of the consumption tax hikes, policies concerning the provision of free education, and travel subsidy programs.

After the impact of the rebound caused by the phasing out of the government's measures dissipates, the rate is projected to be more or less 21 The year-on-year rate of change in energy prices has been positive recently due to (1) the discontinuation of the government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher electricity and gas charges, which were introduced in 2023, and (2) price hikes reflecting the past rise in crude oil prices. Looking at the energy-related economic measures in more detail, with regard to gasoline subsidies, the government has continued to provide subsidies to petroleum distributors and importers as funds to contain a sharp rise in their selling prices. The amount of subsidies provided was reduced gradually after the turn of 2023, but was increased again in September 2023, so that the nationwide average for regular gasoline prices remained at a level of around 175 yen per liter from October 2023 through mid-December 2024. Thereafter, the subsides were scaled back by around 5 yen per liter in mid-December 2024 and again in mid-January 2025. As for electricity charges, the government discontinued the discounts at the end of June 2024, and the year-on-year rate of change in these charges increased in July and August 2024; however, the government then cut the charges by 4 yen per kilowatt-hour for September and October 2024, and reduced the charges by 2.5 yen per kilowatt-hour for November. These cuts made a negative contribution to the year-on-year rate of change in electricity charges. The government has announced a resumption of the discounts for February through April 2025, with a discount of 2.5 yen per kilowatt-hour for February and March, and 1.3 yen per kilowatt-hour for April. (The months refer to the timing at which the charges are calculated.) Regarding manufactured and piped gas charges, measures to reduce the household burden roughly similar to those for electricity charges are being implemented.

Price increases taking place in those months are important indications of whether inflation will be sustained. Indeed, a look at the shows that prices have risen in April and October 25 Several factors are likely to have contributed to a rise in the price of rice, including upward pressure on costs (e.g., fertilizer and fuel) and a tightening of supply and demand. recently, at about the same level as seen in the first half of the 1990s when services prices were rising on the whole (Chart B5-2[1]). Moreover, the chart shows that, in years in which price increases were higher in April and October, the frequency of increases in other months was also higher. To confirm this point, a test was carried out to determine whether there is any difference by price changes. The results show that there are no major statistical differences (Chart B5-2[2]). Given the above, in order to gauge the persistence in the momentum of CPI inflation, it is important to see whether price changes are also taking place analyzing developments in the prices of general services. Turning to developments in the latter half of 2024, there were firms that increased the price of items in \"dining out\" and \"services related to domestic duties,\" mainly reflecting a rise in raw material and labor costs. Although major price changes are likely to take place in April and October, price increases in other months are also important in examining the momentum of CPI Finally, to identify trends in services prices, it is crucial to assess the relationship between wages they continue to be on a moderate uptrend (Chart B5-3).

Domestic demand also is likely to follow an uptrend, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and the underpinnings through government spending, despite being affected by such factors as the scheduled consumption tax hike. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been positive but has continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and tight labor market conditions. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. Nonetheless, with the output gap remaining positive, firms' stance gradually will shift toward further raising wages and prices, and households' tolerance of price rises will increase. In this situation, further price rises are likely to be observed widely and then medium- to long-term inflation expectations are projected to rise gradually. As a consequence, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent. \uf06c Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, both the projected growth rates and the projected rates of increase in the CPI are more or less unchanged. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside, particularly regarding developments in overseas economies. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the downside risks to economic activity and uncertainties over developments in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. The momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is maintained but is not yet sufficiently firm, and thus developments in prices continue to warrant careful attention. 1 The text of \"The Bank's View\" -- the outlook for economic activity and prices as well as the Bank's thinking on the conduct of monetary policy, both of which are based on individual Policy Board members' views -- was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 29 and 30, 2019. 2 The July 2019 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) assumes that the consumption tax will be raised to 10 percent in October 2019 and that a reduced tax rate will be applied to food and beverages -- excluding alcohol and dining-out -- and newspapers. Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, although exports, production, and business sentiment have been affected by the slowdown in overseas economies. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have been observed. In this situation, exports have shown some weakness. On the other hand, with corporate profits staying at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend. Private consumption has been increasing moderately against the increase in demand prior to the scheduled consumption tax hike has started to be seen in part, albeit to a marginal extent compared with that of the previous tax hike. Housing investment and public investment have been more or less flat. Although exports have shown some weakness, industrial production also has been more or less flat, reflecting the increase in domestic demand, and labor market conditions have remained tight. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food, and the same hereafter) is at around 0.5 percent. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend throughout the projection period -- that is, through fiscal 2021 -- despite being affected by the slowdown in overseas economies for the time being. Specifically, as for the outlook for Japan's economy for the time being, exports are projected to show some weakness and business fixed investment also is likely to decelerate somewhat, both reflecting the effects of the slowdown in overseas economies. However, private consumption is expected to continue increasing as the employment and income situation continues to improve, and also partly because of the increase in demand prior to the scheduled consumption tax hike in October 2019. Public investment also is likely to increase, reflecting Olympic Games-related demand, the implementation of the Thereafter, overseas economies are expected to grow moderately on the whole with the growth rates rising somewhat, partly backed by the materialization of the effects of goods. Under these circumstances, Japan's exports are projected to return to their cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household the underpinnings through government spending, despite being affected by such factors as the scheduled consumption tax hike. Business fixed investment -- such as that intended for domestic capacity expansion in line with the economic expansion, that related to urban redevelopment projects, and labor-saving investment to address labor shortage -- is likely to increase moderately amid accommodative financial conditions, despite downward pressure resulting mainly from cyclical adjustments in capital stock accompanying the prolonged economic expansion. Private consumption also is expected to follow a moderate increasing trend as the employment and income situation continues to improve and the government implements countermeasures for the scheduled consumption tax hike, although it is likely to be pushed down for some time due to the effects of the hike.3 Meanwhile, public investment is expected to continue increasing through fiscal 2020 and thereafter maintain a relatively high level in fiscal 2021. On this basis, Japan's economy is likely to continue growing at about the same pace as its potential on average.4 Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected growth rates are more or less unchanged. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, short- and long-term real interest rates are assumed to be in negative territory throughout the projection period as the Bank pursues \"Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control.\"5 Financial institutions' active lending attitudes, as well as favorable conditions for corporate bond and CP issuance, are likely to be maintained conditions are likely to remain highly accommodative. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to follow a moderate uptrend throughout the government's growth strategy, including regulatory and institutional reforms; an continued efforts toward improving productivity. In addition, as the natural rate of interest 3 The consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019 will affect the GDP growth rates through the following two channels: (1) the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand prior to and after the consumption tax hike and (2) a decline in real income. Although it is subject to uncertainties, the negative impact on the growth rates is expected to be smaller than that of the previous tax hike in fiscal 2014. 4 Under a specific methodology, Japan's potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent recently. However, the estimate of the potential growth rate varies depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. Thus, it should be regarded as being subject to a considerable margin of error. 5 Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding future policy. easing effects are likely to be enhanced. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been positive but has continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and tight labor This is basically because firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance, as well as households' cautiousness toward price rises, have not yet clearly changed in a situation where the mindset and behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched. Firms' efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs on prices by raising productivity, the technological progress in recent years, and the high wage elasticity of labor supply also are contributing factors. In addition, the continued lackluster developments in administered prices and housing rent are likely to have affected the sluggishness in prices. It has been taking time to resolve these factors that have been delaying price rises, and the situation likely has continued in which the responsiveness of prices to the output gap, as well as inflation expectations that are strongly affected by the adaptive formation mechanism, do not rise easily. With regard to the outlook, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising. Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected rates of increase in the CPI are more or less unchanged.6 gradually toward 2 percent can be explained by the following factors that determine general price inflation. First, the output gap -- which shows the utilization of labor and capital -- has been substantially positive, reflecting tight labor market conditions and high levels of capital utilization rates, and is expected to remain so. Under such circumstances, further price rises are likely to be observed widely as households' tolerance of price rises increases, mainly reflecting a rise in wage growth rates, and firms' stance shifts toward further raising prices. 6 Assuming that the rise in the consumption tax will be fully passed on to prices of taxable items, excluding those to which a reduced tax rate will be applied, the effect of the October 2019 consumption tax hike on the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for October 2019 onward is estimated to be 1.0 percentage point; the effect for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 is estimated to be 0.5 percentage point for each year. In addition, based on a specific assumption using information available at this point, the effects of policies concerning the provision of free education on the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 are estimated to be minus 0.3 percentage point and minus 0.4 percentage point, respectively. Second, medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently. As for the outlook, such expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend and component, a rise in the observed inflation rate is likely to push up inflation expectations, and (2) in terms of the forward-looking component, the Bank will pursue monetary easing through its strong commitment to achieving the price stability target, which will be effective in pushing up inflation expectations.7 Third, regarding import prices, the past decline in crude oil prices is likely to exert downward presure on the CPI through energy prices for the time being. firms' strengthening of efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs on prices by raising productivity, are expected to increase upward pressure on prices in the long term. Specifically, as the growth potential of the economy as a whole rises, reflecting such moves, firms' and households' spending behavior can be expected to become active. The following four factors are upside and downside risks to the Bank's baseline scenario regarding the economy. The first is developments in overseas economies. Specifically, the following are considered as risks: the U.S. macroeconomic policies and their impact on global financial emerging and commodity-exporting economies such as China, including the effects of the and geopolitical risks. Downside risks concerning overseas economies are likely to remain significant, and uncertainties regarding the effects of protectionist moves in particular have been heightening. It also is necessary to pay close attention to the impact of such The second risk is the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019. These are likely to depend on consumer sentiment, the employment and 7 Medium- to long-term inflation expectations can be regarded as consisting of two components: a forward-looking component, in which inflation expectations converge to the price stability target set by the central bank, and a backward-looking, or adaptive, component that reflects the observed inflation rate. For details, see the Bank's Comprehensive Assessment: Developments in Economic Activity and Prices as well as Policy Effects since the Introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) released in September 2016. Third, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations may be either raised or lowered depending on the following: efforts to address medium- to long-term issues such as the declining birthrate and aging population; developments in regulatory declines, the economy may deviate downward from the baseline scenario through increasing concerns regarding the future and the rises in long-term interest rates associated with them. On the other hand, there also is a possibility that the economy will deviate upward from the baseline scenario if confidence in the path toward fiscal consolidation strengthens and concerns regarding the future are alleviated. As mentioned above, with regard to risks to economic activity, the downside risks concerning overseas economies in particular are significant. If these risks materialize, there is a possibility that prices also will be affected to some extent. In addition, the specific factors that could exert upside and downside risks to prices are as follows. The first is developments in firms' and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Although inflation expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend, there is a risk that a rise in such expectations will be delayed through the adaptive formation mechanism if it takes longer than projected for firms' stance to shift toward further raising wages and prices and actual inflation consequently remains relatively sluggish. The second factor is the responsiveness of prices to the output gap. If firms' efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs on prices by raising productivity continue for a long time, stemming from these factors may last longer than expected. In addition, the lackluster developments in administered prices and housing rent also may continue to constrain the Third, developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices going forward, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices, may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the future conduct of monetary policy.8 The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent. Although it is necessary to carefully examine the risks to economic activity and prices, the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent appears to be maintained. This is because (1) firms' stance is expected to gradually shift toward further raising wages and prices with the output gap remaining positive, and (2) medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged and are projected to rise gradually as further price rises come to be observed widely. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. With regard to the outlook for economic activity, risks are skewed to the downside, particularly regarding developments in overseas economies. Regarding the outlook for prices, risks are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the long-term inflation expectations. Examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, there is no sign so far of excessively bullish expectations in asset markets or in the activities of financial institutions. However, prolonged downward pressure on among financial institutions continuing, could create risks of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation and of destabilizing the financial system. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for policy rates, the Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, at least through around spring 2020, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including developments in examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make 8 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. In particular, in a situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies, are significant, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.

The CPI figures for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 exclude the direct effects of the consumption tax hike in Looking back at Japan's economy since the April for the January-March quarter of 2019 registered basis and its annualized rate was 2.2 percent (Chart 1). A large contributing factor to this increase is the substantial decline in imports, which are deducted from GDP. While exports declined due economies, domestic demand continued increase, albeit marginally, mainly led by business fixed investment. Amid these developments in employed persons has maintained an uptrend and labor market conditions have remained tight (Charts 2 and 3). The output gap -- which captures the utilization of labor and capital -- for the January-March quarter has narrowed, reflecting some weakness industrial production, but has been substantially positive (Chart 4). Indicators since April suggest that domestic demand, such as business fixed investment and private consumption, has maintained an uptrend, although exports, production, and business sentiment have continued to be affected by the slowdown in 15-10-5051015111213141516171819 Active job openings-to-applicants ratio(right scale)Sources: Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; Ministryof Health, Labour and Welfare.Chart 2:LaborMarket Conditionss.a.,%CYs.a., ratio overseas economies. Thus, Japan's economy is judged as having been on a moderate expanding spending being maintained. 9 \"The Background\" provides explanations of \"The Bank's View\" decided by the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 29 and 30, 2019. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to maintain an expanding trend, despite being affected by the slowdown in overseas hike for the time being. Exports will likely show some weakness as they are expected to be affected by the slowdown in overseas economies for the time being. Thereafter, however, they are projected to return to their moderate increasing rising gradually. Business fixed is to continue increasing Employed personsChart3:Labor ForceParticipation andEmployment conditions, although its pace of increase is projected to decelerate, reflecting cyclical downward pressure resulting from capital stock adjustments. Private consumption is expected to maintain a moderate increasing trend as the employment and income situation continues to tax hike, although it is likely to be pushed down for some time due to the hike. 10,11 Meanwhile, 10 The July 2019 Outlook Report assumes that the consumption tax will be raised to 10 percent in October 2019 and that a reduced tax rate will be applied to food and beverages -- excluding alcohol and dining-out -- and newspapers. 11 The scheduled consumption tax hike in October 2019 will have some impact on the GDP growth rates, mainly due to changes in household spending, through the following two channels: (1) the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand prior to and after the consumption tax hike and (2) the decline in real income. At present, the negative impact of the tax hike on the growth rates for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 is expected to be smaller than that of the previous tax hike in fiscal 2014. This is mainly due to the following: (1) there are technical factors that, as the consumption tax hike is scheduled to take place in the middle of fiscal 2019, the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand prior to and after the hike will offset each other during that fiscal year -- although they will push down the growth rate for fiscal 2020 -- and that the effects of the decline in real income will be dispersed over fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020; (2) the increase in the consumption tax rate is smaller than that of the previous tax hike and a reduced tax rate will be applied to some items; (3) free education will be introduced and various measures to reduce the household burden of the tax hike as well as support measures to 40-30-20-10010203040-8-6-4-20246885909500051015 Tankan factor utilizationindex (right scale)%reversed, DI (\"excessive\"-\"insufficient\"), % pointsChart 4:Output GapSource:Bank of Japan.Notes: 1.

In fiscal 2019, Japan's economy is likely to grow at about the same pace as its potential, smooth out demand prior to and after the tax hike will be implemented; and (4) before the previous tax hike in April 2014, it was likely that a front-loaded increase in demand was seen not only in view of that hike but also in anticipation of the second round of the tax hike, which was supposed to take place in October 2015. It should be noted, however, that the impact of the consumption tax hike is uncertain and varies depending, for example, on developments in consumer sentiment. In addition, with respect to the guideline released by the government that allows firms to flexibly pass on the rise in the consumption tax to sales prices, it is difficult at this point to project its effects on factors such as firms' stance on how to deal with it. underpinned for the time being by the increase in that reflects a pick-up being, reflecting the effects of the slowdown in overseas economies, exports are projected to continue showing some weakness and the pace of increase in business fixed investment is likely consumption will likely increase clearly as the employment and income situation continues to improve, and also partly because of the increase hike. In addition, public investment is likely to exports are projected to return to their moderate increasing overseas economies rising gradually. As for housing investment are likely to be pushed down consumption tax hike. However, the rate of increase in business fixed investment is expected to rise somewhat, due in part to increases in to urban is to continue increasing.

Government spending is likely to maintain a relatively high level, mainly led although it is expected to decelerate as Olympic Games-related expenditure will have been completed. Household spending, such as private is projected to increase clearly, partly because the effects of the reactionary decline to the scheduled consumption tax hike are likely to dissipate. Meanwhile, exports are projected to continue their moderate increasing trend and business fixed investment also is likely to maintain its moderate Public investment has been more or less flat (Chart 6).

Moreover, since May, we have stopped operating on Fridays to further cut production (a general-purpose machinery company; Matsumoto).--In April, it looked like orders for household electrical appliances and on-board equipment for motor vehicles would recover in the second half of fiscal 2019, but since May, in the wake of announcements by the United States that it would impose additional tariffs on imports from China, it has become more likely that the recovery will take more time (an electronic parts and devices company; Sendai).--In order to avoid the impact of additional U.S. tariffs on imports from China, we have moved production to Japan for some products that were manufactured in China and shipped to the United States (a plastic products company; Okayama).--Orders have continued to decline, partly due to the slowdown in the Chinese economy. Moreover, as uncertainties regarding overseas economies recently have increased further, it is becoming difficult to predict when orders will recover. Therefore, we have reduced investment intended for capacity expansion from the level initially planned (a production machinery company; Kanazawa).--At the beginning of this fiscal year, our plans for fixed investment for fiscal 2019 were around the previous year's level, which was high, since we expected a recovery in demand for semiconductor parts in the period ahead. However, given the unpredictability of developments in the trade friction between the United States and China, we have decided to reduce our investment by about 20 percent from the initial plan (an electrical machinery company; Kofu).Source:Bank of Japan.Notes: 1.

Meanwhile, when there is a front-loaded increase in demand, inventories are drawn down, and thus inventory adjustments push down GDP. In addition, part of the front-loaded increase in demand brings about a rise in imports, which are deducted from GDP, and this consequently pushes down GDP. These developments in inventories and imports are expected to reduce the fluctuations in overall GDP brought about by the tax hike. same pace as that prior to the previous tax hike, increase is attributable to some extent to an increase in services consumption reflecting a rise in travel demand associated with the long holiday therefore is not only due to the front-loaded increase in demand. Looking at developments by type of consumption and focusing on durable goods, which are more susceptible demand can be observed in some items, but the overall degree of the increase is limited compared Taking a more detailed look, while sales of automobiles have been recently, partly due to supply constraints, the is accelerating somewhat.

Taking the labor force participation rates by gender and age as given, the overall labor force participation rate should have continued to show recent years.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to decelerate, with a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately as the output gap improves and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rates are more or less unchanged. The projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 is significantly higher, mainly due to the fact that cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have been passed on to consumer prices to a greater extent than expected. The projected rates of increase in this CPI for fiscal 2024 and 2025 are more or less unchanged. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 and 2024. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 27 and 28, 2023. Japan's economy has recovered moderately. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has improved moderately. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has increased steadily at a moderate pace, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is slower than a while ago, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures, but it has been in the range of 3.0-3.5 percent recently owing to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Inflation expectations have shown some upward movements again. For the time being, Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately, supported by the materialization of pent-up demand, as well as by factors such as it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a slowdown in the pace of In the household sector, employment is likely to rise on the back of a recovery in economic activity. In addition, the rate of increase in nominal wages per employee is expected to accelerate as it gradually reflects the results of this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, which show that the wage growth rate agreed in the negotiations was significantly higher than in the previous year, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be affected by price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately. This is because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions, and because factors such as improvement in consumer sentiment, which mainly reflects a rise in wage growth, are expected to provide support. Private consumption is also likely to be underpinned by the government's measures, such as those to reduce the household In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies resulting mainly from the impact they are likely to be more or less flat due to factors such as a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. With economic activity continuing to recover, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, partly due to a waning of the impact of past high raw material costs and to progress in the pass-through of cost increases to selling prices. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support and the effects of supply-side constraints wane, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Regarding the outlook for Japan's economy after these developments, it is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period due to a In the household sector, employment is projected to continue rising, but the pace of increase is likely to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an recovery. In this situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Supported by the rise in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing, although the pace of increase is likely to decelerate as the materialization of pent-up demand slows In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to keep waning. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is projected to continue increasing. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase steadily. Meanwhile, public investment is likely to keep increasing moderately for the time being, partly due to the effects of large-scale projects. Thereafter, although these effects are projected to gradually dissipate, public investment is expected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19 and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with the The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increases led by the past rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately as the output gap improves and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. is significantly higher, mainly due to the fact that cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have been passed on to consumer prices to a greater extent than expected. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher electricity and gas charges are expected to push down the year-on-year For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are likely to push up the rate due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of change is projected to be at around 3 percent for fiscal 2023 and then be in the range of 1.5-2.0 percent for fiscal The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to turn positive around the middle of fiscal 2023 and expand moderately toward the end of the projection period, albeit at a gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have shown some upward movements again. that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has been at a high level, and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has also been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. In addition, the wage growth rate agreed in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations this year was significantly higher than in the previous year, including base pay. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. In this situation, signs of change have been seen in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Regarding the outlook, even as actual inflation decelerates, inflation expectations are likely to rise negotiations. This will likely lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to raise their policy interest rates. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow, albeit at a moderate pace. That said, vigilance against the risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases has remained high, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. With the continuing impact of policy interest rate hikes, there is also a risk that global financial conditions will tighten emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. Meanwhile, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets. The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the area, could heighten. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, there are extremely high uncertainties regarding the outlook, such as over geopolitical factors -- particularly the situation surrounding Ukraine -- and the effects of efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. It is expected in the baseline scenario that the terms of trade will improve, but if they were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income and lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward households. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. The third factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these changes, their medium- to long-term growth expectations, the potential growth rate, and the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, with Japan's economy following a recovery trend and against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by competitors, and these moves have continued to spread. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through to consumer prices could continue for longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario to a greater extent than can be explained by changes in the output gap, as moves to reflect not only price developments in wage setting but also wage developments in price setting become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with prices of commodities, including grains, declining on the whole, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could decline through the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation, and this could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although the wage growth rate agreed in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations this year was significantly higher than in the previous year, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected from next year and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to decelerate, with a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately. Although it will take time, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay on Japan's economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 and 2024. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, even in the markets, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain the stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in April 2023 Forecasts made in April 2023 Forecasts made in April 2023 Notes: 1.

It is also possible that will have a significant gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately for the time being, supported by the materialization of pent-up is expected to exert Although goods exports are projected to be affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies, they are likely to be more or less flat for the time being, due to factors such constraints. Thereafter, goods exports are likely to economies gradually picking up. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is projected to keep increasing as travel fixed is also expected to continue increasing, with corporate profits improving on the investment that had been postponed during the is likely to rise on the back of a recovery in growth is expected to accelerate as it gradually reflects the results of this year's annual spring show that the wage growth rate agreed in the negotiations was significantly higher than in the previous year, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, nominal employee income is likely to continue rising. Moreover, downward pressure on households' real income stemming from high prices is projected to ease gradually, since it is expected that the effects of pushing down energy will continue for the time being, and that there will be a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. In this situation, private consumption is projected to continue increasing moderately. This is because pent-up demand is to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a consumer sentiment, which mainly reflects a rise in wage growth, are expected to provide support. Government spending is expected to decline, reflecting a reduction in expenditure related to COVID-19, although it is likely to be supported by in construction related healthcare and nursing care expenditures. government's economic measures are likely to wane, Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies picking up and being maintained. Goods exports are likely to increase economies. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is also expected to continue increasing, including digital-related investment, investment related to investment associated with strengthening supply employee income is likely to continue increasing steadily. This is because wage growth is expected to remain relatively high, although it will gradually become more difficult for labor supply to increase, seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. In this situation, private consumption is likely to continue increasing moderately, although it is projected that a waning of the effects of the government's economic measures pushing down prices of the previous year will push down real demand will gradually wane. Government spending is expected to turn to a moderate related to building national resilience and an demand is expected to continue increasing, the growth pace of Japan's economy is likely to slow somewhat, mainly because pent-up demand is expected to diminish.

With progress in construction based on the government's economic measures, including construction related to building national resilience, the amount of public construction completed -- a coincident indicator of public investment -- has increased. Recently, the effects of large-scale projects have also made a positive contribution. The value of public works contracted and orders received for public construction -- both of which are leading indicators of public investment -- saw have decreased somewhat.

The mode is the inflation rate with the highest density in the price change distribution. The weighted median is the average of the inflation rates of the items at around the 50 percentile point of the cumulative distribution in terms of weight. All three indicators are calculated using data for each CPI item that excludes the effects of the consumption tax hikes, policies concerning the provision of free education, and travel subsidy programs. 13 In this report, the mode is defined as the inflation rate with the highest density in the distribution that is estimated parametrically by fitting a normal inverse Gaussian distribution to the observed price change distribution in each period. It should be noted that, of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been at around 3 percent recently. The weighted is developments in certain CPI items, has been at around 1.5 percent. Looking at the year-on-year the share of price-decreasing items has been at a high level as costs, such as of raw materials, have been passed on to a wide range of goods and domestic demand deflator has been in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent (Chart 35). By component, the private consumption deflator has been at around 3 percent on a year-on-year basis. The rates of increase in such deflators as for business fixed investment have remained at high levels despite slowing somewhat.

Starting from June 2023, the government has gradually lowered the gasoline subsidy rate applied when the nationwide average exceeds the benchmark by no more than 25 yen per liter, and will terminate the overall subsidies at the end of September.

In addition, recently, price rises are spreading to items for which a pass-through of cost increases has been contained even during the current period of concentration (Chart B2-5). The background to such changes in firms' behavior is that (1) final demand has been firm, partly supported by many firms have had no choice but to consider raising prices in the face of the upward pressure of costs, it has become less difficult, in terms of competition, for firms to pass on cost increases to their selling prices.20 It is necessary to continue paying pass-through of cost increases becomes more prolonged or intensifies with firms shifting their price-setting stance further toward raising prices. 20 Regarding nonlinear change in firms' price-setting behavior in the current phase, see the following: Box 3 in the October 2022 Outlook Report, and \"Firms' Recent Price-Setting Stance: Evidence from the Tankan,\" Bank of Japan Review Series, no. 23-E-2, February 2023. 40-30-20-1001020304050070911131517192123 CY 2020=100CY The year-on-year rates of change in the CPI have risen globally in the current phase (Chart B3-1).

Thereafter, however, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, mainly due to the widespread vaccinations, the economy is likely to recover, supported by an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures.

In particular, there are high uncertainties over whether the resumption of economic activity can progress smoothly while public health is being protected. Attention also should be paid to a risk that the effects of supply-side constraints seen in some areas will be amplified or prolonged. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 27 and 28, 2021. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase as a trend, despite being weak recently due to the effects of supply-side constraints seen in some areas. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have continued to improve on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. Private consumption has shown signs of a pick-up recently, although downward pressure has remained strong, particularly on services consumption, mainly due to vigilance against COVID-19. Housing investment has picked up. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the same hereafter) has been at around 0 percent, mainly due to the rise in energy prices, despite being affected by COVID-19 and a reduction in mobile phone charges. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have picked up. The outlook for Japan's economy is that, for the time being, downward pressure stemming from COVID-19 is likely to remain on services consumption, and exports and production are expected to decelerate temporarily due to supply-side constraints. Thereafter, however, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, mainly due to the widespread vaccinations, the economy is likely to recover, supported by the increase in external In the corporate sector, a virtuous cycle is projected to continue operating, in which increases in exports and production that reflect steady external demand lead to a rise in business fixed investment, mainly through improvement in profits. In the household sector, it is highly likely that overall private consumption will pick up again because downward pressure on the face-to-face services sector is expected to gradually wane as the resumption of consumption activities progresses while public health is being protected, mainly due to the widespread vaccinations. Therefore, with improvement spreading from the corporate sector to the household sector, the recovery trend in the overall economy is projected to become pronounced. From the middle of the projection period, although the pace of economic growth is likely to decelerate somewhat, mainly reflecting a peaking-out of pent-up demand at home and abroad, the economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate because the virtuous cycle from income to spending is expected to intensify in the overall economy, including the household sector, supported by accommodative financial Looking at the outlook for economic activity in more detail, as the impact of COVID-19 wanes gradually, overseas economies are likely to continue growing, albeit with variation across countries and regions, supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies taken mainly in advanced economies. In this situation, although Japan's exports of goods, mainly automobile-related ones, are expected to decelerate temporarily due to the effects of supply-side constraints, they are projected to continue increasing as a trend on the tourism consumption, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry and travel restrictions continue but likely to recover thereafter. Corporate profits are projected to continue on an improving trend on the back of a recovery in domestic and external demand, despite being affected by deterioration in the terms of trade that reflects a rise in international commodity prices and by supply-side constraints. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear, mainly for machinery and digital-related investments, supported by sector is projected to remain weak for the time being. Private consumption, despite being restrained for the time being, mainly by vigilance against COVID-19, is expected to pick up again, supported by the materialization of progresses while public health is being protected, mainly due to the widespread private consumption is projected to become evident, supported by improvement in employee income. Employee income is likely to increase moderately on the back of a rise in the number of employees that reflects the recovery in domestic and external demand Public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is likely to increase clearly for fiscal 2021, mainly reflecting a pick-up in healthcare expenditure and enhancement of the testing and vaccination systems and the medical treatment system, but see a lowering in its level Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately, mainly on the back of capital stock growth due to the rise in business fixed investment.2 These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's measures to transform the economic The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase moderately in positive territory for the time being. That is, although the rate is projected to continue to be pushed down relatively significantly by the reduction in mobile phone charges, it is expected to increase toward around the end of 2021, mainly due to the rise in energy prices reflecting year's decline brought about by the \"Go To Travel\" campaign. When various temporary factors are excluded, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to remain steady and continue to show a moderate increase in positive territory. the reduction in mobile phone charges, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to increase gradually as a trend, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap -- which captures the utilization of labor and capital -- has been negative recently, it is projected to turn positive with the economy returning to a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, and continue to expand moderately from the middle of the projection period. Under these circumstances, as households' tolerance of price rises improves moderately, mainly reflecting an increase in wage inflation, and as firms' price-setting stance gradually becomes active, the pass-through of cost increases and a rise in selling prices are likely to become widely observed. In addition, the increase in actual inflation is expected to lead to a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations through the adaptive formation mechanism and thereby encourage Curve Control. It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March 2020 in response to the impact of COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. The government has 2 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be at around 0 percent or marginally positive. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms. Private financial institutions have actively fulfilled the functioning of financial intermediation. In this situation, although firms' financial positions have improved on the whole, mainly due to a pick-up in economic activity, weakness has remained, particularly for firms in industries facing subdued sales due to the impact of COVID-19, as well as small and medium-sized ones. and corporate bonds, has remained accommodative. On the back of financial system stability being maintained, the Bank considers that financial conditions will remain government's measures, and efforts made by private financial institutions, and that this will support an increase in private demand.3 Regarding the upside and downside risks to the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay attention to the following factors. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on consumption activities. There are high specifically regarding people's vigilance against COVID-19 and its impact on consumption variants, there is a risk that economic activity will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, economic activity could improve by more than expected because if, for example, public health is protected and people's vigilance lessens pent-up demand for services consumption will materialize relatively early. The second factor is the effects of supply-side constraints. Mainly due to a rapid recovery COVID-19 in Asia, supply-side constraints have been seen globally, including the procurement difficulties reflecting supply-chain disruptions. As the impact of COVID-19 wanes, demand imbalances and production and shipping bottlenecks are likely to head toward a resolution. However, if the effects of supply-side constraints are prolonged or amplified by more than expected, there is a risk that economic activity will deviate further 3 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. The third factor is developments in overseas economies. The growth rates of overseas economies are projected to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period, mainly reflecting further normalization of those economies and the peaking-out of economic stimulus measures taken in advanced economies. However, there is a risk that overseas economies, particularly emerging economies, will deviate downward from the baseline scenario if global financial conditions tighten by more than expected amid some emerging economies and over steps toward reducing monetary accommodation in activities, could be pushed up through, for example, rapid spending of household savings that have accumulated significantly across economies due to various restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. While it is likely that the economic structure and working style will be transformed toward the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization will see further advances, and efforts to address climate change will proceed, there are uncertainties over whether these developments raise or lower such If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is uncertainties over firms' price-setting behavior. In the baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, as described earlier, it is projected that firms' price-setting stance will gradually become active with continuing improvement in the output gap. That said, given, in Japan is complex and sticky, firms' price-setting behavior in the future entails uncertainties, including a risk that the pass-through of cost increases to selling prices, particularly to downstream or consumer prices, which are closer to final demand, will not The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Thus, it is necessary to continue paying attention to In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. Although it will take time, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19 and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In particular, there are high uncertainties over whether the resumption of economic activity can progress smoothly while public health is being protected. Attention also should be paid to the risk that the effects of supply-side constraints seen in some areas will be amplified or prolonged. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole, despite the fact that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on economic and financial activity at home and abroad. In addition, even in the case of a future resurgence of COVID-19, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Accordingly, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items excluding fresh food for the April-June quarter of 2021 was revised downward by around 0.7 percentage points; namely, from around 0.1 percent (2015-base) to minus 0.6 percent (2020-base). This is mainly because the negative contribution of mobile phone charges to the CPI expanded from around 0.6 percentage points to around 1.1 percentage points. The changes to the CPI forecasts in this Outlook Report from the previous ones are largely attributable to the rebasing of the CPI. 2.0-1.00.01.02.0-2.0-1.00.01.02.02015201620172018201920202021202220232024 FY 5.0-4.0-3.0-2.0-1.00.01.02.03.04.0-5.0-4.0-3.0-2.0-1.00.01.02.03.04.02015201620172018201920202021202220232024 FY Notes: 1.

While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that, with a growing sense of labor shortage, the output gap will improve and medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. Through fiscal 2025, rice prices are likely to be at high levels and the effects of the government's measures pushing down inflation will dissipate, and these factors are expected to make a positive contribution to the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food). \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rates are more or less unchanged. The projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 and 2025 are higher, reflecting the rise in rice prices and the higher import prices stemming from factors such as the recent depreciation of the yen. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. In particular, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2024 and 2025. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 23 and 24, 2025. Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. Overseas economies have grown moderately on the whole. Exports and industrial production have been more or less flat. Corporate profits have been on an improving trend and business sentiment has stayed at a favorable level. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has been on a moderate increasing trend despite the impact of price rises and other factors. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been at around 3 percent recently, as services prices have continued to rise moderately, reflecting factors such as wage increases, and as the government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher energy prices have been scaled back, although the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have waned. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies continuing to grow moderately and as a virtuous cycle from income The projected real GDP growth rates are more or less unchanged from those presented in In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased situation, nominal wages are expected to keep increasing clearly, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Against this backdrop, for the time being, although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately, mainly reflecting the rise in wage growth. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned, for the time being, by the 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and, with regard to the future conduct of policy, referring to views incorporated in financial markets that the policy interest rate will rise moderately. government's initiatives such as the continuation of measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline and other prices, despite these measures being scaled back. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend, mainly due to a recovery in global demand for IT-related goods, as overseas economies continue to grow moderately. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend with a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat. Government consumption is expected to increase moderately in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be in the around 2 percent for fiscal 2026. While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that, with a growing sense of labor shortage, the output gap will improve and medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. Through fiscal 2025, rice prices are likely to be at high levels and the effects of the government's measures pushing down inflation will dissipate, and these factors are expected to make a positive 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be around 0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are high uncertainties over how factors such as advances in digitalization will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 and 2025 are higher, reflecting the rise in rice prices and the higher import prices stemming from factors such as the recent depreciation of the yen. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges had pushed down 2023. For fiscal 2024 and 2025, the phasing out of these measures is projected to push up the rates. Looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to be at around 2 percent, mainly because services and other prices are expected to continue rising moderately, reflecting factors such as wage increases, and rice prices are likely to rise, although the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are projected to wane gradually. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend, albeit with fluctuations. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to widen moderately within positive territory toward the end of the projection period. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have tightened to a greater extent than can be explained by the changes in the output gap, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors. In this situation, upward pressure on wages and prices is likely to be stronger than suggested by the output gap, given that firms in many industries have started to face labor supply constraints. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. Firms' inflation outlook has increased moderately. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and nominal wages have increased clearly. In addition, with wages continuing to rise, there has been an increase in moves to reflect higher costs, such as increased personnel expenses and distribution costs, in selling prices. Regarding the outlook, with labor market conditions remaining tight, inflation expectations are expected to rise moderately, as changes in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior are likely to continue. Under these circumstances, the virtuous cycle between wages and prices is projected to keep intensifying through achievement of wage increases that reflect price rises and through a pass-through of wage increases to selling prices. With regard to this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, there have been many views expressed by firms stating that they will continue to raise wages steadily, following the solid wage increases last year. Considering the above assessments, with a growing sense of labor shortage, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, mainly reflecting the improvement in the of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. That said, there remain uncertainties regarding this outlook, and it is necessary to carefully monitor factors such as firms' wage- and Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. While attention has been drawn to uncertainties surrounding policy conduct in the United States, the U.S. economy has been solid, and global financial and capital markets have been stable on the whole. However, attention continues to be warranted on the possibility that these uncertainties surrounding policy conduct will have global economy and global financial and capital markets. In addition, in the United States and Europe, uncertainties remain regarding the impact of past policy interest rate hikes. Meanwhile, depending on factors such as the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine and the Middle East, downward pressure on overseas economies could heighten. Regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of growth, as adjustment pressure has continued in the real estate and labor markets, and it is necessary to pay attention to how excessive supply capacity of some goods will affect The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, including grains. Attention continues to be warranted on the risk that prices of grains and other commodities will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. Moreover, with progress in the pass-through of the rise in import strengthen further, and this could push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is the impact of various changes in the environment surrounding Japan on firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations and on Japan's potential growth rate. It is expected that factors such as the experience of COVID-19, intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization and on labor market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Intensifying labor shortages -- which are partly due to demographic changes -- could accelerate labor-saving investment, such as for digitalization. On the other hand, if such a substitution of labor with capital does not sufficiently progress, there is a risk that supply-side constraints in some industries will push down the growth rate. Furthermore, factors such as heightened geopolitical risks and growing trade frictions could change the trend of globalization. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and it is expected in the baseline scenario that the virtuous cycle between wages and prices will continue to intensify. However, given that firms, especially small and medium-sized firms, have continued to report that it has been difficult to pass on their employees' higher wages to their selling prices, it will be necessary to pay close attention to whether moves to pass on increases in costs, including wages, to selling prices will weaken with the waning of the effects of the pass-through of import prices to consumer prices. On the other hand, moves to reflect wages in selling prices could strengthen to a greater extent than expected, and upward pressure on wages could intensify with growing expectations that labor market conditions will continue to be tight. In this situation, there is also a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario, accompanied by a rise in medium- The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. In addition, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent for Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that, with a growing sense of labor shortage, the output gap will improve and medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with the virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There remain high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2024 and 2025. Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has generally not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities, although attention continues to be warranted on the pace of increase in stock and real estate prices. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. In addition, even in the case of an financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. Moreover, financial institutions' resilience to rises in yen interest rates has headed toward improvement, mainly reflecting 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" their portfolio rebalancing in securities investment. When examining financial imbalances such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close As for the conduct of monetary policy, while it will depend on developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions going forward, given that real interest rates are at significantly low levels, if the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized, the Bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation.

The projected rates of increase in this CPI for fiscal 2024 and 2025 are more or less unchanged. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior.

Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 and 2024. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 27 and 28, 2023. Japan's economy has recovered moderately. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has improved moderately. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has increased steadily at a moderate pace, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is slower than a while ago, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures, but it has been in the range of 3.0-3.5 percent recently owing to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Inflation expectations have shown some upward movements again. For the time being, Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately, supported by the materialization of pent-up demand, as well as by factors such as it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a slowdown in the pace of In the household sector, employment is likely to rise on the back of a recovery in economic activity. In addition, the rate of increase in nominal wages per employee is expected to accelerate as it gradually reflects the results of this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, which show that the wage growth rate agreed in the negotiations was significantly higher than in the previous year, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be affected by price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately. This is because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions, and because factors such as improvement in consumer sentiment, which mainly reflects a rise in wage growth, are expected to provide support. Private consumption is also likely to be underpinned by the government's measures, such as those to reduce the household In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies resulting mainly from the impact they are likely to be more or less flat due to factors such as a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. With economic activity continuing to recover, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, partly due to a waning of the impact of past high raw material costs and to progress in the pass-through of cost increases to selling prices. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support and the effects of supply-side constraints wane, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Regarding the outlook for Japan's economy after these developments, it is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period due to a In the household sector, employment is projected to continue rising, but the pace of increase is likely to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an recovery. In this situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Supported by the rise in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing, although the pace of increase is likely to decelerate as the materialization of pent-up demand slows In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to keep waning. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is projected to continue increasing. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase steadily. Meanwhile, public investment is likely to keep increasing moderately for the time being, partly due to the effects of large-scale projects. Thereafter, although these effects are projected to gradually dissipate, public investment is expected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19 and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with the The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increases led by the past rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately as the output gap improves and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. is significantly higher, mainly due to the fact that cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have been passed on to consumer prices to a greater extent than expected. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher electricity and gas charges are expected to push down the year-on-year For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are likely to push up the rate due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of change is projected to be at around 3 percent for fiscal 2023 and then be in the range of 1.5-2.0 percent for fiscal The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to turn positive around the middle of fiscal 2023 and expand moderately toward the end of the projection period, albeit at a gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have shown some upward movements again. that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has been at a high level, and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has also been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. In addition, the wage growth rate agreed in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations this year was significantly higher than in the previous year, including base pay. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. In this situation, signs of change have been seen in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Regarding the outlook, even as actual inflation decelerates, inflation expectations are likely to rise negotiations. This will likely lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to raise their policy interest rates. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow, albeit at a moderate pace. That said, vigilance against the risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases has remained high, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. With the continuing impact of policy interest rate hikes, there is also a risk that global financial conditions will tighten emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. Meanwhile, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets. The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the area, could heighten. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, there are extremely high uncertainties regarding the outlook, such as over geopolitical factors -- particularly the situation surrounding Ukraine -- and the effects of efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. It is expected in the baseline scenario that the terms of trade will improve, but if they were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income and lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward households. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. The third factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these changes, their medium- to long-term growth expectations, the potential growth rate, and the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, with Japan's economy following a recovery trend and against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by competitors, and these moves have continued to spread. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through to consumer prices could continue for longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario to a greater extent than can be explained by changes in the output gap, as moves to reflect not only price developments in wage setting but also wage developments in price setting become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with prices of commodities, including grains, declining on the whole, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could decline through the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation, and this could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although the wage growth rate agreed in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations this year was significantly higher than in the previous year, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected from next year and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to decelerate, with a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately. Although it will take time, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay on Japan's economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 and 2024. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, even in the markets, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain the stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in April 2023 Forecasts made in April 2023 Forecasts made in April 2023 Notes: 1.

The momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is maintained but is not yet sufficiently firm, and thus developments in prices continue to warrant careful attention. 1 The text of \"The Bank's View\" -- the outlook for economic activity and prices as well as the Bank's thinking on the conduct of monetary policy, both of which are based on individual Policy Board members' views -- was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 20 and 21, 2020. Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from have shown some weakness, mainly affected by the slowdown in overseas economies and natural disasters. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have continued to be observed. In this situation, exports have continued to show some weakness, and industrial production has declined recently, due partly to the effects of natural disasters. On the other hand, with corporate profits staying at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations due to improvement in the employment and income situation. Housing investment has been more or less flat, and public investment has increased moderately. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have remained tight. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. and the same hereafter) is at around 0.5 percent. Inflation expectations have been more With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend throughout the projection period -- that is, through fiscal 2021 -- as the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited, although the effects of the slowdown are likely to remain for the time being. In a situation where the growth pace of overseas economies will take some time to pick up, exports are projected to show some weakness for the time being. However, overseas economies are expected to grow moderately on the whole, with the growth rates rising on goods shifting toward a phase of improvement. Under these circumstances, Japan's exports are projected to return to their moderate increasing trend. Although domestic demand has declined recently, due mainly to the effects of the consumption tax hike and natural disasters, it is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household active government spending. Business fixed investment -- mainly investment related to research and development (R&D) investment for growth areas -- is likely to continue increasing moderately amid accommodative financial conditions, although the pace of increase is expected to decelerate temporarily, mainly for manufacturing, due to the capital stock are projected to exert downward pressure from a somewhat longer-term perspective. Private consumption is expected to follow a moderate increasing trend with such effects as of the consumption tax hike waning gradually and the employment and income situation continuing to improve. Meanwhile, government spending is expected to reflect the government's economic measures, in addition to Olympic Games-related demand; government spending thereafter is likely to remain at a relatively high level. Thus, the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited. On this basis, although Japan's economy has grown at a slower pace than its potential recently, it is expected to see an acceleration in its growth pace thereafter.2 Thus, on average, the economy is likely to continue growing at about the same pace as its potential or at a somewhat faster pace. Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected growth rates are higher, mainly for fiscal 2020, reflecting the effects of the Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, short- and long-term real interest rates are assumed to be in negative territory throughout the projection period as the Bank pursues \"Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control.\"3 Financial institutions' active lending attitudes, as well as favorable conditions for corporate bond and CP issuance, are likely to be maintained conditions are likely to remain highly accommodative. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to follow a moderate uptrend throughout the projection period against the backdrop of the following continuing developments: progress in implementation of the government's growth strategy, including regulatory and institutional reforms as well as measures to strengthen productivity, which are part of the strategy; and firms' fixed investment and efforts toward improving productivity. In addition, 2 Under a specific methodology, Japan's potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent recently. However, the estimate of the potential growth rate varies depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. Thus, it should be regarded as being subject to a considerable margin of error. 3 Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding future policy. Japan's economy, monetary easing effects are likely to be enhanced. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been positive but has continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and tight labor This is basically because firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance, as well as households' cautiousness toward price rises, have not yet clearly changed in a situation where the mindset and behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched. Firms' efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs by raising productivity, the technological progress in recent years, and the high wage elasticity of labor supply also are contributing factors. In addition, the continued lackluster developments in administered prices and housing rent are likely to have affected the sluggishness in prices. It has been taking time to resolve these factors that have been delaying price rises, and the situation likely has continued in which the responsiveness of prices to the output gap, as well as inflation expectations that are strongly affected by the adaptive formation mechanism, do not rise easily. With regard to the outlook, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising throughout the projection period, despite such effects as of the past decline in crude oil prices for the time being. Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected rates of increase in the CPI are more or less unchanged.4 gradually toward 2 percent can be explained by the following factors that determine general price inflation. First, although the output gap -- which shows the utilization of labor and capital -- recently seems to have narrowed within positive territory due to such effects as of the slowdown in overseas economies and the consumption tax hike, it is likely to growth rate is expected to exceed its potential somewhat. Under such circumstances, further price rises are likely to be observed widely as households' tolerance of price rises 4 Taking into account the actual CPI figures for October and November 2019, the effect of the October 2019 consumption tax hike on the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for October 2019 onward is estimated to be 1.0 percentage point; the effects for fiscal 2019 and 2020 are estimated to be 0.5 percentage point for each fiscal year. In addition, based on a specific assumption, the effects of policies concerning the provision of free education on the year-on-year rates of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2019 and 2020 are estimated to be around minus 0.3 percentage point and around minus 0.4 percentage point, respectively. increases, mainly reflecting a rise in wage growth rates, and as firms' stance shifts toward further raising prices. Second, medium- to long-term inflation expectations have remained more or less unchanged. As for the outlook, such expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend and gradually converge to 2 percent on the back of the following: (1) in terms of the adaptive component, a rise in the observed inflation rate is likely to push up inflation expectations, and (2) in terms of the forward-looking component, the Bank will pursue monetary easing through its strong commitment to achieving the price stability target, which will be effective in pushing up inflation expectations.5 Third, regarding import prices, the past decline in crude oil prices is likely to push down the CPI through the fall in energy prices for the time being. However, such downward pressure is projected to diminish gradually. strengthening of efforts toward improving productivity, are expected to increase upward pressure on prices in the long term. Specifically, as the growth potential of the economy as a whole rises, reflecting such moves, firms' and households' spending behavior can be expected to become active. The following four factors are upside and downside risks to the Bank's baseline scenario regarding the economy. The first is developments in overseas economies. Specifically, the following are considered as risks: the consequences of protectionist moves and their effects; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies such as China; concerning overseas economies seem to be still significant, although they have decreased somewhat compared to a while ago, and it also is necessary to pay close 5 Medium- to long-term inflation expectations can be regarded as consisting of two components: a forward-looking component, in which inflation expectations converge to the price stability target set by the central bank, and a backward-looking, or adaptive, component that reflects the observed inflation rate. For details, see the Bank's Comprehensive Assessment: Developments in Economic Activity and Prices as well as Policy Effects since the Introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) released in September 2016. The second risk is the effects of the consumption tax hike conducted in October 2019. Fluctuations in demand prior to and after the tax hike seem to have been constrained this time compared with those of the previous tax hike in April 2014, partly due to various measures implemented by the government. Although the impact of a decline in real income is expected to be smaller than that of the previous tax hike, it continues to warrant attention as it is likely to depend on consumer sentiment, the employment and income Third, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations may be either raised or lowered depending on the following: efforts to address medium- to long-term issues such as the declining birthrate and aging population; developments in regulatory declines, the economy may deviate downward from the baseline scenario through increasing concerns regarding the future and the rises in long-term interest rates associated with them. On the other hand, there also is a possibility that the economy will deviate upward from the baseline scenario if confidence in the path toward fiscal consolidation strengthens and concerns regarding the future are alleviated. As mentioned above, with regard to risks to economic activity, the downside risks concerning overseas economies in particular seem to be still significant. If these risks materialize, close attention should be paid to the possibility that prices also will be affected In addition, the specific factors that could exert upside and downside risks to prices are as follows. The first is developments in firms' and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Although inflation expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend, there is a risk that a rise in such expectations will be delayed through the adaptive formation mechanism if it takes longer than projected for firms' stance to shift toward further raising wages and prices and actual inflation consequently remains relatively sluggish. The second factor is the responsiveness of prices to the output gap. If firms' efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs by raising productivity continue for a long time, or stemming from these factors may last longer than expected. In addition, the lackluster developments in administered prices and housing rent also may continue to constrain the Third, developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices going forward, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices, may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent. Although it is necessary to carefully examine the risks to economic activity and prices, the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent appears to be maintained. This is because (1) firms' stance is expected to gradually shift toward further raising wages and prices with the output gap remaining positive, and (2) medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged and are projected to rise gradually as further price rises come to be observed widely. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. With regard to the outlook for economic activity, risks are skewed to the downside, particularly regarding developments in overseas economies. Regarding the outlook for prices, risks are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the long-term inflation expectations. Although there has been no further increase in the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost, it is necessary to continue to pay close attention to the possibility. Examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, there is no sign so far of excessively bullish prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, with the low interest rate environment and severe competition among financial institutions continuing, could create risks of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation and of destabilizing the financial system. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary 6 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for the policy rates, the Bank expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. It will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. In particular, in a situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies, are significant, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.

In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target.

In particular, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2025. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 30 and 31, 2024. Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. Overseas economies have grown moderately on the whole. Exports and industrial production have been more or less flat. Corporate profits have improved and business sentiment has stayed at a favorable level. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has been on a moderate increasing trend despite the impact of price rises and other factors. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been less fresh food) has been at around 2.5 percent recently, as services prices have continued to rise moderately, reflecting factors such as wage increases, although the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have waned. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies continuing to grow moderately and as a virtuous cycle from income The projected real GDP growth rates are more or less unchanged from those presented in In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased situation, nominal wages are expected to keep increasing clearly, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Against this backdrop, for the time being, although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately, mainly reflecting the rise in wage growth. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned, for the time being, by the government's initiatives such as the continuation of measures to reduce the household 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and, with regard to the future conduct of policy, referring to views incorporated in financial markets that the policy interest rate will rise moderately. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend, mainly due to a recovery in global demand for IT-related goods, as overseas economies continue to grow moderately. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend with a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat. Government consumption is expected to increase moderately in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. Through fiscal 2025, it is also expected that a dissipation of the effects of the government's measures pushing down inflation will make a positive contribution to the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI other resource prices will make a negative contribution. Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2025 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are high uncertainties over how factors such as advances in digitalization will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. is somewhat lower due to factors such as the recent decline in crude oil and other The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges had pushed down 2023. For fiscal 2024 and 2025, the phasing out of these measures is projected to push up the rates. Looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to be at around 2 percent, as services and other prices are expected to continue rising moderately, reflecting factors such as wage increases, although the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are projected to wane gradually. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend, albeit with fluctuations. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to widen moderately within positive territory toward the end of the projection period. Meanwhile, labor market conditions are expected to tighten to a greater extent than can be explained by the changes in the output gap, partly due to a deceleration in the on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. Firms' inflation outlook has increased moderately. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and nominal wages have increased clearly. In addition, moves to reflect wage increases in selling prices have continued to strengthen. Regarding the outlook, inflation expectations are expected to rise moderately, with behavior. Under these circumstances, the virtuous cycle between wages and prices is projected to keep intensifying through achievement of wage increases that reflect price rises and through a pass-through of wage increases to selling prices. Considering the above assessments, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, mainly reflecting the improvement in the output gap and the rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations; in the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. That said, there remain uncertainties regarding this outlook, and it is necessary to carefully monitor factors such Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Inflation rates in the United States and Europe have followed a declining trend, albeit with fluctuations, and central banks in these economies have started to lower policy interest rates. In this situation, the U.S. and European economies are likely to avoid significant slowdowns. That said, there are uncertainties over how past policy interest rate hikes by overseas central banks will affect their real economies and financial systems. There is also a risk of fluctuations widening in financial and foreign exchange markets depending on the pace of economic slowdown and due to expectations regarding central banks' policy conduct. It is necessary to take these risks Meanwhile, depending on factors such as the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine and the Middle East, downward pressure on overseas economies could heighten. In addition, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of growth, as adjustment pressure has continued in the real estate and labor markets, and it is necessary to pay attention to how inventory adjustment pressure on some goods will affect overseas economic activity and prices. The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, including grains. Attention continues to be warranted on the risk that prices of grains and other commodities will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. If the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. Moreover, with progress in the pass-through of the rise in import strengthen further, and this could push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is the impact of various changes in the environment surrounding Japan on firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations and on Japan's potential growth rate. It is expected that factors such as the experience of COVID-19, intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization and on labor market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Intensifying labor shortages -- which are partly due to demographic changes -- could accelerate labor-saving investment, such as for digitalization. On the other hand, if such a substitution of labor with capital does not sufficiently progress, there is a risk that supply-side constraints in some industries will push down the growth rate. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. While firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, there remain uncertainties over the extent to which moves to reflect wage developments in selling prices will become widespread. It is expected in the baseline scenario that the virtuous cycle between wages and prices will continue to intensify. However, given that firms, especially small and medium-sized firms, have continued to report that it has been difficult to pass on their employees' higher wages to their selling prices, the rise in selling prices could be limited. Since the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in Japanese society for a prolonged period, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether moves to pass on increases in wages and other costs to selling prices will weaken with the waning of the effects of the pass-through of import prices to consumer prices. On the other hand, moves to reflect wages in selling prices could strengthen to a greater extent than expected, and upward pressure on wages could intensify with growing expectations that labor market conditions will continue to be tight. In this situation, there is also a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario, accompanied by a rise in medium- to long-term inflation The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. In addition, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with the virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There remain high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2025. Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has generally not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities, although attention continues to be warranted on the pace of increase in stock and real estate prices. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. In addition, even in the case of an financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. Moreover, financial institutions' resilience to rises in yen interest rates has headed toward improvement, mainly reflecting 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" their portfolio rebalancing in securities investment. When examining financial imbalances such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, while it will depend on developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions going forward, given that real interest rates are at significantly low levels, if the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized, the Bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. On this basis, the Bank needs to pay and developments in financial and capital markets. It also needs to examine how these factors will affect the outlook for Japan's economic activity and prices, the risks surrounding them, and the likelihood of realizing the outlook. With the price stability target of 2 percent, the Bank will conduct monetary policy as appropriate, in response to Forecasts made in July 2024 Forecasts made in July 2024 Forecasts made in July 2024 Notes: 1.

The projected rates of increase in the CPI are more or less unchanged. \uf06c The outlook for economic activity and prices provided in this Outlook Report is extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the assumption that COVID-19 will not spread again on such a large scale that the wide-ranging public health measures will need to be reinstated. It also is based on the premises that, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 28 and 29, 2020. Japan's economy has picked up with economic activity resuming, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies also have picked up from a state of significant depression. In this situation, exports and industrial production have increased. On the other hand, business fixed investment has been on a declining trend, against the background of deterioration in corporate profits. With the continuing impact of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has been weak. Private consumption has picked up gradually on the whole, accommodations, has remained at a low level. Housing investment has declined moderately. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Meanwhile, business sentiment deteriorated significantly but subsequently has improved somewhat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but those for corporate financing have remained less so, as seen in weakness in firms' financial positions. On the same hereafter) has been slightly negative, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign. Inflation expectations have weakened somewhat. gradually, is likely to follow an improving trend, supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures. However, the pace of improvement is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID-19 continues. Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth path. This baseline scenario is based on the assumptions that, with progress in efforts to take preventive measures against COVID-19 and improve economic activities simultaneously, COVID-19 will not spread again on such a large scale that the wide-ranging public health measures will need to be reinstated, and that the impact of COVID-19 will almost subside toward the end of the projection period. The outlook also is based on the premises that, in long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Looking at the outlook for economic activity based on the assumptions and premises in more detail, overseas economies are likely to continue improving, partly supported by vigilance against COVID-19 continues. Then, with the impact of COVID-19 almost subsiding, they are likely to continue improving toward the end of the projection period as the production activity of the manufacturing industry is projected to continue recovering globally and face-to-face services consumption in particular is expected to recover Japan's exports of goods are expected to increase for the time being, mainly for automobile-related goods, and then increase for a wide range of goods, including capital goods, with the impact of COVID-19 waning globally. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized as services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry restrictions continue, but is likely to recover thereafter along with a gradual easing in such restrictions. Private consumption is likely to continue picking up, supported also by the government's economic measures, but while vigilance against COVID-19 continues, the pace is expected to be quite moderate, mainly for face-to-face services consumption. Thereafter, with households and firms adapting to a \"new lifestyle\" and the impact of COVID-19 waning, an uptrend in private consumption is likely to become evident gradually, supported also by improvement in employee income. Although the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions are expected to support employment, the employment and income situation is projected to be under downward pressure for the time being against the background of deterioration in corporate profits and worsening labor market conditions. The employment and income situation is likely to turn to an improving trend thereafter, with domestic and external demand recovering. Business fixed investment is expected to remain on a declining trend for the time being, mainly in industries affected strongly by COVID-19. However, with accommodative financial conditions being maintained, it is expected that the capital stock adjustment will not be as significant as that seen at the time of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and that, with the impact of COVID-19 waning, business fixed investment will return to a moderate increasing trend along with improvement in corporate profits. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting the progress in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign.2 With economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of 2 The direct effects of the \"Go To Travel\" campaign on the CPI are estimated to be minus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2020 and 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2021, based on assumptions such as in terms of the period (i.e., from August 2020 through January 2021). COVID-19, it is expected that prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity will be pushed down. The past decline in crude oil prices also is projected to push down the CPI through energy prices. Under these circumstances, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to continue weakening somewhat. Thereafter, downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with prices are likely to dissipate. Under these circumstances, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are expected to rise again. Curve Control.\" It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March in response to COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets.3 In addition, the government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms, through programs that provide loans guaranteed by the credit guarantee corporations and also quasi-capital funds. institutions have actively fulfilled intermediation. In this situation, although firms' financial positions have been weak, the corporate bonds, has remained accommodative. Regarding financial markets, tension has eased, although they are still nervous. Owing to the Bank's and the government's measures, as well as efforts made by private financial institutions together with those measures, the Bank considers that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay 4 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are their impact on domestic and overseas economies. Until effective medicines and vaccines are developed, it is highly unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve and how long it will take for the impact to subside. In particular, if the wide-ranging public health measures are reinstated, economic activity is likely to be constrained significantly again. In addition, while vigilance against COVID-19 continues, households' and firms' behavior at home and abroad is uncertain, with people voluntarily making precautionary efforts. The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the impact of COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if the issue of COVID-19 leads to, for example, active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection and an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, thereby having positive The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although COVID-19 has affected the financial side as well, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively, with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation has been ensured.5 However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be Risks that are specific to prices are as follows. The first is uncertainties over firms' of economic activity. A decrease in demand due to constrained economic activity is likely to put downward pressure on prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity. On the other hand, since one of the reasons for the current decrease is vigilance against COVID-19, price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been observed widely to date. In addition, economic activity has been constrained also from the supply side, such as by limiting the number of customers to prevent infection. Under these circumstances, there are high uncertainties over how firms will set their prices and how this will affect general prices from a macro perspective. The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario, and thus continue to warrant attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. For the time being, downward pressure is expected to be put on prices with economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, and medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to weaken somewhat. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase gradually since downward pressure on them is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement. In addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the assumption that COVID-19 will not spread again on such a large scale that the wide-ranging public health measures will need to be reinstated. It also is based on the long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings 6 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady Specifically, goods exports are likely to continue increasing, mainly for automobile-related goods, and then do so for a wider range of goods, including capital goods, with 8 It is assumed that economic activity will be supported by the various measures included in the first supplementary budget for fiscal 2020, which is based on the Emergency Economic Measures to Cope with the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) -- with a project size of around 117.1 trillion yen and fiscal spending of around 48.4 trillion yen -- decided by the Cabinet in April 2020, and those included in the second supplementary budget -- with a project size of around 117.1 trillion yen and fiscal spending of around 72.7 trillion yen -- approved by the Diet in June 2020. demand, which is categorized as services exports, is expected to remain subdued as long as entry and travel restrictions continue, but is likely to is projected to continue picking up, backed by the government's measures to support income and stimulate demand, but the pace is highly likely to be quite moderate, mainly services, due to vigilance against COVID-19 and the need to keep social distancing. Thereafter, with households and firms adapting to a \"new uptrend in private consumption is likely to become evident gradually, supported also by improvement in employee income.

The employment and income situation is likely to turn to an improving trend thereafter, while lagging demand. Business fixed investment is projected to remain on a declining trend for the time being future. However, it is unlikely that the capital stock adjustment will be as significant as that seen at fixed is expected This is against the background of accommodative financial conditions being maintained owing to the efforts made by financial institutions together with those measures. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience.

Figures for the first half of fiscal 2020are those for 2020/Q2. 2020. However, the economy is likely to mark impact of COVID-19 is expected to wane, and then continue to grow firmly for fiscal 2022, mainly economies. Compared with projected growth rate is lower for fiscal 2020, demand, but is somewhat higher for fiscal 2021 The potential growth rate seems to have declined to around 0 percent recently (Chart 3). This is largely because total factor productivity (TFP) has declined, mainly due to preventive measures working hours have been on a downtrend due to hours. For the time being, although the downtrend in working hours is likely to slow its pace, the potential growth rate is expected to remain at business fixed investment is likely to cause said, the rate is expected to rise moderately toward the end of the projection period. This is based on the projection that, (1) the TFP growth reflecting adaptation to lifestyle changes that were caused stock will accelerate cyclically. However, there is a that COVID-19 will bring about structural changes in people's working styles and widespread adoption of working from home and changes could lead to a trend that is different from the past one. Thus, the output gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with more latitude than usual. In addition, there are high uncertainties at this point which are assumed to bring about a future rise in Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In the second half of fiscal 2020, with COVID-19 waning gradually, the economy is expected to continue picking up, mainly for pressure is expected to remain strong in the mainly for automobile-related goods, are likely to increasing, partly supported by inbound tourism demand, which is categorized as is expected restrictions to prevent COVID-19. Backed by the government's measures to support income and is projected to continue picking up with an increase COVID-19 being constrained and restrictions on business activities, including holding of events, being eased gradually. However, the pace of increase in private consumption is likely to be while people, seniors in particular, continue to be vigilant with regard to going out or contacting with others, and while social distancing remains a constraint on the supply side. Business fixed investment is projected to remain on a declining trend, with an increasing number of non-urgent projects being postponed against the background investment is expected to continue increasing related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national government consumption is likely to decelerate compared with fiscal 2019, mainly due to a drop in overseas economies rise, an improving trend in Japan's economy is expected to become evident, partly supported by accommodative conditions. Exports, including those of capital goods and IT-related goods, are expected to continuing to wane, private consumption is likely to increase, albeit moderately, supported also by fixed investment is expected to turn to an uptrend, commercial facilities and hotels, is likely to remain at a low level. This is because, with corporate profits improving, business fixed investment is projected to be pushed up by an undertaking of postponed investment projects and an increase in digital-related investment to set up systems for government spending is likely to be at a high level, supported by expenditure on disaster-related related to the Olympic Games. In fiscal 2022, the economy is expected to continue growing firmly, with demand at home and abroad increasing in a well-balanced manner. Exports are likely to continue increasing clearly, reflecting improvement in overseas economies. In this situation, corporate profits are expected to follow their improving trend. Regarding business fixed investment, machinery investment is likely to see an acceleration in its growth pace, and also are likely to continue increasing.

Turning to a breakdown by industry, business fixed investment has been decreasing in both the recently, but it is highly likely that investment in the manufacturing industry will pick up relatively early.

In the meantime, institutions have made progress addressing COVID-19, mainly in metropolitan confirmed severe cases has been constrained.

As for the outlook, it is consumption will be only moderate, with spending behavior, mainly by seniors, continuing to be cautious. However, given that consumer behavior under the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have been changing recently, the pick-up trend in face-to-face services consumption is projected to continue for the time being, supported also by the effects of demand stimulus measures including the \"Go To\" campaign (covering such areas as travel, dining out, and events). COVID-19 has affected the financial side. With a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets, the Bank has actively made responses by conducting the following without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing conducting COVID-19: total size of about 130 tril. yen + \u03b1 outstanding of about 20 tril. yen at maximum (previous Financing in Response to COVID-19: about 110 tril. yen Further active purchases of JGBs and T-Bills: unlimited Operations: unlimited \u2192 annual pace with the upper limit of about 12 tril. yen (for the time being) \u2192 annual pace with the upper limit of about 180 bil. yen (for the time being) J-REITs: annual pace of about 90 bil. yen Supporting Corporate Financing Special Program to Support Financing in Response to \u3000Purchases of CP and corporate bonds: amount amount outstanding of about 5 tril. yen) Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Stabilizing Financial Markets Ample and Flexible Provision of Yen and Foreign Currency Funds Enhancement of the U.S. Dollar Funds-Supplying Active Purchases of ETFs and J-REITs ETFs: annual pace of about 6 tril. yen These measures have had positive effects.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023, with a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately, albeit with fluctuations, as the output gap improves and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as firms' price- and wage-setting behavior. \uf06c Comparing the projections through fiscal 2024 with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rates for fiscal 2022 and 2023 are lower, mainly due to a lower projection for private consumption, but the projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is more or less unchanged. The projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 and 2024 are somewhat higher, mainly due to a higher projection for wages. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices as well as developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on April 27 and 28, 2023. Japan's economy has picked up, despite being affected by factors such as past high commodity prices. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has been more or less unchanged. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole. Private consumption has increased moderately, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some fresh food) is slower than a while ago, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures, but it has been at around 3 percent recently owing to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently after rising. Toward around the middle of fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is likely to recover moderately, supported by the materialization of pent-up demand, as well as by factors such as it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from past high commodity prices In the household sector, regarding the employment situation, the number of both regular and non-regular employees is likely to rise on the back of improvement in economic activity. In addition, wage growth is expected to increase, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be affected by price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately. This is mainly because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions. Private consumption is also likely to be underpinned by the government's measures such as those to reduce the In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies resulting mainly from the impact they are likely to be more or less flat due to factors such as a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Although past high raw material costs are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at continued improvement in economic activity. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support and the effects of supply-side constraints wane, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor investment associated with strengthening supply chains. From the second half of fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at gradually intensifies in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period due to a waning of the In the household sector, employment is projected to continue increasing, but the pace of increase is likely to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an recovery. In this situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Supported by the increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing, although the pace of increase is likely to decelerate as the materialization of pent-up demand slows and the positive contribution of the government's various measures wanes. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is projected to continue increasing. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase steadily. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat throughout the projection period, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19 and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with an The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) had been increasing led by the rise in import prices. However, the rate of increase has decelerated recently, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures. Since international commodity prices are lower than a while ago and the year-on-year rate of increase in the import price index has decelerated, it is projected that there will be a waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the rise in import prices. For this reason, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is highly likely to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately, albeit with 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as firms' The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges are expected to for the first half of fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are likely to push up the rate due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of change is projected to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2023 and then be in the range of The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to turn positive around the middle of fiscal 2023 and expand moderately toward the end of the projection period, albeit at a gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently after rising moderately. The March 2023 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has been at a high level, and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has also been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. With regard to the annual compiled by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) show that the wage growth rate agreed in the negotiations thus far has been significantly higher than in the previous year, including base pay. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Regarding the outlook, even as actual inflation decelerates toward the middle of fiscal 2023, inflation expectations are likely to rise again moderately toward the end of the projection period, behavior and in labor-management wage negotiations. This will likely lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage increases. Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to raise their policy interest rates. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow, albeit at a moderate pace. That said, vigilance against the risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases has remained high, mainly in advanced economies. In this situation, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. In addition, there was a phase when market participants' risk sentiment deteriorated, mainly due to the effects of issues surrounding some financial institutions in the United States and Europe. With central banks continuing to make policy interest rate hikes, there is also a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further, mainly through adjustments in asset prices, fluctuations in outflows from emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign regarding China, where the resumption of economic activity has progressed rapidly, there are high uncertainties over the pace of materialization of pent-up demand in terms of both The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the area, could heighten. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, there are extremely high uncertainties regarding the outlook, such as over geopolitical factors -- particularly the situation surrounding Ukraine -- and the effects of efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase households' real income, and this could lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. The third factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by competitors. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through to consumer prices could continue longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario as moves to reflect not only price developments in wage setting but also wage developments in price setting become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with prices of commodities, including grains, declining on the whole, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could decline through the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation and this could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although a wage growth rate that is significantly higher than in the previous year is likely to be achieved as a result of this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected from next year and prices will deviate The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been above 2 percent. The rate of increase, however, is expected to decelerate to a level below 2 percent toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Although it will take time, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices as well as developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, including the effects of the recent issues surrounding some financial institutions in the United States and Europe, the financial system is likely to remain highly 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in January 2023 Forecasts made in January 2023 Forecasts made in January 2023 Notes: 1.

Although exports are projected to show some weakness for the time being, they are expected to be on a moderate increasing trend, with overseas economies growing moderately on the whole. Domestic demand also is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and active government spending, although it has declined recently, due mainly to the effects of the consumption tax hike and natural disasters. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising throughout the projection period, despite such effects as of the past decline in crude oil prices for the time being. \uf06c Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected growth rates are higher, mainly for fiscal 2020, reflecting the effects of the government's economic measures. The projected rates of increase in the CPI are more or less unchanged. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside, particularly regarding developments in overseas economies. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the downside risks to economic activity and uncertainties over developments in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. The momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is maintained but is not yet sufficiently firm, and thus developments in prices continue to warrant careful attention. 1 The text of \"The Bank's View\" -- the outlook for economic activity and prices as well as the Bank's thinking on the conduct of monetary policy, both of which are based on individual Policy Board members' views -- was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 20 and 21, 2020. Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from have shown some weakness, mainly affected by the slowdown in overseas economies and natural disasters. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have continued to be observed. In this situation, exports have continued to show some weakness, and industrial production has declined recently, due partly to the effects of natural disasters. On the other hand, with corporate profits staying at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations due to improvement in the employment and income situation. Housing investment has been more or less flat, and public investment has increased moderately. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have remained tight. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. and the same hereafter) is at around 0.5 percent. Inflation expectations have been more With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend throughout the projection period -- that is, through fiscal 2021 -- as the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited, although the effects of the slowdown are likely to remain for the time being. In a situation where the growth pace of overseas economies will take some time to pick up, exports are projected to show some weakness for the time being. However, overseas economies are expected to grow moderately on the whole, with the growth rates rising on goods shifting toward a phase of improvement. Under these circumstances, Japan's exports are projected to return to their moderate increasing trend. Although domestic demand has declined recently, due mainly to the effects of the consumption tax hike and natural disasters, it is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household active government spending. Business fixed investment -- mainly investment related to research and development (R&D) investment for growth areas -- is likely to continue increasing moderately amid accommodative financial conditions, although the pace of increase is expected to decelerate temporarily, mainly for manufacturing, due to the capital stock are projected to exert downward pressure from a somewhat longer-term perspective. Private consumption is expected to follow a moderate increasing trend with such effects as of the consumption tax hike waning gradually and the employment and income situation continuing to improve. Meanwhile, government spending is expected to reflect the government's economic measures, in addition to Olympic Games-related demand; government spending thereafter is likely to remain at a relatively high level. Thus, the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited. On this basis, although Japan's economy has grown at a slower pace than its potential recently, it is expected to see an acceleration in its growth pace thereafter.2 Thus, on average, the economy is likely to continue growing at about the same pace as its potential or at a somewhat faster pace. Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected growth rates are higher, mainly for fiscal 2020, reflecting the effects of the Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, short- and long-term real interest rates are assumed to be in negative territory throughout the projection period as the Bank pursues \"Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control.\"3 Financial institutions' active lending attitudes, as well as favorable conditions for corporate bond and CP issuance, are likely to be maintained conditions are likely to remain highly accommodative. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to follow a moderate uptrend throughout the projection period against the backdrop of the following continuing developments: progress in implementation of the government's growth strategy, including regulatory and institutional reforms as well as measures to strengthen productivity, which are part of the strategy; and firms' fixed investment and efforts toward improving productivity. In addition, 2 Under a specific methodology, Japan's potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent recently. However, the estimate of the potential growth rate varies depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. Thus, it should be regarded as being subject to a considerable margin of error. 3 Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding future policy. Japan's economy, monetary easing effects are likely to be enhanced. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been positive but has continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and tight labor This is basically because firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance, as well as households' cautiousness toward price rises, have not yet clearly changed in a situation where the mindset and behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched. Firms' efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs by raising productivity, the technological progress in recent years, and the high wage elasticity of labor supply also are contributing factors. In addition, the continued lackluster developments in administered prices and housing rent are likely to have affected the sluggishness in prices. It has been taking time to resolve these factors that have been delaying price rises, and the situation likely has continued in which the responsiveness of prices to the output gap, as well as inflation expectations that are strongly affected by the adaptive formation mechanism, do not rise easily. With regard to the outlook, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising throughout the projection period, despite such effects as of the past decline in crude oil prices for the time being. Comparing the current projections with the previous ones, the projected rates of increase in the CPI are more or less unchanged.4 gradually toward 2 percent can be explained by the following factors that determine general price inflation. First, although the output gap -- which shows the utilization of labor and capital -- recently seems to have narrowed within positive territory due to such effects as of the slowdown in overseas economies and the consumption tax hike, it is likely to growth rate is expected to exceed its potential somewhat. Under such circumstances, further price rises are likely to be observed widely as households' tolerance of price rises 4 Taking into account the actual CPI figures for October and November 2019, the effect of the October 2019 consumption tax hike on the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for October 2019 onward is estimated to be 1.0 percentage point; the effects for fiscal 2019 and 2020 are estimated to be 0.5 percentage point for each fiscal year. In addition, based on a specific assumption, the effects of policies concerning the provision of free education on the year-on-year rates of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2019 and 2020 are estimated to be around minus 0.3 percentage point and around minus 0.4 percentage point, respectively. increases, mainly reflecting a rise in wage growth rates, and as firms' stance shifts toward further raising prices. Second, medium- to long-term inflation expectations have remained more or less unchanged. As for the outlook, such expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend and gradually converge to 2 percent on the back of the following: (1) in terms of the adaptive component, a rise in the observed inflation rate is likely to push up inflation expectations, and (2) in terms of the forward-looking component, the Bank will pursue monetary easing through its strong commitment to achieving the price stability target, which will be effective in pushing up inflation expectations.5 Third, regarding import prices, the past decline in crude oil prices is likely to push down the CPI through the fall in energy prices for the time being. However, such downward pressure is projected to diminish gradually. strengthening of efforts toward improving productivity, are expected to increase upward pressure on prices in the long term. Specifically, as the growth potential of the economy as a whole rises, reflecting such moves, firms' and households' spending behavior can be expected to become active. The following four factors are upside and downside risks to the Bank's baseline scenario regarding the economy. The first is developments in overseas economies. Specifically, the following are considered as risks: the consequences of protectionist moves and their effects; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies such as China; concerning overseas economies seem to be still significant, although they have decreased somewhat compared to a while ago, and it also is necessary to pay close 5 Medium- to long-term inflation expectations can be regarded as consisting of two components: a forward-looking component, in which inflation expectations converge to the price stability target set by the central bank, and a backward-looking, or adaptive, component that reflects the observed inflation rate. For details, see the Bank's Comprehensive Assessment: Developments in Economic Activity and Prices as well as Policy Effects since the Introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) released in September 2016. The second risk is the effects of the consumption tax hike conducted in October 2019. Fluctuations in demand prior to and after the tax hike seem to have been constrained this time compared with those of the previous tax hike in April 2014, partly due to various measures implemented by the government. Although the impact of a decline in real income is expected to be smaller than that of the previous tax hike, it continues to warrant attention as it is likely to depend on consumer sentiment, the employment and income Third, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations may be either raised or lowered depending on the following: efforts to address medium- to long-term issues such as the declining birthrate and aging population; developments in regulatory declines, the economy may deviate downward from the baseline scenario through increasing concerns regarding the future and the rises in long-term interest rates associated with them. On the other hand, there also is a possibility that the economy will deviate upward from the baseline scenario if confidence in the path toward fiscal consolidation strengthens and concerns regarding the future are alleviated. As mentioned above, with regard to risks to economic activity, the downside risks concerning overseas economies in particular seem to be still significant. If these risks materialize, close attention should be paid to the possibility that prices also will be affected In addition, the specific factors that could exert upside and downside risks to prices are as follows. The first is developments in firms' and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Although inflation expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend, there is a risk that a rise in such expectations will be delayed through the adaptive formation mechanism if it takes longer than projected for firms' stance to shift toward further raising wages and prices and actual inflation consequently remains relatively sluggish. The second factor is the responsiveness of prices to the output gap. If firms' efforts to absorb upward pressure of costs by raising productivity continue for a long time, or stemming from these factors may last longer than expected. In addition, the lackluster developments in administered prices and housing rent also may continue to constrain the Third, developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices going forward, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices, may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent. Although it is necessary to carefully examine the risks to economic activity and prices, the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent appears to be maintained. This is because (1) firms' stance is expected to gradually shift toward further raising wages and prices with the output gap remaining positive, and (2) medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged and are projected to rise gradually as further price rises come to be observed widely. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. With regard to the outlook for economic activity, risks are skewed to the downside, particularly regarding developments in overseas economies. Regarding the outlook for prices, risks are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the long-term inflation expectations. Although there has been no further increase in the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost, it is necessary to continue to pay close attention to the possibility. Examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, there is no sign so far of excessively bullish prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, with the low interest rate environment and severe competition among financial institutions continuing, could create risks of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation and of destabilizing the financial system. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary 6 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for the policy rates, the Bank expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. It will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. In particular, in a situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies, are significant, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.

This was underpinned fixed consumption, although external demand made a negative contribution, reflecting the effects of the slowdown in overseas economies. In this situation, the number of employed persons has followed an uptrend and labor market conditions, as seen in openings-to-applicants ratio, have remained tight (Charts 2 and 3). The output gap -- which captures the utilization of labor and capital -- for the July-September quarter has remained October suggest that exports, production, and business sentiment have shown some weakness, affected by the slowdown in overseas economies, Domestic demand has maintained an uptrend, mainly in terms of business fixed investment and the tax hike and natural disasters recently have been observed, mainly 7 \"The Background\" provides explanations of \"The Bank's View\" decided by the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 20 and 21, 2020. 15-10-5051015111213141516171819 Active job openings-to-applicants ratio(right scale)Sources: Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; Ministryof Health, Labour and Welfare.Chart 2:LaborMarket Conditionss.a.,%CYs.a., ratio consumption. Thus, Japan's economy is judged as having been on a moderate expanding trend being maintained.

Thus, the economy is likely to continue growing at about the same pace as its fluctuations are smoothed out 9 The consumption tax hike conducted in October 2019 will have some impact on the GDP growth rates, mainly due to changes in household spending, through the following two channels: (1) fluctuations in demand prior to and after the tax hike and (2) a decline in real income. At present, the negative impact of the tax hike on the growth rates for fiscal 2019 and 2020 is expected to be smaller than that of the previous tax hike in fiscal 2014. This is mainly due to the following: (1) as the tax hike was conducted in the middle of fiscal 2019, there are the technical factors of fluctuations in demand prior to and after the hike offsetting each other during that fiscal year -- although they will push down the growth rate for fiscal 2020 -- and of the effects of the decline in real income being dispersed over fiscal 2019 and 2020; (2) the increase in the consumption tax rate was smaller than that of the previous tax hike and the reduced tax rate was applied to some items; (3) free education was introduced, and various measures to reduce the household burden of the tax hike and to smooth out demand were implemented; and (4) before the previous tax hike in April 2014, it was likely that a front-loaded increase in demand was seen not only in view of that hike but also in anticipation of the second round of the tax hike, which was supposed to take place in October 2015. Although fluctuations in demand prior to and after the tax hike this time seem to be constrained compared to those of the previous tax hike on the whole, considerable uncertainties remain depending on developments in consumer sentiment, as the effects of the decline in real income tend to appear gradually over time. 2-101234585909500051015 Potential growth rateChart 5:Potential Growth Ratey/y % chg.FYSource: Bank of Japan.Note: Based on staff estimations. previous ones, the projected growth rates are higher, mainly for fiscal 2020, reflecting the effects The potential growth rate is expected to follow a period against the backdrop of the following continuing strategy, including regulatory and institutional reforms as well as measures to strengthen productivity, which are part of the economic business fixed investment aimed at saving labor efforts toward improving productivity. Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. Through the end of fiscal 2019, the economic growth rate is expected to pick up from disasters dissipating, although the effects of the slowdown in overseas economies are likely to goods and capital goods, are projected to show some weakness. Private consumption is likely to pick up from a decline at the end of last year as in demand prior to the tax hike are expected to dissipate, underpinned by various measures implemented accompanying the tax hike. On the other hand, business fixed investment is expected to maintain an uptrend, supported by steadiness and R&D investments, although it is projected to is to continue increasing moderately, mainly in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following In fiscal 2020, the economy is likely to grow at a pace that exceeds its potential somewhat, as the economic measures are expected to stimulate overseas economies picking up and the effects of the tax hike waning. Government spending is likely to increase steadily as expenditure on temporary facilities accompanying the hosting of the Olympic Games is expected to be made in the first half of the fiscal year and construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, which is part of the economic measures, is projected to make progress. Exports are expected to return to a moderate uptrend, amid IT-related goods. Business fixed investment is likely to continue on a moderate uptrend, since is expected to gradually pick up with construction investments remaining steady, despite being under adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock.

Thus, the reactionary decline since the second half of last year has been large.

In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. Through fiscal 2025, it is also expected that a dissipation of the effects of the government's measures pushing down inflation will make a positive contribution to the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food), whereas factors such as the recent decline in crude oil and other resource prices will make a negative contribution. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rates are more or less unchanged.

Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. In particular, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2025. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 30 and 31, 2024. Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. Overseas economies have grown moderately on the whole. Exports and industrial production have been more or less flat. Corporate profits have improved and business sentiment has stayed at a favorable level. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has been on a moderate increasing trend despite the impact of price rises and other factors. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been less fresh food) has been at around 2.5 percent recently, as services prices have continued to rise moderately, reflecting factors such as wage increases, although the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have waned. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies continuing to grow moderately and as a virtuous cycle from income The projected real GDP growth rates are more or less unchanged from those presented in In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased situation, nominal wages are expected to keep increasing clearly, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Against this backdrop, for the time being, although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately, mainly reflecting the rise in wage growth. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned, for the time being, by the government's initiatives such as the continuation of measures to reduce the household 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and, with regard to the future conduct of policy, referring to views incorporated in financial markets that the policy interest rate will rise moderately. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend, mainly due to a recovery in global demand for IT-related goods, as overseas economies continue to grow moderately. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend with a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat. Government consumption is expected to increase moderately in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. Through fiscal 2025, it is also expected that a dissipation of the effects of the government's measures pushing down inflation will make a positive contribution to the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI other resource prices will make a negative contribution. Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2025 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are high uncertainties over how factors such as advances in digitalization will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. is somewhat lower due to factors such as the recent decline in crude oil and other The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges had pushed down 2023. For fiscal 2024 and 2025, the phasing out of these measures is projected to push up the rates. Looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to be at around 2 percent, as services and other prices are expected to continue rising moderately, reflecting factors such as wage increases, although the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are projected to wane gradually. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend, albeit with fluctuations. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to widen moderately within positive territory toward the end of the projection period. Meanwhile, labor market conditions are expected to tighten to a greater extent than can be explained by the changes in the output gap, partly due to a deceleration in the on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. Firms' inflation outlook has increased moderately. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and nominal wages have increased clearly. In addition, moves to reflect wage increases in selling prices have continued to strengthen. Regarding the outlook, inflation expectations are expected to rise moderately, with behavior. Under these circumstances, the virtuous cycle between wages and prices is projected to keep intensifying through achievement of wage increases that reflect price rises and through a pass-through of wage increases to selling prices. Considering the above assessments, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, mainly reflecting the improvement in the output gap and the rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations; in the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. That said, there remain uncertainties regarding this outlook, and it is necessary to carefully monitor factors such Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Inflation rates in the United States and Europe have followed a declining trend, albeit with fluctuations, and central banks in these economies have started to lower policy interest rates. In this situation, the U.S. and European economies are likely to avoid significant slowdowns. That said, there are uncertainties over how past policy interest rate hikes by overseas central banks will affect their real economies and financial systems. There is also a risk of fluctuations widening in financial and foreign exchange markets depending on the pace of economic slowdown and due to expectations regarding central banks' policy conduct. It is necessary to take these risks Meanwhile, depending on factors such as the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine and the Middle East, downward pressure on overseas economies could heighten. In addition, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of growth, as adjustment pressure has continued in the real estate and labor markets, and it is necessary to pay attention to how inventory adjustment pressure on some goods will affect overseas economic activity and prices. The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, including grains. Attention continues to be warranted on the risk that prices of grains and other commodities will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. If the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. Moreover, with progress in the pass-through of the rise in import strengthen further, and this could push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is the impact of various changes in the environment surrounding Japan on firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations and on Japan's potential growth rate. It is expected that factors such as the experience of COVID-19, intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization and on labor market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Intensifying labor shortages -- which are partly due to demographic changes -- could accelerate labor-saving investment, such as for digitalization. On the other hand, if such a substitution of labor with capital does not sufficiently progress, there is a risk that supply-side constraints in some industries will push down the growth rate. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. While firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, there remain uncertainties over the extent to which moves to reflect wage developments in selling prices will become widespread. It is expected in the baseline scenario that the virtuous cycle between wages and prices will continue to intensify. However, given that firms, especially small and medium-sized firms, have continued to report that it has been difficult to pass on their employees' higher wages to their selling prices, the rise in selling prices could be limited. Since the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in Japanese society for a prolonged period, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether moves to pass on increases in wages and other costs to selling prices will weaken with the waning of the effects of the pass-through of import prices to consumer prices. On the other hand, moves to reflect wages in selling prices could strengthen to a greater extent than expected, and upward pressure on wages could intensify with growing expectations that labor market conditions will continue to be tight. In this situation, there is also a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario, accompanied by a rise in medium- to long-term inflation The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. In addition, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with the virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There remain high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are generally balanced. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2025. Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has generally not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities, although attention continues to be warranted on the pace of increase in stock and real estate prices. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. In addition, even in the case of an financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. Moreover, financial institutions' resilience to rises in yen interest rates has headed toward improvement, mainly reflecting 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" their portfolio rebalancing in securities investment. When examining financial imbalances such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, while it will depend on developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions going forward, given that real interest rates are at significantly low levels, if the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized, the Bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. On this basis, the Bank needs to pay and developments in financial and capital markets. It also needs to examine how these factors will affect the outlook for Japan's economic activity and prices, the risks surrounding them, and the likelihood of realizing the outlook. With the price stability target of 2 percent, the Bank will conduct monetary policy as appropriate, in response to Forecasts made in July 2024 Forecasts made in July 2024 Forecasts made in July 2024 Notes: 1.

Business fixed investment is expected to continue on an increasing household sector, nominal employee income is likely to continue to see a clear increase, mainly reflecting a rise in employment on the back of an 7 However, the output gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some latitude. For example, in terms of labor, it is highly uncertain what kind of working style will take hold going forward -- including among women and seniors -- given the experience of COVID-19, that of wage and price increases, and with demographic changes. In addition, in the corporate sector, it is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization will change Japan's economic and industrial structures; however, there remain high uncertainties over the extent of advancement and sustainability of innovation and sectoral reallocation of production factors, both of which aim at adapting to changes in the economic and industrial structures. government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher energy prices are projected to push up disposable income. In this situation, private consumption is expected to remain on a moderate increasing trend, despite being affected In fiscal 2025 and 2026, Japan's economy is expected to grow at a pace above its potential rising. Goods exports are likely to increase moderately, with overseas economies continuing to grow. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is also expected to continue increasing, mainly for digital-related investment, investment related to investment associated with strengthening supply employee income is likely to continue to see a clear increase. This is because wage growth is expected to remain relatively high as the linkage between wages and prices strengthens further, although it will gradually become more difficult for participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far.

Looking at the energy-related economic measures in more detail, with regard to gasoline subsidies, the government has continued to provide subsidies to petroleum distributors and importers as funds to contain a sharp rise in their selling prices when the nationwide average for retail gasoline prices exceeds the benchmark price (168 yen per liter). As for electricity charges, the government discontinued the discounts at the end of June 2024, and the year-on-year rate of change in these charges increased in July and August; however, the government then cut the charges by 4 yen per kilowatt-hour for September and October and will reduce the charges by 2.5 yen per kilowatt-hour for November (the months refer to the timing at which the charges are calculated). These cuts will likely make a negative contribution to the year-on-year rate of change in electricity charges.

Looking at the (Chart B3-3[1]) shows that, whereas the increase in inflation shortly after the pandemic can be explained mainly by the rise in import prices, such pressure on prices cannot be fully explained by supply and demand conditions. A closer look at behavior is pushing up prices, as positive wage shocks are pushing up the CPI (Chart B3-3[2]). It is likely that wage shocks will serve as a more average relationship observed during the low inflation period and will push up prices. 26 Bernanke and Blanchard (2024) construct a simple model of prices and wages for the United States to examine the direct and indirect effects of product-market and labor-market shocks on prices and nominal wage increases.

Thereafter, although the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices is projected to wane, the rate of increase in the CPI is expected to stay at around 1 percent toward the end of the projection period, due to the underlying inflationary pressure stemming mainly from improvement in the output gap and a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected growth rate for fiscal 2021 is lower due to the effects of supply-side constraints, but that for fiscal 2022 is higher, mainly on the back of the effects of the government's economic measures and a recovery in production to catch up with demand. The projected rate of increase in the CPI for fiscal 2022 is somewhat higher, mainly reflecting a rise in commodity prices and the pass-through of that rise to consumer prices. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19, including variants, and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention.

Risks to prices are generally balanced. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 17 and 18, 2022. A pick-up in Japan's economy has become evident as the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad has waned gradually. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase as a trend, despite the remaining effects of supply-side constraints. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have continued to improve on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained relatively weak on the whole, although improvement has been seen in some parts. A pick-up in private consumption has become evident, with downward pressure stemming from COVID-19, particularly on services consumption, waning. Housing investment has picked up. Public investment has been relatively weak, albeit at a high level. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the despite being affected by the reduction in mobile phone charges, has been slightly positive, reflecting price rises of energy and other items. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to recover as downward pressure stemming from COVID-19 on services consumption and the effects of supply-side constraints wane, while being supported by the increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. In the corporate sector, exports and production are expected to increase firmly, supported by steady external demand, as the effects of supply-side constraints wane. In this situation, a virtuous cycle is projected to continue operating, in which improvement in corporate profits leads to a rise in business fixed supply-side constraints on automobiles waning, private consumption is likely to recover, Thereafter, the virtuous cycle from income to spending is expected to intensify in the overall economy, including the household sector, supported by accommodative financial conditions, for example. In this situation, Japan's economy is projected to see an measures and of the recovery in production to catch up with demand. Toward the end of the projection period, the economy is likely to continue growing, albeit slower, at a pace Looking at the outlook for economic activity in more detail, as the impact of COVID-19 wanes gradually, overseas economies are likely to continue growing, albeit with variation across countries and regions, supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies taken mainly in advanced economies. In this situation, Japan's exports of goods, mainly automobile-related ones, are expected to increase clearly for the time being as supply-side constraints on parts wane. Thereafter, they are projected to continue increasing on the back of firm expansion in global demand, including for digital-related goods. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry and travel restrictions continue but is likely to Corporate profits are projected to continue on an improving trend on the back of a recovery in domestic and external demand, despite being affected by deterioration in the terms of trade that reflects the rise in commodity prices and by supply-side constraints. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear -- development (R&D) investment related to decarbonization -- supported by improvement measures, although weakness is projected to remain for the time being in investment by Private consumption, despite being restrained for the time being, mainly through vigilance against COVID-19, is expected to recover, supported by the materialization of pent-up resumption of consumption activities progresses while public health is being protected, mainly due to the widespread vaccinations. Thereafter, private consumption is projected to continue increasing at a slower but moderate pace, supported by improvement in employee income. Employee income is likely to increase moderately on the back of a rise in the number of employees that reflects the recovery in domestic and external demand Public investment is projected to be at a relatively high level, reflecting progress such as in construction related to building national resilience. Government consumption is likely to increase, mainly reflecting a pick-up in healthcare expenditure and enhancement of the COVID-19 vaccination and medical treatment systems, but see a lowering in its level thereafter due to a reduction in expenditure related to COVID-19. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately, mainly on the back of capital stock growth due to the rise in business fixed investment.2 These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's measures to transform the economic The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase in positive territory for the time being. That is, albeit with fluctuations due to temporary factors such as the \"Go To Travel\" campaign, the increase in the CPI is expected to be brought about by the rise in Thereafter, while the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane, the underlying inflationary pressure is projected to increase, mainly on the back of The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI therefore is expected to stay at around 1 The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been negative recently. However, it is projected to turn positive around the first half of fiscal 2022 with the economy returning to a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, and then continue to expand moderately. Under these circumstances, as households' tolerance of price rises improves moderately, mainly reflecting an increase in wage inflation, and as firms' price-setting stance gradually becomes active, the pass-through of cost increases and a rise in selling prices are likely to become widely observed. In addition, the increase in actual inflation is expected to lead to a rise in households' and firms' medium- to encourage further price rises. Curve Control. Since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, it also has supported to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). The government has also conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms. Private financial institutions have actively fulfilled the functioning of financial intermediation. In this situation, firms' financial 2 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be marginally positive. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. positions have continued to improve on the whole due to a pick-up in economic activity, although weakness has remained in financial positions of firms in industries that are As the Bank pursues QQE with Yield Curve Control, it is expected that financial conditions will remain accommodative and that this will support an increase in private demand.3 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In addition, backed by the Bank's measures to support financing, the government's measures, and efforts made by private financial institutions, firms' financial positions -- including those of small and medium-sized ones, for which weakness has remained to date -- are likely to continue on an improving trend along with an economic recovery. Regarding the upside and downside risks to the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay attention to the following factors. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on private consumption as well as on firms' export and to the spread of highly contagious variants, there is a risk that private consumption will be pushed down. In addition, in a case where COVID-19 cases surge in areas such as Asia, which is closely related to Japan's economy, with global supply-demand conditions of digital-related goods such as semiconductors remaining tight, export and production activities of Japanese firms could also be pushed down through supply-chain disruptions. On the other hand, if people's vigilance against COVID-19 lessens significantly with the widespread vaccinations and the rollout of antiviral medicines, economic activity could be pushed up through, for example, a larger-than-expected increase in pent-up demand for The second factor is developments in overseas economies. If supply-side constraints that mainly stem from the stagnation of logistics and labor shortage become prolonged or amplified in advanced economies such as the United States, there is a risk that the growth rates of overseas economies will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. In addition, signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy could become clearer due, for long-term growth potential declining gradually. Furthermore, there is a risk that overseas economies, particularly emerging economies, will deviate downward from the baseline 3 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. scenario if global financial conditions tighten by more than expected amid concern in global financial markets over steps taken by advanced economies toward reducing monetary accommodation on the back of elevated inflation rates. On the other hand, overseas economies, mainly for consumption activities, could be pushed up through, for example, rapid spending of household savings that have accumulated significantly in the The third factor is developments in commodity prices. Due to a global surge in demand brought about by progress with the resumption of economic activity, commodity prices have been hovering at a high level for a prolonged period, with supply factors, including a decline in capital investment related to fossil fuels against the background of efforts toward decarbonization, also being taken into consideration. As described earlier, corporate profits in Japan basically are projected to continue on an improving trend on the back of the recovery in domestic and external demand, despite being affected by deterioration in the terms of trade that reflects the rise in commodity prices. That said, if the rise in commodity prices becomes prolonged or is not smoothly passed on to selling prices, Japan's economic recovery trend could be negatively affected, mainly through deterioration in corporate profits. The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that efforts with a view to the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization, and decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Depending on how households and firms growth rate, and the output gap could go either upward or downward. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is high uncertainties over firms' price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, as described earlier, it is projected that firms' price-setting stance will gradually become active and the pass-through of raw material cost increases will progress moderately, with continuing improvement in the output gap. That said, depending on the degree of upward pass-through of cost increases to selling prices could accelerate by more than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, given that, in Japan, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices will not increase easily are deeply entrenched mainly among firms, there is a risk that the pass-through of cost increases to selling prices, particularly to downstream or consumer prices, which are closer to final demand, will not progress, and that prices will deviate The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Thus, it is necessary to continue paying attention to In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. Although it will take time, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19, including variants, and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In addition, there are high uncertainties over future developments in overseas economies given the effects of supply-side constraints, as well as in commodity prices and their impact on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are generally balanced. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole, despite the pandemic. In addition, even in the case of a future resurgence of COVID-19, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

In this situation, corporate profits are expected to continue following their improving trend, and business fixed investment is likely to increase, including for digital-related investment, for growth areas and to address environmental issues. As employee income picks up, private consumption is expected to increase clearly, supported by demand. Meanwhile, government spending is likely to increase on the whole. This is based on the projection that construction related to building national resilience will progress, expenditure related to COVID-19 included in the government's economic measures will continue, and healthcare and nursing care expenditures will see an growth is likely to decelerate, mainly due to the waning, Japan's economy is expected to continue growing steadily, supported by sustained growth financial conditions.

This box therefore refers to the difference between these two indices as the effects of special sales. Technically, however, while the T-index covers all prices for special sales, the CPI compiled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications excludes prices for special sales which last for seven days or less.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023, with a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately, albeit with fluctuations, as the output gap improves and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as firms' price- and wage-setting behavior. \uf06c Comparing the projections through fiscal 2024 with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rates for fiscal 2022 and 2023 are lower, mainly due to a lower projection for private consumption, but the projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is more or less unchanged. The projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 and 2024 are somewhat higher, mainly due to a higher projection for wages. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices as well as developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on April 27 and 28, 2023. Japan's economy has picked up, despite being affected by factors such as past high commodity prices. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has been more or less unchanged. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole. Private consumption has increased moderately, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some fresh food) is slower than a while ago, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures, but it has been at around 3 percent recently owing to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently after rising. Toward around the middle of fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is likely to recover moderately, supported by the materialization of pent-up demand, as well as by factors such as it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from past high commodity prices In the household sector, regarding the employment situation, the number of both regular and non-regular employees is likely to rise on the back of improvement in economic activity. In addition, wage growth is expected to increase, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be affected by price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately. This is mainly because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions. Private consumption is also likely to be underpinned by the government's measures such as those to reduce the In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies resulting mainly from the impact they are likely to be more or less flat due to factors such as a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Although past high raw material costs are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at continued improvement in economic activity. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support and the effects of supply-side constraints wane, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor investment associated with strengthening supply chains. From the second half of fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at gradually intensifies in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period due to a waning of the In the household sector, employment is projected to continue increasing, but the pace of increase is likely to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an recovery. In this situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Supported by the increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing, although the pace of increase is likely to decelerate as the materialization of pent-up demand slows and the positive contribution of the government's various measures wanes. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is projected to continue increasing. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase steadily. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat throughout the projection period, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19 and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with an The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) had been increasing led by the rise in import prices. However, the rate of increase has decelerated recently, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures. Since international commodity prices are lower than a while ago and the year-on-year rate of increase in the import price index has decelerated, it is projected that there will be a waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the rise in import prices. For this reason, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is highly likely to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately, albeit with 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as firms' The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges are expected to for the first half of fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are likely to push up the rate due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of change is projected to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2023 and then be in the range of The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to turn positive around the middle of fiscal 2023 and expand moderately toward the end of the projection period, albeit at a gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently after rising moderately. The March 2023 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has been at a high level, and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has also been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. With regard to the annual compiled by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) show that the wage growth rate agreed in the negotiations thus far has been significantly higher than in the previous year, including base pay. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Regarding the outlook, even as actual inflation decelerates toward the middle of fiscal 2023, inflation expectations are likely to rise again moderately toward the end of the projection period, behavior and in labor-management wage negotiations. This will likely lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage increases. Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to raise their policy interest rates. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow, albeit at a moderate pace. That said, vigilance against the risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases has remained high, mainly in advanced economies. In this situation, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. In addition, there was a phase when market participants' risk sentiment deteriorated, mainly due to the effects of issues surrounding some financial institutions in the United States and Europe. With central banks continuing to make policy interest rate hikes, there is also a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further, mainly through adjustments in asset prices, fluctuations in outflows from emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign regarding China, where the resumption of economic activity has progressed rapidly, there are high uncertainties over the pace of materialization of pent-up demand in terms of both The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the area, could heighten. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, there are extremely high uncertainties regarding the outlook, such as over geopolitical factors -- particularly the situation surrounding Ukraine -- and the effects of efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase households' real income, and this could lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. The third factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by competitors. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through to consumer prices could continue longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario as moves to reflect not only price developments in wage setting but also wage developments in price setting become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with prices of commodities, including grains, declining on the whole, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could decline through the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation and this could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although a wage growth rate that is significantly higher than in the previous year is likely to be achieved as a result of this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected from next year and prices will deviate The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been above 2 percent. The rate of increase, however, is expected to decelerate to a level below 2 percent toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Although it will take time, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices as well as developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, including the effects of the recent issues surrounding some financial institutions in the United States and Europe, the financial system is likely to remain highly 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in January 2023 Forecasts made in January 2023 Forecasts made in January 2023 Notes: 1.

The outlook is based on the assumption that the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually and then almost subside in the middle of the projection period. It also is based on the premises that, while the impact remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system the assumption and premises entail high stability being maintained. However, uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on April 26 and 27, 2021. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have improved on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. A pick-up in private consumption has paused due to increased downward pressure on consumption of has declined moderately. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food, and the same hereafter) has been slightly negative, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the past decline in crude oil prices. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. Japan's economy is likely to recover, although the level of economic activity, mainly in the face-to-face services sector, is expected to be lower than that prior to the pandemic for the time being. That is, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually and the economy being supported by an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures, a virtuous cycle from income to spending is expected to operate. Thereafter, as the impact subsides, the economy is projected to continue growing with the virtuous cycle intensifying. This baseline scenario is based on the assumption that, while taking preventive measures against COVID-19 and improving economic activity simultaneously, the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually and then almost subside in the middle of the projection period, due mainly to progress with vaccinations. The outlook also is based on the medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Looking at the outlook for economic activity based on the assumption and premises in more detail, overseas economies are likely to continue growing, albeit with variation across countries and regions, partly supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies is to decelerate time being, mainly automobile-related goods, goods exports are projected to continue increasing firmly, supported by a global recovery in business fixed investment and an expansion in digital-related demand. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry and travel restrictions continue but likely to recover thereafter. An uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear, mainly for supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures, although construction investment by the face-to-face services sector is projected to remain weak. Private consumption, mainly of face-to-face services, is likely to remain sluggish, being at a relatively low level for the time being due to the impact of COVID-19, but then it is expected to pick up again with the impact waning gradually and supported also by the government's economic measures. Thereafter, as the impact of COVID-19 subsides, an uptrend in private consumption, including that of face-to-face services, is projected to become evident with employee income improving. Employee income is likely to stop declining, reflecting improvement in corporate profits, and then increase moderately with a time lag following the recovery in domestic and external demand. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is likely to increase clearly for fiscal 2021, mainly reflecting but see a lowering in its level thereafter. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be slightly negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the reduction in mobile phone charges.2 That said, the reduction is a temporary factor, and when its effects are excluded, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to be steady. Although weakness in demand amid the situation of COVID-19 is projected to have an impact on prices, firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been and are not likely to be observed 2 The CPI forecasts in this Outlook Report are based on the current 2015-base index. The statistics authority that compiles the CPI has announced its plan to rebase the CPI to the base year of 2020 and retroactively revise its figures for the year-on-year rate of change from those for January 2021 onward, both in August 2021. With the rebasing, the reduction in mobile phone charges will have a larger impact than the current index, mainly because the weight of such charges in the CPI will rise. Therefore, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is highly likely to be revised downward for the 2020-base index. widely, given that one of the reasons for the decrease in demand is vigilance against COVID-19 and that there have been supply-side constraints and cost increases because of taking preventive measures against COVID-19. In addition, it is expected that the year-on-year rate of change in energy prices will turn positive on the back of a pick-up in crude oil prices since last autumn. Under these circumstances, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to be more or less unchanged. Thereafter, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually, mainly on the back of economic activity continuing to improve and the effects of the reduction in mobile phone charges dissipating. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are expected to rise again. Curve Control. It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March 2020 in response to the impact of COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets.3 The government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms. Private financial institutions have actively fulfilled the functioning of financial intermediation. In this situation, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen, the environment for has remained accommodative. Owing to the continuation of powerful monetary easing by the Bank, the government's measures, and efforts made by private financial institutions, the Bank considers that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay 3 See \"Enhancement of Monetary Easing in Light of the Impact of the Outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)\" released on March 16, 2020, \"Enhancement of Monetary Easing\" released on April 27, 2020, \"Introduction of a New Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Financing Mainly of Small and Medium-Sized Firms\" released on May 22, 2020, \"Statement on Monetary Policy\" released on December 18, 2020, in which the Bank made decisions such as on the extension of the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), and \"Further Effective and Sustainable Monetary Easing\" released on March 19, 2021. 4 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are high overseas economies. As the baseline scenario, it is assumed that the impact of COVID-19 will subside, mainly due to the vaccine rollout. However, the pace of such rollout and the effects of the vaccines entail uncertainties, and thus there is a risk that downward pressure on economic activity will increase. In addition, it is also uncertain how the varying paces of the vaccine rollout across countries and regions will affect global economic activity. On the other hand, with economic measures conducted particularly in recovery in domestic and overseas economies could be faster than expected. The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the impact of COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if the issue of COVID-19 leads to, for example, active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection and an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, thereby having positive effects on economic activity such as further innovation. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's measures to transform the economic structure The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although COVID-19 has affected the financial side as well, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation has been ensured.5 However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is uncertainties over firms' price-setting behavior amid the impact of COVID-19. As the baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been and are not likely to be observed widely, as described earlier. That said, including this aspect, firms' price-setting behavior entails uncertainties. The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates, international commodity These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario, and thus continue to warrant attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. For the time being, weakness in demand amid the situation of COVID-19 is expected to have an impact on prices, and medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to be more or less unchanged. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase gradually since upward pressure on them is projected to intensify at a gradual pace with the economy continuing to improve. In addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is highly unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the assumption that the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually and then almost subside in the middle of the projection period. It also is based on the premises that, while the impact remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. Looking at the current situation from the perspective of financial imbalances, the aggregate credit relative to the size of the economy has been increasing at a pace significantly above the past trend. This is because financial institutions have responded to demand for working capital, mainly by firms, which has increased due to the 6 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" impact of COVID-19, and the increase in the aggregate credit therefore does not seem to show overheating of financial activities. On this basis, when examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels. 5.0 to -4.9 [-4.9] 0.4 Forecasts made in January 2021 5.7 to -5.4 [-5.6] 0.7 to -0.5 [-0.5] Forecasts made in January 2021 Forecasts made in January 2021 Notes: 1.

This box examines in detail the fact that a virtuous cycle from income to spending has started to operate in the corporate sector.

By industry, while such profits have shown notable also have recovered in the nonmanufacturing the reasons for the improvement in profits is a recovery in sales that reflects a pick-up in be noted, however, that profits have been improving even at a faster pace than the sales is following two factors. The first factor is a substantial reduction in selling, firms actively making efforts to improve business through canceling or cutting back on face-to-face reduction in SG&A expenses has contributed to size, and has pushed up profits for all industries quarters. This amount of increase is equivalent to As long as vigilance against COVID-19 continues, SG&A expenses are likely to remain restrained for the time being, mainly for social expenses and subsides, SG&A expenses are expected increase again, reflecting a recovery in firms' interaction. That said, it is also highly likely that firms will take this opportunity to continue to business processes, which are the management challenges they have faced even before the outbreak of COVID-19. Thus, it seems that some SG&A expenses will not completely return to the there are business travel will be permanently replaced by sales and other activities will increasingly be conducted online.

This is largely corporate profits outpacing the sales recovery is These have been made from the government measures to support firms, which have been implemented to date as part of the government's measures -- such as subsidies for sustaining that complied with to shorten operating hours -- varies across firms, it is difficult to precisely gauge the amount of these subsidies from firms' financial data. That said, in the FSSC, the effects of these subsidies can be seen mainly reduction in costs. In particular, non-operating profits of small and medium-sized firms have increased clearly, mainly in industries that have been hit substantially by COVID-19, such as services, and it is highly likely that this is particularly the portion derived from the sales recovery and the streamlined expenses -- has contributed to the recent pick-up in business fixed investment, coupled with improvement in export financial conditions, as seen institutions' active lending stance.

The results indicate that, while goods prices are sensitive to such factors as the output gap, services prices do not supply-demand conditions, as seen in the fact regressions of services prices are smaller than those for regressions of goods prices and are COVID-19 has been seen mainly in the services appliances -- have improved in terms of the fact that the overall CPI has remained firm seems to be partly because, in the services industry -- where prices are sticky -- deterioration in the supply-demand conditions has not immediately led to exerting downward pressure on prices, 0.20.00.20.40.60.8 Model 2Model 3Model 4 whereas goods prices -- which are more sensitive to economic activity -- have been underpinned by Taking a more detailed look, there are some goods items of which prices are not sensitive to prices are relatively sensitive to economic activity, such as hotel charges and dining-out. To examine this point, it is useful to estimate the price which is compiled by aggregating the rates of items that have high correlation with the output gap.26 The results of estimating CSI for the CPI although CSI has declined recently compared with a while ago, it has remained slightly positive, which is different from at the time of the GFC, when deterioration in the output gap resulted in a substantial decline in CSI (Chart B4-3).27 This suggests that, supported by increased demand 26 Earlier U.S. studies that compiled price indicators sensitive to business cycles include Mahedy and Shapiro (2017) and Stock and Watson (2020).

While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, the rate of increase is projected to be pushed up through fiscal 2025 by factors such as a dissipation of the effects of the government's measures pushing down CPI inflation. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat lower, mainly due to the impact of the statistical revision to the GDP figures for fiscal 2023.

Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. In particular, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2025. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2024 and 2025. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 30 and 31, 2024. Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. Overseas economies have grown moderately on the whole. Exports and industrial production have been more or less flat. Corporate profits have improved and business sentiment has stayed at a favorable level. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has been resilient despite the impact of price rises and other factors. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been at around 2.5 percent recently, as services prices have continued to rise moderately, reflecting factors such as wage increases, although the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have waned. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies continuing to grow moderately and as a virtuous cycle from income Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat lower, mainly due to the impact of the statistical revision to the GDP figures for fiscal 2023. The projected growth rates for fiscal 2025 onward are more or less unchanged. In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Against this backdrop, for the time being, although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to increase moderately, mainly reflecting the rise in wage growth. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned, for the time being, by the government's 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. initiatives such as the continuation of measures to reduce the household burden of higher In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend, mainly due to a pick-up in global demand for IT-related goods, as overseas economies continue to grow moderately. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend with a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat. Government consumption is expected to increase moderately in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, the rate of increase is projected to be pushed up through fiscal 2025 by factors such as a dissipation of the effects of the government's measures pushing down CPI inflation. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 is lower, mainly due to the effects of the government's measures to reduce the household and gas charges; on the other hand, that for fiscal 2025 is somewhat higher due to a dissipation of the effects of these measures. The projected rate of increase in this CPI for fiscal 2026 is more or less unchanged. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges had pushed down 2023. For fiscal 2024 and 2025, the phasing out of these measures is projected to push up the rates. Looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to decelerate, due to a gradual waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices, and subsequently be at around 2 percent. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend, albeit with fluctuations. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to widen moderately within positive territory toward the end of the projection period. Meanwhile, labor market conditions are expected to tighten to a greater extent than can be explained by the changes in the output gap, partly due to a deceleration in the on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. The June 2024 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that firms' inflation outlook for general prices has increased moderately. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and firm wage increases that were higher than those seen in the previous year were achieved in this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations. In addition, moves to reflect wage increases in selling prices have been strengthening. Regarding the outlook, inflation expectations are expected to rise moderately, with continued improvement in the output gap and changes in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, the virtuous cycle between wages and prices is projected to keep intensifying through achievement of wage increases that reflect price rises and through a pass-through of wage increases to selling prices. Considering the above assessments, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, mainly reflecting the improvement in the output gap and the rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations; in the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. That said, there remain uncertainties regarding this outlook, and it is necessary to carefully monitor factors such Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Inflation rates in the United States and Europe have followed a declining trend, albeit with fluctuations, and some central banks have started to slightly lower their policy interest rates. That said, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis and there is a risk of tight monetary policy being prolonged. Moreover, there are uncertainties over how past policy interest rate hikes by overseas central banks will affect their real economies and financial systems. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. Meanwhile, depending on factors such as the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine and the Middle East, downward pressure on overseas economies could heighten. In addition, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets, and it is necessary to pay attention to how inventory adjustment pressure on some goods will The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, including grains. Attention continues to be warranted on the risk that prices of grains and other commodities will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. Moreover, with progress in the pass-through of the rise in import strengthen further, and this could push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is the impact of various changes in the environment surrounding Japan on firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations and on Japan's potential growth rate. It is expected that factors such as the experience of COVID-19, intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization and on labor market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Intensifying labor shortages -- which are partly due to demographic changes -- could accelerate labor-saving investment, such as for digitalization. On the other hand, if such a substitution of labor with capital does not sufficiently progress, there is a risk that supply-side constraints in some industries will push down the growth rate. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. While firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, there remain uncertainties over the extent to which moves to reflect wage developments in selling prices will become widespread. It is expected in the baseline scenario that the virtuous cycle between wages and prices will continue to intensify. However, given that firms, especially small and medium-sized firms, have continued to report that it has been difficult to pass on their employees' higher wages to their selling prices, the rise in selling prices could be limited. Since the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in Japanese society for a prolonged period, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether moves to pass on increases in wages and other costs to selling prices will weaken with the waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. On the other hand, moves to reflect wages in selling prices could strengthen to a greater extent than expected, and upward pressure on wages could intensify with labor market conditions tightening. In this situation, there is also a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario, accompanied by a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. In addition, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with the virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There remain high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2025. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has generally not been seen in asset prices was seen for a time and valuations of some properties seem to have been relatively high in the real estate market. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" abroad and in global financial markets, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. Moreover, financial institutions' resilience to rises in yen interest rates has headed toward improvement, mainly reflecting their portfolio rebalancing in securities investment. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, while it will depend on developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions going forward, given that real interest rates are at significantly low levels, if the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized, the Bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation.

For example, in terms of labor, it is highly uncertain what kind of working style will take hold going forward -- including among women and seniors -- given the experience of COVID-19, that of wage and price increases, and with demographic changes. In addition, in the corporate sector, it is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization will change Japan's economic and industrial structures; however, there remain high uncertainties over the extent of advancement and sustainability of innovation and sectoral reallocation of production factors, both of which aim at adapting to changes in the economic and industrial structures. demand is projected to keep increasing.

It should be noted that, with dispersions of the observed distributions increasing, the fit of the normal inverse Gaussian distribution has deteriorated recently.

Risks to prices are generally balanced. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 17 and 18, 2022. A pick-up in Japan's economy has become evident as the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad has waned gradually. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase as a trend, despite the remaining effects of supply-side constraints. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have continued to improve on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained relatively weak on the whole, although improvement has been seen in some parts. A pick-up in private consumption has become evident, with downward pressure stemming from COVID-19, particularly on services consumption, waning. Housing investment has picked up. Public investment has been relatively weak, albeit at a high level. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the despite being affected by the reduction in mobile phone charges, has been slightly positive, reflecting price rises of energy and other items. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to recover as downward pressure stemming from COVID-19 on services consumption and the effects of supply-side constraints wane, while being supported by the increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. In the corporate sector, exports and production are expected to increase firmly, supported by steady external demand, as the effects of supply-side constraints wane. In this situation, a virtuous cycle is projected to continue operating, in which improvement in corporate profits leads to a rise in business fixed supply-side constraints on automobiles waning, private consumption is likely to recover, Thereafter, the virtuous cycle from income to spending is expected to intensify in the overall economy, including the household sector, supported by accommodative financial conditions, for example. In this situation, Japan's economy is projected to see an measures and of the recovery in production to catch up with demand. Toward the end of the projection period, the economy is likely to continue growing, albeit slower, at a pace Looking at the outlook for economic activity in more detail, as the impact of COVID-19 wanes gradually, overseas economies are likely to continue growing, albeit with variation across countries and regions, supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies taken mainly in advanced economies. In this situation, Japan's exports of goods, mainly automobile-related ones, are expected to increase clearly for the time being as supply-side constraints on parts wane. Thereafter, they are projected to continue increasing on the back of firm expansion in global demand, including for digital-related goods. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry and travel restrictions continue but is likely to Corporate profits are projected to continue on an improving trend on the back of a recovery in domestic and external demand, despite being affected by deterioration in the terms of trade that reflects the rise in commodity prices and by supply-side constraints. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear -- development (R&D) investment related to decarbonization -- supported by improvement measures, although weakness is projected to remain for the time being in investment by Private consumption, despite being restrained for the time being, mainly through vigilance against COVID-19, is expected to recover, supported by the materialization of pent-up resumption of consumption activities progresses while public health is being protected, mainly due to the widespread vaccinations. Thereafter, private consumption is projected to continue increasing at a slower but moderate pace, supported by improvement in employee income. Employee income is likely to increase moderately on the back of a rise in the number of employees that reflects the recovery in domestic and external demand Public investment is projected to be at a relatively high level, reflecting progress such as in construction related to building national resilience. Government consumption is likely to increase, mainly reflecting a pick-up in healthcare expenditure and enhancement of the COVID-19 vaccination and medical treatment systems, but see a lowering in its level thereafter due to a reduction in expenditure related to COVID-19. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately, mainly on the back of capital stock growth due to the rise in business fixed investment.2 These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's measures to transform the economic The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase in positive territory for the time being. That is, albeit with fluctuations due to temporary factors such as the \"Go To Travel\" campaign, the increase in the CPI is expected to be brought about by the rise in Thereafter, while the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane, the underlying inflationary pressure is projected to increase, mainly on the back of The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI therefore is expected to stay at around 1 The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been negative recently. However, it is projected to turn positive around the first half of fiscal 2022 with the economy returning to a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, and then continue to expand moderately. Under these circumstances, as households' tolerance of price rises improves moderately, mainly reflecting an increase in wage inflation, and as firms' price-setting stance gradually becomes active, the pass-through of cost increases and a rise in selling prices are likely to become widely observed. In addition, the increase in actual inflation is expected to lead to a rise in households' and firms' medium- to encourage further price rises. Curve Control. Since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, it also has supported to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). The government has also conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms. Private financial institutions have actively fulfilled the functioning of financial intermediation. In this situation, firms' financial 2 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be marginally positive. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. positions have continued to improve on the whole due to a pick-up in economic activity, although weakness has remained in financial positions of firms in industries that are As the Bank pursues QQE with Yield Curve Control, it is expected that financial conditions will remain accommodative and that this will support an increase in private demand.3 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In addition, backed by the Bank's measures to support financing, the government's measures, and efforts made by private financial institutions, firms' financial positions -- including those of small and medium-sized ones, for which weakness has remained to date -- are likely to continue on an improving trend along with an economic recovery. Regarding the upside and downside risks to the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay attention to the following factors. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on private consumption as well as on firms' export and to the spread of highly contagious variants, there is a risk that private consumption will be pushed down. In addition, in a case where COVID-19 cases surge in areas such as Asia, which is closely related to Japan's economy, with global supply-demand conditions of digital-related goods such as semiconductors remaining tight, export and production activities of Japanese firms could also be pushed down through supply-chain disruptions. On the other hand, if people's vigilance against COVID-19 lessens significantly with the widespread vaccinations and the rollout of antiviral medicines, economic activity could be pushed up through, for example, a larger-than-expected increase in pent-up demand for The second factor is developments in overseas economies. If supply-side constraints that mainly stem from the stagnation of logistics and labor shortage become prolonged or amplified in advanced economies such as the United States, there is a risk that the growth rates of overseas economies will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. In addition, signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy could become clearer due, for long-term growth potential declining gradually. Furthermore, there is a risk that overseas economies, particularly emerging economies, will deviate downward from the baseline 3 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. scenario if global financial conditions tighten by more than expected amid concern in global financial markets over steps taken by advanced economies toward reducing monetary accommodation on the back of elevated inflation rates. On the other hand, overseas economies, mainly for consumption activities, could be pushed up through, for example, rapid spending of household savings that have accumulated significantly in the The third factor is developments in commodity prices. Due to a global surge in demand brought about by progress with the resumption of economic activity, commodity prices have been hovering at a high level for a prolonged period, with supply factors, including a decline in capital investment related to fossil fuels against the background of efforts toward decarbonization, also being taken into consideration. As described earlier, corporate profits in Japan basically are projected to continue on an improving trend on the back of the recovery in domestic and external demand, despite being affected by deterioration in the terms of trade that reflects the rise in commodity prices. That said, if the rise in commodity prices becomes prolonged or is not smoothly passed on to selling prices, Japan's economic recovery trend could be negatively affected, mainly through deterioration in corporate profits. The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that efforts with a view to the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization, and decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Depending on how households and firms growth rate, and the output gap could go either upward or downward. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is high uncertainties over firms' price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, as described earlier, it is projected that firms' price-setting stance will gradually become active and the pass-through of raw material cost increases will progress moderately, with continuing improvement in the output gap. That said, depending on the degree of upward pass-through of cost increases to selling prices could accelerate by more than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, given that, in Japan, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices will not increase easily are deeply entrenched mainly among firms, there is a risk that the pass-through of cost increases to selling prices, particularly to downstream or consumer prices, which are closer to final demand, will not progress, and that prices will deviate The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Thus, it is necessary to continue paying attention to In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. Although it will take time, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19, including variants, and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In addition, there are high uncertainties over future developments in overseas economies given the effects of supply-side constraints, as well as in commodity prices and their impact on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are generally balanced. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole, despite the pandemic. In addition, even in the case of a future resurgence of COVID-19, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

However, uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on April 26 and 27, 2021. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have improved on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. A pick-up in private consumption has paused due to increased downward pressure on consumption of has declined moderately. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food, and the same hereafter) has been slightly negative, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the past decline in crude oil prices. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. Japan's economy is likely to recover, although the level of economic activity, mainly in the face-to-face services sector, is expected to be lower than that prior to the pandemic for the time being. That is, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually and the economy being supported by an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures, a virtuous cycle from income to spending is expected to operate. Thereafter, as the impact subsides, the economy is projected to continue growing with the virtuous cycle intensifying. This baseline scenario is based on the assumption that, while taking preventive measures against COVID-19 and improving economic activity simultaneously, the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually and then almost subside in the middle of the projection period, due mainly to progress with vaccinations. The outlook also is based on the medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Looking at the outlook for economic activity based on the assumption and premises in more detail, overseas economies are likely to continue growing, albeit with variation across countries and regions, partly supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies is to decelerate time being, mainly automobile-related goods, goods exports are projected to continue increasing firmly, supported by a global recovery in business fixed investment and an expansion in digital-related demand. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry and travel restrictions continue but likely to recover thereafter. An uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear, mainly for supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures, although construction investment by the face-to-face services sector is projected to remain weak. Private consumption, mainly of face-to-face services, is likely to remain sluggish, being at a relatively low level for the time being due to the impact of COVID-19, but then it is expected to pick up again with the impact waning gradually and supported also by the government's economic measures. Thereafter, as the impact of COVID-19 subsides, an uptrend in private consumption, including that of face-to-face services, is projected to become evident with employee income improving. Employee income is likely to stop declining, reflecting improvement in corporate profits, and then increase moderately with a time lag following the recovery in domestic and external demand. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. Government consumption is likely to increase clearly for fiscal 2021, mainly reflecting but see a lowering in its level thereafter. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be slightly negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the reduction in mobile phone charges.2 That said, the reduction is a temporary factor, and when its effects are excluded, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to be steady. Although weakness in demand amid the situation of COVID-19 is projected to have an impact on prices, firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been and are not likely to be observed 2 The CPI forecasts in this Outlook Report are based on the current 2015-base index. The statistics authority that compiles the CPI has announced its plan to rebase the CPI to the base year of 2020 and retroactively revise its figures for the year-on-year rate of change from those for January 2021 onward, both in August 2021. With the rebasing, the reduction in mobile phone charges will have a larger impact than the current index, mainly because the weight of such charges in the CPI will rise. Therefore, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is highly likely to be revised downward for the 2020-base index. widely, given that one of the reasons for the decrease in demand is vigilance against COVID-19 and that there have been supply-side constraints and cost increases because of taking preventive measures against COVID-19. In addition, it is expected that the year-on-year rate of change in energy prices will turn positive on the back of a pick-up in crude oil prices since last autumn. Under these circumstances, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to be more or less unchanged. Thereafter, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually, mainly on the back of economic activity continuing to improve and the effects of the reduction in mobile phone charges dissipating. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are expected to rise again. Curve Control. It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March 2020 in response to the impact of COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets.3 The government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms. Private financial institutions have actively fulfilled the functioning of financial intermediation. In this situation, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen, the environment for has remained accommodative. Owing to the continuation of powerful monetary easing by the Bank, the government's measures, and efforts made by private financial institutions, the Bank considers that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay 3 See \"Enhancement of Monetary Easing in Light of the Impact of the Outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)\" released on March 16, 2020, \"Enhancement of Monetary Easing\" released on April 27, 2020, \"Introduction of a New Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Financing Mainly of Small and Medium-Sized Firms\" released on May 22, 2020, \"Statement on Monetary Policy\" released on December 18, 2020, in which the Bank made decisions such as on the extension of the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), and \"Further Effective and Sustainable Monetary Easing\" released on March 19, 2021. 4 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are high overseas economies. As the baseline scenario, it is assumed that the impact of COVID-19 will subside, mainly due to the vaccine rollout. However, the pace of such rollout and the effects of the vaccines entail uncertainties, and thus there is a risk that downward pressure on economic activity will increase. In addition, it is also uncertain how the varying paces of the vaccine rollout across countries and regions will affect global economic activity. On the other hand, with economic measures conducted particularly in recovery in domestic and overseas economies could be faster than expected. The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the impact of COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if the issue of COVID-19 leads to, for example, active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection and an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, thereby having positive effects on economic activity such as further innovation. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the government's measures to transform the economic structure The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although COVID-19 has affected the financial side as well, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation has been ensured.5 However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected accordingly. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are specific to prices. The first is uncertainties over firms' price-setting behavior amid the impact of COVID-19. As the baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, firms' price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been and are not likely to be observed widely, as described earlier. That said, including this aspect, firms' price-setting behavior entails uncertainties. The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates, international commodity These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario, and thus continue to warrant attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. For the time being, weakness in demand amid the situation of COVID-19 is expected to have an impact on prices, and medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to be more or less unchanged. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase gradually since upward pressure on them is projected to intensify at a gradual pace with the economy continuing to improve. In addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is highly unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the assumption that the impact of COVID-19 will wane gradually and then almost subside in the middle of the projection period. It also is based on the premises that, while the impact remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19, but are generally balanced for the middle of the projection period onward. Risks to prices are skewed to the downside. Looking at the current situation from the perspective of financial imbalances, the aggregate credit relative to the size of the economy has been increasing at a pace significantly above the past trend. This is because financial institutions have responded to demand for working capital, mainly by firms, which has increased due to the 6 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" impact of COVID-19, and the increase in the aggregate credit therefore does not seem to show overheating of financial activities. On this basis, when examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels. 5.0 to -4.9 [-4.9] 0.4 Forecasts made in January 2021 5.7 to -5.4 [-5.6] 0.7 to -0.5 [-0.5] Forecasts made in January 2021 Forecasts made in January 2021 Notes: 1.

While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, the rate of increase is projected to be pushed up through fiscal 2025 by factors such as a dissipation of the effects of the government's measures pushing down CPI inflation. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat lower, mainly due to the impact of the statistical revision to the GDP figures for fiscal 2023.

Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. In particular, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2025. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2024 and 2025. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 30 and 31, 2024. Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. Overseas economies have grown moderately on the whole. Exports and industrial production have been more or less flat. Corporate profits have improved and business sentiment has stayed at a favorable level. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has been resilient despite the impact of price rises and other factors. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been at around 2.5 percent recently, as services prices have continued to rise moderately, reflecting factors such as wage increases, although the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have waned. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies continuing to grow moderately and as a virtuous cycle from income Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat lower, mainly due to the impact of the statistical revision to the GDP figures for fiscal 2023. The projected growth rates for fiscal 2025 onward are more or less unchanged. In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Against this backdrop, for the time being, although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to increase moderately, mainly reflecting the rise in wage growth. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned, for the time being, by the government's 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. initiatives such as the continuation of measures to reduce the household burden of higher In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend, mainly due to a pick-up in global demand for IT-related goods, as overseas economies continue to grow moderately. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend with a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat. Government consumption is expected to increase moderately in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. While the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices are expected to wane, the rate of increase is projected to be pushed up through fiscal 2025 by factors such as a dissipation of the effects of the government's measures pushing down CPI inflation. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 is lower, mainly due to the effects of the government's measures to reduce the household and gas charges; on the other hand, that for fiscal 2025 is somewhat higher due to a dissipation of the effects of these measures. The projected rate of increase in this CPI for fiscal 2026 is more or less unchanged. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges had pushed down 2023. For fiscal 2024 and 2025, the phasing out of these measures is projected to push up the rates. Looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to decelerate, due to a gradual waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices, and subsequently be at around 2 percent. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend, albeit with fluctuations. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to widen moderately within positive territory toward the end of the projection period. Meanwhile, labor market conditions are expected to tighten to a greater extent than can be explained by the changes in the output gap, partly due to a deceleration in the on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. The June 2024 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that firms' inflation outlook for general prices has increased moderately. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and firm wage increases that were higher than those seen in the previous year were achieved in this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations. In addition, moves to reflect wage increases in selling prices have been strengthening. Regarding the outlook, inflation expectations are expected to rise moderately, with continued improvement in the output gap and changes in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, the virtuous cycle between wages and prices is projected to keep intensifying through achievement of wage increases that reflect price rises and through a pass-through of wage increases to selling prices. Considering the above assessments, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, mainly reflecting the improvement in the output gap and the rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations; in the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. That said, there remain uncertainties regarding this outlook, and it is necessary to carefully monitor factors such Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Inflation rates in the United States and Europe have followed a declining trend, albeit with fluctuations, and some central banks have started to slightly lower their policy interest rates. That said, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis and there is a risk of tight monetary policy being prolonged. Moreover, there are uncertainties over how past policy interest rate hikes by overseas central banks will affect their real economies and financial systems. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. Meanwhile, depending on factors such as the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine and the Middle East, downward pressure on overseas economies could heighten. In addition, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets, and it is necessary to pay attention to how inventory adjustment pressure on some goods will The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, including grains. Attention continues to be warranted on the risk that prices of grains and other commodities will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. Moreover, with progress in the pass-through of the rise in import strengthen further, and this could push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is the impact of various changes in the environment surrounding Japan on firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations and on Japan's potential growth rate. It is expected that factors such as the experience of COVID-19, intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization and on labor market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Intensifying labor shortages -- which are partly due to demographic changes -- could accelerate labor-saving investment, such as for digitalization. On the other hand, if such a substitution of labor with capital does not sufficiently progress, there is a risk that supply-side constraints in some industries will push down the growth rate. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. While firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, there remain uncertainties over the extent to which moves to reflect wage developments in selling prices will become widespread. It is expected in the baseline scenario that the virtuous cycle between wages and prices will continue to intensify. However, given that firms, especially small and medium-sized firms, have continued to report that it has been difficult to pass on their employees' higher wages to their selling prices, the rise in selling prices could be limited. Since the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in Japanese society for a prolonged period, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether moves to pass on increases in wages and other costs to selling prices will weaken with the waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. On the other hand, moves to reflect wages in selling prices could strengthen to a greater extent than expected, and upward pressure on wages could intensify with labor market conditions tightening. In this situation, there is also a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario, accompanied by a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. In addition, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2024 and then be at around 2 percent for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that the output gap will improve and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with the virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing to intensify. In the second half of the projection period, it is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There remain high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2025. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has generally not been seen in asset prices was seen for a time and valuations of some properties seem to have been relatively high in the real estate market. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" abroad and in global financial markets, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. Moreover, financial institutions' resilience to rises in yen interest rates has headed toward improvement, mainly reflecting their portfolio rebalancing in securities investment. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, while it will depend on developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions going forward, given that real interest rates are at significantly low levels, if the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized, the Bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation.

It is based mainly on the assumptions that a second wave of COVID-19 will not occur on a large scale and that, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, these assumptions entail high uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 14 and 15, 2020. Japan's economy has been in an extremely severe situation with the impact of COVID-19 remaining at home and abroad, although economic activity has resumed gradually. Overseas economies have been depressed significantly, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although they have shown signs of heading toward a pick-up. In this situation, exports and industrial production have declined substantially. Corporate profits and business sentiment have deteriorated, and business fixed investment has been more or less flat. With the continuing impact of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has been weak. Although private consumption has decreased significantly, mainly in services such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations, it has shown signs of a pick-up recently. Housing investment has declined moderately. Meanwhile, investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but those for corporate financing have remained less so, as seen in deterioration in firms' financial positions. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food, and the same hereafter) is at around 0 percent, mainly affected by the decline in crude oil prices. Inflation expectations have weakened somewhat. Japan's economy, with economic activity resuming, is likely to improve gradually from the second half of this year through the materialization of pent-up demand and supported by the pace of improvement is expected to be only moderate while the impact of COVID-19 remains worldwide. Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth path. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on the global economy, along with the conduct of strict public health measures such as restrictions on going outside and suspension of business and production activities. A phased lifting of these measures has begun, mainly in countries where the spread of COVID-19 has almost subsided, but economic activities of firms and households have remained constrained due to vigilance against COVID-19. In this Outlook Report, which is based on the assumption that a second wave of COVID-19 will not occur on a large scale, it is expected that, until COVID-19 subsides globally, precautionary efforts made voluntarily by firms and households will continue to act as a force constraining economic activity, although it will Based on this assumption, as the impact of COVID-19 wanes, overseas economies are likely to recover from being depressed significantly, partly supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies, but the pace is expected to be only moderate. Japan's exports are likely to increase gradually along with a recovery in overseas economies but remain constrained for the time being. Inbound tourism consumption is expected to remain subdued while entry restrictions continue. Domestic demand is likely to see an increase in its level as the impact of COVID-19 wanes, but be only at a low level while it remains. Specifically, along with a resumption of economic activity, household spending such as private consumption is expected to pick supported by the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions. However, the spending is likely to remain constrained while people continue to be vigilant against COVID-19. Business spending, such as business fixed investment, is expected to decrease, mainly in industries affected strongly by substantial declines in exports and consumption. Thereafter, it is likely to pick up as the impact of COVID-19 Meanwhile, it is expected that the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions will contribute to sustaining businesses and retaining employees, thereby preventing firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations in Japan from declining substantially. Thus, as the impact of COVID-19 subsides globally thereafter, it is likely that exports will continue to increase on the back of growth in overseas economies and that household and business spending will return to a stable increasing trend. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the past decline in crude oil prices. With economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, it is expected that prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity will be pushed down. Crude oil prices, which declined significantly compared to a while ago, are projected to push down the CPI through energy prices. Under these circumstances, medium- to long-term 2 According to the global economic outlook released by various international organizations, it is assumed, as a baseline scenario, that the economy will recover from the second half of 2020 after being pushed down significantly in the first half of the year by the rapid spread of COVID-19. In that scenario, which is based on the assumption that a second wave of COVID-19 will not occur on a large scale, an economic recovery is expected to be only moderate since preventive measures, including voluntary ones, are likely to continue to be taken until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides due to medical breakthroughs such as development of effective medicines and vaccines. inflation expectations are likely to continue weakening somewhat. Thereafter, downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement. In addition, the effects of the decline in energy prices are likely to dissipate. Under these circumstances, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are expected to rise again. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, corporate financing has been under stress, mainly against the background of a decline in sales that reflects constrained economic activity due to the spread of COVID-19. In response to this with Yield Curve Control,\" has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets.3 In addition, the government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms, through programs that provide loans guaranteed by the credit guarantee corporations and that provide quasi-capital funds. In this situation, along with active efforts made by private financial institutions, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, has remained accommodative. Owing to the Bank's and the government's measures, as well as efforts made by private financial institutions together with those measures, it is expected that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are their impact on domestic and overseas economies. Until effective medicines and vaccines 4 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. are developed, it is highly unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve and how long it will take for it to subside. In particular, if a second wave of COVID-19 occurs on a large scale, economic activity is likely to be constrained significantly again. In addition, households' and firms' behavior at home and abroad is also uncertain, with people continuing to voluntarily make precautionary efforts until COVID-19 subsides. The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if the issue of COVID-19 leads to, for example, active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection and an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, thereby having positive effects on The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although it is under severe stress due to the impact of COVID-19, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively, with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole. However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be Risks that are specific to prices are as follows. The first is uncertainties over firms' of economic activity. A decrease in demand due to constrained economic activity is likely to push down prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity. On the other hand, there are uncertainties over how firms set prices if economic activity is constrained also from the supply side, such as by limiting the number of customers to prevent infection. In addition, it is unclear how these circumstances will affect prices from The second is that future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices, may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. In particular, since crude oil prices have been highly volatile, it is necessary to pay attention to the effects on the CPI exerted through energy prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. For the time being, prices are expected to be pushed down with economic activity remiaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, and medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to weaken somewhat. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase gradually since downward pressure on them is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement. In addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. This outlook is based mainly on the assumptions that a second wave of COVID-19 will not occur on a large long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, these assumptions entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary 5 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Thereafter, Japan's economic growth rate is likely to rise, with overseas economies returning to a moderate growth path. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to be in the range of 2.0-2.5 percent for fiscal 2025, in the range of 1.5-2.0 percent for fiscal 2026, and at around 2 percent for fiscal 2027. The effects of the past rise in import prices and of the recent rise in food prices such as rice prices -- these factors have pushed up the inflation rate so far -- are expected to wane. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be sluggish, mainly due to the deceleration in the economy. Thereafter, however, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that a sense of labor shortage will grow as the economic growth rate rises, and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. \uf06c Comparing the projections through fiscal 2026 with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat higher, but the projected growth rates for fiscal 2025 and 2026 are lower due to the effects of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction. The projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2025 and 2026 are lower, mainly reflecting the decline in crude oil prices and the downward revision of the GDP growth rates. \uf06c There are various risks to the outlook. In particular, it is extremely uncertain how trade and other policies in each jurisdiction will evolve and how overseas economic activity and prices will react to them. It is therefore necessary to pay due attention to the impact of these developments on financial and foreign exchange markets and on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Risks to prices are also skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. Overseas economies have grown moderately on the whole, although some weakness has been seen in part, reflecting trade and other policies in each jurisdiction. Exports and industrial production have continued to be more or less flat as a trend, although there has been some front-loading due to the increase in U.S. tariffs. Corporate profits have been on an improving trend and business sentiment has stayed at a favorable level. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. Private consumption has maintained its moderate increasing trend against the Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been in the range of 3.0-3.5 percent recently, as moves to pass on wage increases to selling prices have continued, and as there have been effects of the past rise in import prices and of the rise in food prices, such as rice prices. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economic growth is likely to moderate, as trade and other policies in each conditions are expected to provide support. Exports and production are likely to show some weakness, against the background of the slowdown in overseas economies. Reflecting these developments, corporate profits are also likely to decrease, while being at high levels. In this situation, the growth rate of business fixed investment is likely to decelerate, affected by the slowdown in overseas economies, although it is expected that investment to address labor shortages, digital-related investment, research and development (R&D) investment related to growth areas and decarbonization, and investment associated with strengthening supply chains 2 There are extremely high uncertainties regarding the future course of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction and the impact of these policies on economic activity and prices at home and abroad. The baseline scenario in this Outlook Report is developed based on assumptions including the following: negotiations between jurisdictions will progress to some extent, and significant disruptions of global supply chains will be avoided. Attention is warranted on the possibility that the outlook for economic activity and prices could change considerably depending on the future course of the policies in each jurisdiction and the response of firms and households in these jurisdictions to the policies. 3 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. will continue and that accommodative financial conditions will provide support. Regarding market conditions are likely to remain tight, as it will become more difficult for labor supply of women and seniors to increase. Against this backdrop, the growth rate of nominal wages is likely to remain high for the time being, reflecting factors such as the outcome of wages are highly likely to continue increasing, although the growth rate is likely to decelerate somewhat, affected by the decline in corporate profits. Although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises for the time being, it is projected to maintain its moderate increasing trend, mainly due to a continued rise in employee income. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned by the government's initiatives such as the measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices and the tax reform in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat, and government consumption is expected to increase moderately in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Thereafter, Japan's economic growth rate is likely to rise, with overseas economies returning to a moderate growth path. Exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend. Corporate profits are likely to improve with an increase in domestic and external demand, and business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, partly due to investment for capacity expansion to address the rise in demand. Looking at the employment and income situation, the growth rate of nominal wages is expected to accelerate again, with a growing sense of labor shortage, and private consumption is projected to increase moderately. Comparing the projections through fiscal 2026 with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat higher, mainly led by private consumption. The projected growth rates for fiscal 2025 and 2026 are lower due to the effects of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.4 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. Potential growth is likely to be supported by the 4 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be around 0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are high uncertainties over how factors such as advances in digitalization will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be in the at around 2 percent for fiscal 2027. The effects of the past rise in import prices and of the recent rise in food prices such as rice prices -- these factors have pushed up the inflation rate so far -- are expected to wane. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be sluggish, mainly due to the deceleration in the economy. Thereafter, however, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that a sense of labor shortage will grow as the economic growth rate rises, and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. Comparing the projections through fiscal 2026 with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2025 and 2026 are lower, mainly reflecting the decline in crude oil The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to be more in futures markets. Looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to be temporarily below 2 percent because it is expected that the effects of the past wane and that this CPI will be affected by factors such as the deceleration in the economy. Thereafter, however, the rate of increase in this CPI is likely to be at around 2 percent as The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend, albeit with fluctuations. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, it is likely that the gap will remain at around the current level, but will improve again toward the end of the projection period. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have tightened to a greater extent than can be explained by the changes in the output gap, partly due to a this situation, upward pressure on wages and prices is likely to be stronger than suggested by the output gap, given that firms in many industries have started to face labor Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. Regarding the outlook, although it is projected that firms will maintain their active wage- and price-setting behavior and will continue their moves to reflect higher costs -- including increased personnel expenses and distribution costs -- in selling prices, inflation expectations are expected to be sluggish, mainly due to the deceleration in the economy. Thereafter, as the economic growth rate rises and labor market conditions tighten notably, it is expected that firm's active wage- and price-setting behavior will become more widespread, and that inflation expectations will rise moderately again. Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is the evolving situation regarding trade and other policies in each jurisdiction and policy recently announced in each jurisdiction is likely to push down domestic and overseas economies through various channels. The introduction of wide-ranging tariffs is expected to impact global trade activity, and the heightened uncertainties regarding policies including tariffs are likely to have a large impact on business and household sentiment around the world and on global financial and capital markets. The impact that these policies have on domestic and overseas economies and the degree of the impact will depend largely on the future course of these policies, and therefore it is necessary to pay due attention to their developments. Meanwhile, depending on factors such as the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine and the Middle East, downward pressure on overseas economies could heighten. Regarding the Chinese economy, there remain high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of growth, including the effects of government policies, as adjustment pressure has continued in the real estate and labor markets. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to how excessive supply capacity of some goods -- coupled with the effects of trade policies -- will affect global economic activity and The second risk is developments in import prices. Reflecting the aforementioned effects of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction, if disruptions in global logistics were to arise or moves to restructure supply chains were to take place and incur considerable costs, import prices could rise, and this could in turn push down domestic demand. In addition, attention continues to be warranted on the risk that prices of grains and other commodities will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Moreover, if import prices were to rise significantly, households' defensive attitudes toward spending could strengthen further, and this could push down the economy. On the other hand, if import prices decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is the impact of various changes in the environment surrounding Japan on firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations and on Japan's potential growth rate. It is expected that factors such as the experience of COVID-19, intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization and on labor market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Intensifying labor shortages -- which are partly due to demographic changes -- could accelerate labor-saving investment, such as for digitalization. On the other hand, if such a substitution of labor with capital does not sufficiently progress, there is a risk that supply-side constraints in some industries will push down the growth rate. Furthermore, the trade policy recently announced in each jurisdiction could trigger a change in the trend of globalization, and depending on the future course of these policies, this change may accelerate. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is firms' wage- and price-setting behavior and its impact on inflation expectations. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and it is expected in the baseline scenario that this trend will be maintained, despite the deceleration in the economy. However, a prolonged period of high uncertainties regarding trade and other policies in each jurisdiction could lead firms to focus more on cost cutting. As a result, moves to reflect price rises in wages could also weaken. On the other hand, moves to reflect wages in selling prices could strengthen to a greater extent than expected, and upward pressure on wages could intensify with growing expectations that labor market conditions will continue to be tight. In this situation, there is also a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario, accompanied by a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Meanwhile, with regard to the recent rise in food prices, such as rice prices, even when price rises themselves mainly result from weather conditions, attention is warranted on the possibility that these rises may induce second-round effects on underlying CPI inflation through changes in household sentiment The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and import prices, including international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over the outlook for the global economy, including the future course of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction, which could lead to a rise in import prices from the supply side or to this regard, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be in the range of 2.0-2.5 percent for fiscal 2027. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be sluggish, mainly due to the deceleration in the economy. Thereafter, however, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that a sense of labor shortage will grow as the economic growth rate rises, and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There are various risks surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices. In particular, it is extremely uncertain how trade and other policies in each jurisdiction will evolve and how overseas economic activity and prices will react to them. It is therefore necessary to pay due attention to the impact of these developments With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Risks to prices are also skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025 and Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has generally not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities, although attention continues to be warranted on the pace of increase in real estate prices. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. In addition, even in the case of an adjustment in the real economy at home and abroad and in global financial markets, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. In this regard, given the extremely high uncertainties regarding 5 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" trade and other policies in each jurisdiction, it is necessary to carefully monitor the impact these policies have on the financial system through various channels.6 As for the conduct of monetary policy, given that real interest rates are at significantly low levels, if the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized, the Bank, in accordance with improvement in economic activity and prices, will continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. In this regard, considering the extremely high uncertainties regarding the future course of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction and the impact of these policies, it is important for the Bank to carefully examine factors such as developments in economic activity and will be realized, without any preconceptions. With the price stability target of 2 percent, the Bank will conduct monetary policy as appropriate, in response to developments in Forecasts made in January 2025 Forecasts made in January 2025 Forecasts made in January 2025 Notes: 1.

In fiscal 2025, Japan's economic growth is likely to moderate to around the same level as the potential growth rate, since it is projected that heightened uncertainties, and that these factors will push down domestic and external demand.

Among the countries and regions that the United States has trade deficits with, Japan ranks 6th in terms of the size of the deficit, as of 2024, with the top three deficits being Japan's trade statistics show that the total volume was 21.3 trillion yen, or 3.5 percent of Japan's exports from Japan to the United States was exports being high value-added motor vehicles, on which an additional 25 percent U.S. tariff has been imposed (Chart B1-4).

The firm-level distribution of starting salaries shows that, while the dispersion was relatively narrow peak at around 210,000 yen. In the past few years, however, the distribution has shifted clearly to the right, and the share of firms in the upper tail has increased (Chart B4-2). The hike in starting salaries is considered to also lead to a hike in are close to those of new graduates on the wage curve. If firms further revise their seniority-based wage curves upward, based on the hike in starting salaries, overall wage levels may also rise.

Specifically, point-of-sale (POS) data was used to compile firm-level average price of products sold by individual firms, which was then matched with firm-level microdata analysis shows that the decline in sales quantities products was smaller than before the COVID-19 pandemic (Chart B4-4[1]).34 This suggests the possibility that there has been a decline in the demand (a value that shows the percentage firm's product is raised by 1 percent). Moreover, in firms that have raised their sales prices tend to have increased,35 suggesting that these firms' profit per unit sold (unit profit) may have also been rising (Chart B4-4[2]). In addition, labor costs per employee of firms that have raised their sales prices indicate that, recently, firms that have raised prices more have a higher rate of increase in wages (Chart B4-4[3]). These findings suggest that, at present, a mechanism is at work whereby firms that are able to raise their price markups are also increasing wage payments with some time lag, and this pattern may be spreading to small 33 For the calculation of the average sales price of each firm, principal components obtained from various sales prices of the firm was used. 34 Using a standard individual demand curve, the change in sales volumes due to a change in the relative price of firms' products was examined while controlling for the macroeconomic inflation environment and other factors using time-fixed effects. 35 Price markups are calculated in this box as \"sales / total cost of goods sold\" following previous studies. 1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.0 Dependent variable: Personnel expenses per employee (y/y chg.)Explanatory variable: Average price of a firm's products (y/y chg.,2-quarter lag) ", "file40": "(English translation prepared by the Bank's staff based on the Japanese original) Please contact the Bank of Japan at the address below in advance to request permission when reproducing or copying the content of this document for commercial purposes.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to increase toward the end of this year due to rises in prices of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. The rate of increase is then expected to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023 because the contribution of such price rises to this CPI is likely to wane. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected growth rates are somewhat lower, mainly for fiscal 2022, due to the effects of the spread of COVID-19 this summer and of slowdowns in overseas economies. The projected rates of increase in the CPI are higher, mainly for fiscal 2022, due to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices; and the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact. In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 27 and 28, 2022. Japan's economy, despite being affected by factors such as high commodity prices, has picked up as the resumption of economic activity has progressed while public health has been protected from COVID-19. Overseas economies have recovered moderately on the whole, but slowdowns have been observed, mainly in advanced economies. Exports and industrial production have increased as a trend, with the effects of supply-side constraints waning. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has been more or less unchanged. In this situation, business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole. Private consumption has increased moderately, despite being affected by COVID-19. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been at around 3 percent due to rises in prices of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen. Toward the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning and with support from it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from high commodity prices and Slowdowns have been observed in overseas economies, with inflationary pressure exerted on a global basis and central banks thereby continuing to raise policy interest wheat) have turned to a decline on the whole, past rises in these prices have brought about an outflow of income from (i.e., trading losses for) Japan, which relies on imports for most of these commodities, and have put downward pressure on households' real income and corporate profits through rises in energy and food prices. Japan's economy is projected to be under such downward pressure stemming from the slowdowns in overseas economies and the outflow of income, but is likely to recover because a self-sustaining increase in demand, including pent-up demand, is projected to continue with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning. Moreover, the government's various measures are expected to mitigate the negative impact on income. In the household sector, regarding the employment situation, the number of regular is likely to become evident with a recovery in the face-to-face services sector. In addition, wage growth is expected to increase, reflecting improvement in labor market conditions. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing moderately. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be under downward pressure from the real income side due to price rises, it is projected to continue increasing. This is mainly because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions, as the resumption of consumption activities progresses further while public health is being protected. In the corporate sector, although overseas economies, particularly advanced economies, are projected to slow, exports and production are likely to remain on an uptrend with the effects of supply-side constraints waning and with support from high levels of order backlogs for automobiles and capital goods. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is also expected to increase, mainly in reflection of the government's relaxation of entry restrictions. Although high raw material costs are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, albeit with variation across industries and firm sizes. This will likely occur situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear as accommodative financial conditions provide support and supply-side constraints wane. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline gradually in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19. From the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually because the contribution of the materialization of pent-up demand is projected to wane. In the household sector, employee income is likely to continue increasing on the back of a moderate rise in the number of employees associated with improvement in economic activity and of an increase in wage growth that reflects tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Supported by this increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing steadily, although the materialization of pent-up demand is likely to slow. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to increase moderately with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor shortage, digital-related investment, and Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to continue on an improving trend along Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase durable goods. The rate of increase is then expected to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023 because the contribution of such price rises to this CPI is likely to wane. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth. Looking at the projected developments in this CPI by fiscal year, the rate of change is expected to be relatively high at around 3 percent for fiscal 2022 and then be at around 1.5 percent for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, reflecting price in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is likely to see similar developments to The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. With Japan's economy following a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, the gap is 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. projected to turn positive around the second half of fiscal 2022 and then continue to expand moderately. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify gradually. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen, albeit at a moderate pace relative to short-term ones. The September 2022 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has increased further and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, an increase in actual inflation is expected to bring about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations labor-management wage negotiations, lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, there are extremely high uncertainties, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in Specifically, it is necessary to pay attention to the following upside and downside risks. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Amid ongoing inflationary pressure on a global basis, central banks have raised policy interest rates rapidly, and moves to tighten monetary policy, including a reduction in monetary accommodation, are projected to continue for the time being. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow moderately, albeit at a decelerating pace. That said, vigilance against a wage-price spiral has heightened, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. With central banks continuing to make rapid policy interest rate hikes, there is a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further through adjustments in emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking this risk into account, it is necessary to pay The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the course of this situation, overseas economies, particularly the euro area, could be pushed down further. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined compared with a while ago, they could rise again depending on, for example, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine. Given that Japan is a commodity importer, a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. Such deterioration in the terms of trade squeezes corporate profits and households' real income, and this could lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. On this point, in the baseline scenario, commodity prices are assumed to decline moderately on the whole toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. However, there are surrounding Ukraine -- and global efforts toward addressing climate change. The third factor is how COVID-19 at home and abroad will affect private consumption and firms' export and production activities. COVID-19 resurged in Japan this summer, but its impact on the economy has remained small relative to past phases of COVID-19 surges, and the resumption of consumption activities has progressed steadily while public health has been protected. That said, depending on the course of COVID-19, upward pressure from pent-up demand could weaken by more than expected. On the other hand, if that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions could be withdrawn by more than expected and private consumption could be pushed up. In the meantime, supply-side constraints have remained in part, and if COVID-19 resurges at home and abroad in this situation, such constraints could intensify again through, for example, supply-chain disruptions. If this happens, Japan's exports and production could be pushed down and the adverse impact could even spill over to goods consumption and business fixed The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that efforts with a view to the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization, and decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. In addition, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how households and firms react to these changes, their could go either upward or downward. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. Recently, against the backdrop of high raw material costs, price hikes have been widely observed even among firms that had taken a cautious stance toward changing their selling prices, while their pricing decisions have been made in consideration of price setting by competitors. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through of cost increases could accelerate by more than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, there is a possibility that wages and prices will rise by more than expected as more firms reflect price developments in wage setting through labor-management wage negotiations. On the other hand, given that, in Japan, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily are deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen and prices will deviate The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Fluctuations in international commodity prices have been significant, reflecting high uncertainties over, for example, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, while inflation rates have remained high on a global basis and foreign exchange markets have fluctuated sharply. How these factors will affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. Although it will take time, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually as an underlying trend toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Figures for the first half of fiscal 2022 are those for 2022/Q2. The potential growth rate seems to have been in This is because, although the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP) has increased slightly, working hours have continued on a downtrend, reflecting working-style reforms, and growth in capital stock has decelerated as a result of past declines in business fixed investment. As for the outlook, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately. This is based on the projection allocation, (2) the pace of decline in working hours will slow with the effects of working-style reforms diminishing, and (3) growth in capital developments are likely to be encouraged by the terms of labor, it is highly uncertain what kind of working style, including working from home, will take hold as the resumption of economic activity progresses while public health is being protected. In addition, in the corporate sector, there remain aim at adapting to the post-pandemic economic and industrial structures, including efforts toward digitalization and addressing climate change. the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some latitude. Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In the second half of fiscal 2022, Japan's economy is likely to recover. This is because, although the economy is expected to be under stemming economies, it is projected that the impact of COVID-19 on services consumption will wane ease. Another reason is that accommodative economic measures are likely to provide support. Specifically, while goods exports are likely to be affected by economies, they are expected to remain on an Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is projected to increase. Private consumption is expected to be pushed employment situation, it is projected to continue increasing because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related activities progresses further while public health is being protected. With corporate profits being at fixed investment is expected to become clear on government spending is projected to decrease somewhat. This is because, although expenditure related to COVID-19 is expected to remain at a economic measures, public investment is likely to decrease, given that the implementation of the fiscal 2022 budget for it was front-loaded in the economy is projected to remain relatively high, partly supported by accommodative conditions. However, with the remaining effects of the slowdowns in overseas economies, it is likely to decelerate somewhat, mainly reflecting slower measures. Japan's goods exports are projected to constraints dissipate, although such exports will likely continue to be affected by the slowdowns in overseas economies. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor shortage, growth areas and to address environmental issues. Private consumption is also expected to keep increasing. This is based on the projection that employee income will continue improving and pent-up demand will continue to materialize, construction related to building national resilience expenditures are to provide support, government spending is expected to decline, reflecting a reduction in expenditure related to growth is likely to decelerate, mainly due to a waning of pent-up demand, Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at a pace above its financial conditions being maintained.

It is based mainly on the assumptions that a second wave of COVID-19 will not occur on a large scale and that, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, these assumptions entail high uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 14 and 15, 2020. Japan's economy has been in an extremely severe situation with the impact of COVID-19 remaining at home and abroad, although economic activity has resumed gradually. Overseas economies have been depressed significantly, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, although they have shown signs of heading toward a pick-up. In this situation, exports and industrial production have declined substantially. Corporate profits and business sentiment have deteriorated, and business fixed investment has been more or less flat. With the continuing impact of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has been weak. Although private consumption has decreased significantly, mainly in services such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations, it has shown signs of a pick-up recently. Housing investment has declined moderately. Meanwhile, investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but those for corporate financing have remained less so, as seen in deterioration in firms' financial positions. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food, and the same hereafter) is at around 0 percent, mainly affected by the decline in crude oil prices. Inflation expectations have weakened somewhat. Japan's economy, with economic activity resuming, is likely to improve gradually from the second half of this year through the materialization of pent-up demand and supported by the pace of improvement is expected to be only moderate while the impact of COVID-19 remains worldwide. Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth path. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on the global economy, along with the conduct of strict public health measures such as restrictions on going outside and suspension of business and production activities. A phased lifting of these measures has begun, mainly in countries where the spread of COVID-19 has almost subsided, but economic activities of firms and households have remained constrained due to vigilance against COVID-19. In this Outlook Report, which is based on the assumption that a second wave of COVID-19 will not occur on a large scale, it is expected that, until COVID-19 subsides globally, precautionary efforts made voluntarily by firms and households will continue to act as a force constraining economic activity, although it will Based on this assumption, as the impact of COVID-19 wanes, overseas economies are likely to recover from being depressed significantly, partly supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies, but the pace is expected to be only moderate. Japan's exports are likely to increase gradually along with a recovery in overseas economies but remain constrained for the time being. Inbound tourism consumption is expected to remain subdued while entry restrictions continue. Domestic demand is likely to see an increase in its level as the impact of COVID-19 wanes, but be only at a low level while it remains. Specifically, along with a resumption of economic activity, household spending such as private consumption is expected to pick supported by the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions. However, the spending is likely to remain constrained while people continue to be vigilant against COVID-19. Business spending, such as business fixed investment, is expected to decrease, mainly in industries affected strongly by substantial declines in exports and consumption. Thereafter, it is likely to pick up as the impact of COVID-19 Meanwhile, it is expected that the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions will contribute to sustaining businesses and retaining employees, thereby preventing firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations in Japan from declining substantially. Thus, as the impact of COVID-19 subsides globally thereafter, it is likely that exports will continue to increase on the back of growth in overseas economies and that household and business spending will return to a stable increasing trend. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the past decline in crude oil prices. With economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, it is expected that prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity will be pushed down. Crude oil prices, which declined significantly compared to a while ago, are projected to push down the CPI through energy prices. Under these circumstances, medium- to long-term 2 According to the global economic outlook released by various international organizations, it is assumed, as a baseline scenario, that the economy will recover from the second half of 2020 after being pushed down significantly in the first half of the year by the rapid spread of COVID-19. In that scenario, which is based on the assumption that a second wave of COVID-19 will not occur on a large scale, an economic recovery is expected to be only moderate since preventive measures, including voluntary ones, are likely to continue to be taken until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides due to medical breakthroughs such as development of effective medicines and vaccines. inflation expectations are likely to continue weakening somewhat. Thereafter, downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement. In addition, the effects of the decline in energy prices are likely to dissipate. Under these circumstances, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are expected to rise again. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, corporate financing has been under stress, mainly against the background of a decline in sales that reflects constrained economic activity due to the spread of COVID-19. In response to this with Yield Curve Control,\" has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets.3 In addition, the government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms, through programs that provide loans guaranteed by the credit guarantee corporations and that provide quasi-capital funds. In this situation, along with active efforts made by private financial institutions, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, has remained accommodative. Owing to the Bank's and the government's measures, as well as efforts made by private financial institutions together with those measures, it is expected that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are their impact on domestic and overseas economies. Until effective medicines and vaccines 4 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. are developed, it is highly unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve and how long it will take for it to subside. In particular, if a second wave of COVID-19 occurs on a large scale, economic activity is likely to be constrained significantly again. In addition, households' and firms' behavior at home and abroad is also uncertain, with people continuing to voluntarily make precautionary efforts until COVID-19 subsides. The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if the issue of COVID-19 leads to, for example, active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection and an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, thereby having positive effects on The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although it is under severe stress due to the impact of COVID-19, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively, with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole. However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be Risks that are specific to prices are as follows. The first is uncertainties over firms' of economic activity. A decrease in demand due to constrained economic activity is likely to push down prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity. On the other hand, there are uncertainties over how firms set prices if economic activity is constrained also from the supply side, such as by limiting the number of customers to prevent infection. In addition, it is unclear how these circumstances will affect prices from The second is that future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices, may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. In particular, since crude oil prices have been highly volatile, it is necessary to pay attention to the effects on the CPI exerted through energy prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. For the time being, prices are expected to be pushed down with economic activity remiaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, and medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to weaken somewhat. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase gradually since downward pressure on them is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement. In addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. This outlook is based mainly on the assumptions that a second wave of COVID-19 will not occur on a large long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, these assumptions entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary 5 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Thereafter, Japan's economic growth rate is likely to rise, with overseas economies returning to a moderate growth path. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to be in the range of 2.0-2.5 percent for fiscal 2025, in the range of 1.5-2.0 percent for fiscal 2026, and at around 2 percent for fiscal 2027. The effects of the past rise in import prices and of the recent rise in food prices such as rice prices -- these factors have pushed up the inflation rate so far -- are expected to wane. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be sluggish, mainly due to the deceleration in the economy. Thereafter, however, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that a sense of labor shortage will grow as the economic growth rate rises, and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. \uf06c Comparing the projections through fiscal 2026 with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat higher, but the projected growth rates for fiscal 2025 and 2026 are lower due to the effects of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction. The projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2025 and 2026 are lower, mainly reflecting the decline in crude oil prices and the downward revision of the GDP growth rates. \uf06c There are various risks to the outlook. In particular, it is extremely uncertain how trade and other policies in each jurisdiction will evolve and how overseas economic activity and prices will react to them. It is therefore necessary to pay due attention to the impact of these developments on financial and foreign exchange markets and on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Risks to prices are also skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Japan's economy has recovered moderately, although some weakness has been seen in part. Overseas economies have grown moderately on the whole, although some weakness has been seen in part, reflecting trade and other policies in each jurisdiction. Exports and industrial production have continued to be more or less flat as a trend, although there has been some front-loading due to the increase in U.S. tariffs. Corporate profits have been on an improving trend and business sentiment has stayed at a favorable level. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. Private consumption has maintained its moderate increasing trend against the Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been in the range of 3.0-3.5 percent recently, as moves to pass on wage increases to selling prices have continued, and as there have been effects of the past rise in import prices and of the rise in food prices, such as rice prices. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economic growth is likely to moderate, as trade and other policies in each conditions are expected to provide support. Exports and production are likely to show some weakness, against the background of the slowdown in overseas economies. Reflecting these developments, corporate profits are also likely to decrease, while being at high levels. In this situation, the growth rate of business fixed investment is likely to decelerate, affected by the slowdown in overseas economies, although it is expected that investment to address labor shortages, digital-related investment, research and development (R&D) investment related to growth areas and decarbonization, and investment associated with strengthening supply chains 2 There are extremely high uncertainties regarding the future course of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction and the impact of these policies on economic activity and prices at home and abroad. The baseline scenario in this Outlook Report is developed based on assumptions including the following: negotiations between jurisdictions will progress to some extent, and significant disruptions of global supply chains will be avoided. Attention is warranted on the possibility that the outlook for economic activity and prices could change considerably depending on the future course of the policies in each jurisdiction and the response of firms and households in these jurisdictions to the policies. 3 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. will continue and that accommodative financial conditions will provide support. Regarding market conditions are likely to remain tight, as it will become more difficult for labor supply of women and seniors to increase. Against this backdrop, the growth rate of nominal wages is likely to remain high for the time being, reflecting factors such as the outcome of wages are highly likely to continue increasing, although the growth rate is likely to decelerate somewhat, affected by the decline in corporate profits. Although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises for the time being, it is projected to maintain its moderate increasing trend, mainly due to a continued rise in employee income. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned by the government's initiatives such as the measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices and the tax reform in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat, and government consumption is expected to increase moderately in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Thereafter, Japan's economic growth rate is likely to rise, with overseas economies returning to a moderate growth path. Exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend. Corporate profits are likely to improve with an increase in domestic and external demand, and business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, partly due to investment for capacity expansion to address the rise in demand. Looking at the employment and income situation, the growth rate of nominal wages is expected to accelerate again, with a growing sense of labor shortage, and private consumption is projected to increase moderately. Comparing the projections through fiscal 2026 with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat higher, mainly led by private consumption. The projected growth rates for fiscal 2025 and 2026 are lower due to the effects of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction. Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.4 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. Potential growth is likely to be supported by the 4 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be around 0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are high uncertainties over how factors such as advances in digitalization will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be in the at around 2 percent for fiscal 2027. The effects of the past rise in import prices and of the recent rise in food prices such as rice prices -- these factors have pushed up the inflation rate so far -- are expected to wane. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be sluggish, mainly due to the deceleration in the economy. Thereafter, however, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that a sense of labor shortage will grow as the economic growth rate rises, and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. Comparing the projections through fiscal 2026 with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2025 and 2026 are lower, mainly reflecting the decline in crude oil The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to be more in futures markets. Looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to be temporarily below 2 percent because it is expected that the effects of the past wane and that this CPI will be affected by factors such as the deceleration in the economy. Thereafter, however, the rate of increase in this CPI is likely to be at around 2 percent as The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend, albeit with fluctuations. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, it is likely that the gap will remain at around the current level, but will improve again toward the end of the projection period. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have tightened to a greater extent than can be explained by the changes in the output gap, partly due to a this situation, upward pressure on wages and prices is likely to be stronger than suggested by the output gap, given that firms in many industries have started to face labor Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. Regarding the outlook, although it is projected that firms will maintain their active wage- and price-setting behavior and will continue their moves to reflect higher costs -- including increased personnel expenses and distribution costs -- in selling prices, inflation expectations are expected to be sluggish, mainly due to the deceleration in the economy. Thereafter, as the economic growth rate rises and labor market conditions tighten notably, it is expected that firm's active wage- and price-setting behavior will become more widespread, and that inflation expectations will rise moderately again. Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is the evolving situation regarding trade and other policies in each jurisdiction and policy recently announced in each jurisdiction is likely to push down domestic and overseas economies through various channels. The introduction of wide-ranging tariffs is expected to impact global trade activity, and the heightened uncertainties regarding policies including tariffs are likely to have a large impact on business and household sentiment around the world and on global financial and capital markets. The impact that these policies have on domestic and overseas economies and the degree of the impact will depend largely on the future course of these policies, and therefore it is necessary to pay due attention to their developments. Meanwhile, depending on factors such as the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine and the Middle East, downward pressure on overseas economies could heighten. Regarding the Chinese economy, there remain high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of growth, including the effects of government policies, as adjustment pressure has continued in the real estate and labor markets. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to how excessive supply capacity of some goods -- coupled with the effects of trade policies -- will affect global economic activity and The second risk is developments in import prices. Reflecting the aforementioned effects of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction, if disruptions in global logistics were to arise or moves to restructure supply chains were to take place and incur considerable costs, import prices could rise, and this could in turn push down domestic demand. In addition, attention continues to be warranted on the risk that prices of grains and other commodities will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Moreover, if import prices were to rise significantly, households' defensive attitudes toward spending could strengthen further, and this could push down the economy. On the other hand, if import prices decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is the impact of various changes in the environment surrounding Japan on firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations and on Japan's potential growth rate. It is expected that factors such as the experience of COVID-19, intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization and on labor market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Intensifying labor shortages -- which are partly due to demographic changes -- could accelerate labor-saving investment, such as for digitalization. On the other hand, if such a substitution of labor with capital does not sufficiently progress, there is a risk that supply-side constraints in some industries will push down the growth rate. Furthermore, the trade policy recently announced in each jurisdiction could trigger a change in the trend of globalization, and depending on the future course of these policies, this change may accelerate. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is firms' wage- and price-setting behavior and its impact on inflation expectations. Firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices, and it is expected in the baseline scenario that this trend will be maintained, despite the deceleration in the economy. However, a prolonged period of high uncertainties regarding trade and other policies in each jurisdiction could lead firms to focus more on cost cutting. As a result, moves to reflect price rises in wages could also weaken. On the other hand, moves to reflect wages in selling prices could strengthen to a greater extent than expected, and upward pressure on wages could intensify with growing expectations that labor market conditions will continue to be tight. In this situation, there is also a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario, accompanied by a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Meanwhile, with regard to the recent rise in food prices, such as rice prices, even when price rises themselves mainly result from weather conditions, attention is warranted on the possibility that these rises may induce second-round effects on underlying CPI inflation through changes in household sentiment The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and import prices, including international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over the outlook for the global economy, including the future course of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction, which could lead to a rise in import prices from the supply side or to this regard, with firms' behavior shifting more toward raising wages and prices recently, exchange rate developments are, compared to the past, more likely to affect prices. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be in the range of 2.0-2.5 percent for fiscal 2027. Meanwhile, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be sluggish, mainly due to the deceleration in the economy. Thereafter, however, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually, since it is projected that a sense of labor shortage will grow as the economic growth rate rises, and that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise. In the second half of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to be at a level that is generally consistent with the price stability target. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There are various risks surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices. In particular, it is extremely uncertain how trade and other policies in each jurisdiction will evolve and how overseas economic activity and prices will react to them. It is therefore necessary to pay due attention to the impact of these developments With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025 and 2026. Risks to prices are also skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025 and Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has generally not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities, although attention continues to be warranted on the pace of increase in real estate prices. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. In addition, even in the case of an adjustment in the real economy at home and abroad and in global financial markets, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. In this regard, given the extremely high uncertainties regarding 5 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" trade and other policies in each jurisdiction, it is necessary to carefully monitor the impact these policies have on the financial system through various channels.6 As for the conduct of monetary policy, given that real interest rates are at significantly low levels, if the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized, the Bank, in accordance with improvement in economic activity and prices, will continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. In this regard, considering the extremely high uncertainties regarding the future course of trade and other policies in each jurisdiction and the impact of these policies, it is important for the Bank to carefully examine factors such as developments in economic activity and will be realized, without any preconceptions. With the price stability target of 2 percent, the Bank will conduct monetary policy as appropriate, in response to developments in Forecasts made in January 2025 Forecasts made in January 2025 Forecasts made in January 2025 Notes: 1.

Risks to prices are skewed to the upside. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 27 and 28, 2022. Japan's economy, despite being affected by factors such as high commodity prices, has picked up as the resumption of economic activity has progressed while public health has been protected from COVID-19. Overseas economies have recovered moderately on the whole, but slowdowns have been observed, mainly in advanced economies. Exports and industrial production have increased as a trend, with the effects of supply-side constraints waning. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has been more or less unchanged. In this situation, business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole. Private consumption has increased moderately, despite being affected by COVID-19. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been at around 3 percent due to rises in prices of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen. Toward the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning and with support from it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from high commodity prices and Slowdowns have been observed in overseas economies, with inflationary pressure exerted on a global basis and central banks thereby continuing to raise policy interest wheat) have turned to a decline on the whole, past rises in these prices have brought about an outflow of income from (i.e., trading losses for) Japan, which relies on imports for most of these commodities, and have put downward pressure on households' real income and corporate profits through rises in energy and food prices. Japan's economy is projected to be under such downward pressure stemming from the slowdowns in overseas economies and the outflow of income, but is likely to recover because a self-sustaining increase in demand, including pent-up demand, is projected to continue with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning. Moreover, the government's various measures are expected to mitigate the negative impact on income. In the household sector, regarding the employment situation, the number of regular is likely to become evident with a recovery in the face-to-face services sector. In addition, wage growth is expected to increase, reflecting improvement in labor market conditions. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing moderately. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be under downward pressure from the real income side due to price rises, it is projected to continue increasing. This is mainly because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions, as the resumption of consumption activities progresses further while public health is being protected. In the corporate sector, although overseas economies, particularly advanced economies, are projected to slow, exports and production are likely to remain on an uptrend with the effects of supply-side constraints waning and with support from high levels of order backlogs for automobiles and capital goods. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is also expected to increase, mainly in reflection of the government's relaxation of entry restrictions. Although high raw material costs are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, albeit with variation across industries and firm sizes. This will likely occur situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear as accommodative financial conditions provide support and supply-side constraints wane. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline gradually in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19. From the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually because the contribution of the materialization of pent-up demand is projected to wane. In the household sector, employee income is likely to continue increasing on the back of a moderate rise in the number of employees associated with improvement in economic activity and of an increase in wage growth that reflects tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Supported by this increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing steadily, although the materialization of pent-up demand is likely to slow. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to increase moderately with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor shortage, digital-related investment, and Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to continue on an improving trend along Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase durable goods. The rate of increase is then expected to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023 because the contribution of such price rises to this CPI is likely to wane. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth. Looking at the projected developments in this CPI by fiscal year, the rate of change is expected to be relatively high at around 3 percent for fiscal 2022 and then be at around 1.5 percent for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. Meanwhile, reflecting price in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is likely to see similar developments to The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. With Japan's economy following a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, the gap is 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. projected to turn positive around the second half of fiscal 2022 and then continue to expand moderately. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify gradually. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen, albeit at a moderate pace relative to short-term ones. The September 2022 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has increased further and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, an increase in actual inflation is expected to bring about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations labor-management wage negotiations, lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, there are extremely high uncertainties, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in Specifically, it is necessary to pay attention to the following upside and downside risks. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Amid ongoing inflationary pressure on a global basis, central banks have raised policy interest rates rapidly, and moves to tighten monetary policy, including a reduction in monetary accommodation, are projected to continue for the time being. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow moderately, albeit at a decelerating pace. That said, vigilance against a wage-price spiral has heightened, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. With central banks continuing to make rapid policy interest rate hikes, there is a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further through adjustments in emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking this risk into account, it is necessary to pay The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the course of this situation, overseas economies, particularly the euro area, could be pushed down further. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined compared with a while ago, they could rise again depending on, for example, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine. Given that Japan is a commodity importer, a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. Such deterioration in the terms of trade squeezes corporate profits and households' real income, and this could lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. On this point, in the baseline scenario, commodity prices are assumed to decline moderately on the whole toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. However, there are surrounding Ukraine -- and global efforts toward addressing climate change. The third factor is how COVID-19 at home and abroad will affect private consumption and firms' export and production activities. COVID-19 resurged in Japan this summer, but its impact on the economy has remained small relative to past phases of COVID-19 surges, and the resumption of consumption activities has progressed steadily while public health has been protected. That said, depending on the course of COVID-19, upward pressure from pent-up demand could weaken by more than expected. On the other hand, if that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions could be withdrawn by more than expected and private consumption could be pushed up. In the meantime, supply-side constraints have remained in part, and if COVID-19 resurges at home and abroad in this situation, such constraints could intensify again through, for example, supply-chain disruptions. If this happens, Japan's exports and production could be pushed down and the adverse impact could even spill over to goods consumption and business fixed The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that efforts with a view to the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization, and decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. In addition, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how households and firms react to these changes, their could go either upward or downward. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. Recently, against the backdrop of high raw material costs, price hikes have been widely observed even among firms that had taken a cautious stance toward changing their selling prices, while their pricing decisions have been made in consideration of price setting by competitors. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through of cost increases could accelerate by more than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, there is a possibility that wages and prices will rise by more than expected as more firms reflect price developments in wage setting through labor-management wage negotiations. On the other hand, given that, in Japan, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily are deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen and prices will deviate The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Fluctuations in international commodity prices have been significant, reflecting high uncertainties over, for example, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, while inflation rates have remained high on a global basis and foreign exchange markets have fluctuated sharply. How these factors will affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. Although it will take time, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually as an underlying trend toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Japan's economy has picked up with the impact of COVID-19 waning, despite being affected by factors such as a rise in commodity prices. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with some weakness seen in part. Exports have continued to increase as a trend, but they have been affected by supply-side constraints, and industrial production has been under strong downward pressure due to the effects of such constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has been more or less unchanged. In this situation, business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole, although some weakness has been seen in part. Private consumption has increased moderately, particularly for services consumption, with the impact of COVID-19 waning. Housing investment has been more or less flat. Public investment has been relatively weak. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been at around 2 percent, mainly due to rises in energy and food prices. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen. Toward the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning and with support from an economic measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming Prices of commodities, such as crude oil, natural gas, coal, and grains (e.g., wheat), have remained high, mainly reflecting heightened supply concerns as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since Japan relies on imports for most of these commodities, rises in these prices bring about an outflow of income from Japan (i.e., trading losses), and put energy and food prices. That said, with the government's various measures mitigating the negative impact on income, a self-sustaining increase in demand, including pent-up demand, is projected to continue on the back of a waning of the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints. For this reason, the economy is likely to recover. In the household sector, employee income is projected to continue increasing moderately on the back of a rise in the number of non-regular employees associated with a recovery in the face-to-face services sector and of an increase in wage growth that reflects improvement in labor market conditions. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be under downward pressure from the real income side due to price rises, it is projected to continue increasing. This is mainly because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, supported by household savings that have accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions, as the resumption of consumption activities progresses while public health is being protected. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to increase, supply-side constraints. This is based on the projection that overseas economies will continue recovering on the whole, despite downward pressure from factors such as the situation surrounding Ukraine. Although raw material cost increases are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, domestic and external demand and partly also of the yen's depreciation. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear as accommodative financial conditions provide support and supply-side constraints wane. Meanwhile, government spending is expected to be more or less flat on the whole. From the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is to decelerate gradually because materialization of pent-up demand is projected to wane. In the household sector, employee income is likely to continue increasing on the back of a moderate rise in the number of employees associated with improvement in economic activity and of an increase in wage growth that reflects tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Supported by this increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing steadily, although the materialization of pent-up demand is likely to slow. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to continue increasing moderately because it is projected that the effects of supply-side constraints, such as on semiconductors, will dissipate, with overseas economies continuing to grow at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to increase. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to keep increasing and downward pressure stemming from raw material cost increases is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor shortage, digital-related investment, and research and development (R&D) investment related to Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to continue on an improving trend along Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase durable goods. Thereafter, the rate of increase is expected to decelerate because the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane. Meanwhile, in terms of inflation excluding energy, for which prices fluctuate significantly, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is expected to increase moderately in positive territory on the back of improvement in the output gap The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. With Japan's economy following a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, the gap is projected to turn positive around the second half of fiscal 2022 and then continue to expand moderately. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify gradually. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen, albeit at a moderate pace relative to short-term ones. The June 2022 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has increased clearly of late and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. Given that the formation of inflation 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, an increase in actual inflation is expected to bring about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations wage negotiations, lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage increases. Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, there are extremely high uncertainties, including the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, and Specifically, it is necessary to pay attention to the following upside and downside risks. The first is how COVID-19 at home and abroad will affect private consumption and firms' export and production activities. If vigilance against COVID-19 persists in Japan, particularly among seniors, there is a risk that upward pressure from pent-up demand will weaken by more than expected and private consumption will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, if vigilance against COVID-19 lessens significantly, household savings that have accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions could be withdrawn by more than expected and private consumption could be pushed up. semiconductor shortage continues, this could lead supply-side constraints to become prolonged and amplified through, for example, supply-chain disruptions. If this happens, Japan's exports and production could be pushed down and the adverse impact could even spill over to goods consumption and business fixed investment. The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the course of this situation, overseas economies, particularly the euro area, could deviate downward from the baseline scenario. In addition, there is a risk that prices of commodities, including grains, will rise or remain high for a prolonged period. Given that Japan is a commodity importer, a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. For this reason, if prices of commodities, including grains, remain high and this results in prolonged deterioration in the terms of trade, wage increases will not catch up with overall price rises and Japan's economy could deviate downward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, if these prices decline significantly, the economy could deviate upward. On this point, in the baseline scenario, commodity prices are assumed to decline are extremely high uncertainties, such as over geopolitical factors -- particularly the situation surrounding Ukraine -- and global efforts toward addressing climate change. The third factor is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Amid a continued rise in inflation, mainly in advanced economies, central banks have accelerated the pace of interest rate hikes, and moves to tighten monetary policy, including a reduction in monetary accommodation, are projected to continue for the time being. While it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates will decline and overseas economies will continue to grow at a moderate pace, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. Under these circumstances, there is a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further through adjustments in asset prices, fluctuations in foreign exchange markets, and capital outflows from emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking this risk into account, it is necessary to pay due The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that efforts with a view to the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization, and decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. In addition, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how households and firms react to these changes, their could go either upward or downward. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. Depending on the degree of upward pass-through of cost increases could accelerate by more than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, given that, in Japan, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily are deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Fluctuations in international commodity prices have been significant, reflecting high uncertainties over, for example, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, while globally elevated inflation rates and sharp fluctuations in foreign exchange markets have been observed. How these factors will affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. Although it will take time, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually as an underlying trend toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, and situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for the time being but are generally balanced thereafter. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Even in the case of an adjustment in the real economy and global financial markets, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Thereafter, it is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually, since downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement, and the effects of such factors as the decline in crude oil prices are likely to dissipate. \uf06c Compared with the previous projections in the July Outlook Report, the projected growth rate is lower for fiscal 2020, mainly due to a delay in recovery in services demand, but is somewhat higher for fiscal 2021 and more or less unchanged for fiscal 2022. The projected rates of increase in the CPI are more or less unchanged. \uf06c The outlook for economic activity and prices provided in this Outlook Report is extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the assumption that COVID-19 will not spread again on such a large scale that the wide-ranging public health measures will need to be reinstated. It also is based on the premises that, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 28 and 29, 2020. Japan's economy has picked up with economic activity resuming, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies also have picked up from a state of significant depression. In this situation, exports and industrial production have increased. On the other hand, business fixed investment has been on a declining trend, against the background of deterioration in corporate profits. With the continuing impact of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has been weak. Private consumption has picked up gradually on the whole, accommodations, has remained at a low level. Housing investment has declined moderately. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Meanwhile, business sentiment deteriorated significantly but subsequently has improved somewhat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but those for corporate financing have remained less so, as seen in weakness in firms' financial positions. On the same hereafter) has been slightly negative, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign. Inflation expectations have weakened somewhat. gradually, is likely to follow an improving trend, supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures. However, the pace of improvement is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID-19 continues. Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth path. This baseline scenario is based on the assumptions that, with progress in efforts to take preventive measures against COVID-19 and improve economic activities simultaneously, COVID-19 will not spread again on such a large scale that the wide-ranging public health measures will need to be reinstated, and that the impact of COVID-19 will almost subside toward the end of the projection period. The outlook also is based on the premises that, in long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Looking at the outlook for economic activity based on the assumptions and premises in more detail, overseas economies are likely to continue improving, partly supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies, but the pace is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID-19 continues. Then, with the impact of COVID-19 almost subsiding, they are likely to continue improving toward the end of the projection period as the production activity of the manufacturing industry is projected to continue recovering globally and face-to-face services consumption in particular is expected to recover Japan's exports of goods are expected to increase for the time being, mainly for automobile-related goods, and then increase for a wide range of goods, including capital goods, with the impact of COVID-19 waning globally. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized as services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry restrictions continue, but is likely to recover thereafter along with a gradual easing in such restrictions. Private consumption is likely to continue picking up, supported also by the government's economic measures, but while vigilance against COVID-19 continues, the pace is expected to be quite moderate, mainly for face-to-face services consumption. Thereafter, with households and firms adapting to a \"new lifestyle\" and the impact of COVID-19 waning, an uptrend in private consumption is likely to become evident gradually, supported also by improvement in employee income. Although the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions are expected to support employment, the employment and income situation is projected to be under downward pressure for the time being against the background of deterioration in corporate profits and worsening labor market conditions. The employment and income situation is likely to turn to an improving trend thereafter, with domestic and external demand recovering. Business fixed investment is expected to remain on a declining trend for the time being, mainly in industries affected strongly by COVID-19. However, with accommodative financial conditions being maintained, it is expected that the capital stock adjustment will not be as significant as that seen at the time of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and that, with the impact of COVID-19 waning, business fixed investment will return to a moderate increasing trend along with improvement in corporate profits. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting the progress in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign.2 With economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of 2 The direct effects of the \"Go To Travel\" campaign on the CPI are estimated to be minus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2020 and 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2021, based on assumptions such as in terms of the period (i.e., from August 2020 through January 2021). COVID-19, it is expected that prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity will be pushed down. The past decline in crude oil prices also is projected to push down the CPI through energy prices. Under these circumstances, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to continue weakening somewhat. Thereafter, downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with prices are likely to dissipate. Under these circumstances, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are expected to rise again. Curve Control.\" It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March in response to COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets.3 In addition, the government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms, through programs that provide loans guaranteed by the credit guarantee corporations and also quasi-capital funds. institutions have actively fulfilled intermediation. In this situation, although firms' financial positions have been weak, the corporate bonds, has remained accommodative. Regarding financial markets, tension has eased, although they are still nervous. Owing to the Bank's and the government's measures, as well as efforts made by private financial institutions together with those measures, the Bank considers that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay 4 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are their impact on domestic and overseas economies. Until effective medicines and vaccines are developed, it is highly unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve and how long it will take for the impact to subside. In particular, if the wide-ranging public health measures are reinstated, economic activity is likely to be constrained significantly again. In addition, while vigilance against COVID-19 continues, households' and firms' behavior at home and abroad is uncertain, with people voluntarily making precautionary efforts. The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the impact of COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if the issue of COVID-19 leads to, for example, active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection and an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, thereby having positive The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although COVID-19 has affected the financial side as well, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively, with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation has been ensured.5 However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be Risks that are specific to prices are as follows. The first is uncertainties over firms' of economic activity. A decrease in demand due to constrained economic activity is likely to put downward pressure on prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity. On the other hand, since one of the reasons for the current decrease is vigilance against COVID-19, price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been observed widely to date. In addition, economic activity has been constrained also from the supply side, such as by limiting the number of customers to prevent infection. Under these circumstances, there are high uncertainties over how firms will set their prices and how this will affect general prices from a macro perspective. The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario, and thus continue to warrant attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. For the time being, downward pressure is expected to be put on prices with economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, and medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to weaken somewhat. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase gradually since downward pressure on them is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement. In addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the assumption that COVID-19 will not spread again on such a large scale that the wide-ranging public health measures will need to be reinstated. It also is based on the long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings 6 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024, due to factors such as the effects, albeit waning, of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices and a waning of the effects of the government's economic measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. As for fiscal 2025, the rate of increase is projected to decelerate owing to dissipation of these factors. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise. The likelihood of realizing this outlook has continued to gradually rise, although there remain high uncertainties over future developments. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rate is somewhat lower for fiscal 2023 and somewhat higher for fiscal 2024. The projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 is lower, mainly due to the effects of the recent decline in crude oil prices. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are generally balanced. In terms of prices, it should be noted that, mainly due to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in society. Considering this, it is important to closely monitor whether a virtuous cycle between wages and prices will intensify. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 22 and 23, 2024. Japan's economy has recovered moderately. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat. Corporate profits and business sentiment have improved. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has continued to increase moderately, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative. increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been relatively large, partly due to the government's economic measures. That said, the rate of increase in the CPI has been in the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have remained, and services prices have increased moderately. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately for the time being, supported financial conditions and the government's economic measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a slowdown in the pace of recovery in measures are projected to wane, but Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2023 is somewhat lower, mainly reflecting the actual data showing that the rate of change in business fixed investment has been lower than was previously projected. The projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased employee income is projected to continue increasing. Against this backdrop, although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to keep increasing moderately for the time being. This is because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of sentiment, which mainly reflects the rise in wage growth, are expected to provide support. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned by the government's measures, such as (1) those to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity in income tax and inhabitant tax. Thereafter, although private consumption is likely to be affected by a slowdown in the materialization of pent-up demand and a waning of the positive contribution of the government's various measures, it is expected to keep increasing moderately, supported by the rise in employee income. In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be more or less flat for the time being, affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies. Subsequently, they are likely to return to an uptrend, mainly due to moderate growth in global demand for IT-related goods. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to keep improving, as it is projected that they will be pushed up for the time being by factors such as progress in the pass-through of past high raw material costs to selling prices, and thereafter by a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19, and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with the The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024, due to factors such as the effects, albeit waning, of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices and a waning of the effects of the government's economic measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. As for fiscal 2025, the rate of increase is projected to decelerate owing to dissipation of these factors. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to long-term Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 is lower, mainly due to the effects of the recent decline in crude oil prices. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges are expected to 2023. For fiscal 2024 and 2025, on the other hand, they are projected to push up the rates due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of each 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. previous year.4 In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to decelerate, due to a gradual waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices, and subsequently be at around 2 percent toward the end of the projection period. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to widen gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. The December 2023 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices is lower than a while ago but has remained at a high level, and that figures for firms' inflation outlook for general prices have declined somewhat for the short term but have remained at high levels for the medium to long term. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. In this situation, firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices. Regarding the outlook, inflation expectations are expected to rise labor-management wage negotiations. Under these circumstances, a virtuous cycle between wages and prices is projected to intensify through achievement of wage increases that reflect price rises and through a pass-through of wage increases to selling Considering the above assessments, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target. Taking account, for example, of management toward wage negotiations, the likelihood of realizing this outlook has 4 The Comprehensive Economic Measures to Completely Break Free from Deflation were decided by the Cabinet in November 2023. As part of these measures, the government decided to continue with measures to reduce the burden of higher gasoline prices through April 2024. It also decided that measures to reduce the burden of higher electricity and gas charges will remain effective for charges on these types of energy consumed through May 2024. Assuming that these measures to reduce those various burdens will not be extended and will be phased out, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food), mainly for fiscal 2024, will be pushed up by a waning of the effects of these measures pushing down CPI inflation of each previous year. continued to gradually rise, although there remain high uncertainties over future Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis, inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to conduct tight monetary policy, but some have apparently signaled future policy interest rate reductions. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow moderately, albeit with variation across countries and regions. There is also a possibility that, if inflationary pressure wanes further, moves to reduce policy interest rates will strengthen and affect these economies. On the other hand, there is a risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, since the policy interest rate hikes by overseas central banks to date have been rapid, there are high uncertainties over how these hikes will affect their real economies and financial systems with a time lag. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial Meanwhile, depending on the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine, downward pressure on overseas economies, particularly the euro area, could heighten. In addition, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets. The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, including grains. While prices of grains and other commodities had declined on the whole -- albeit with fluctuations -- after reaching their peak around the middle of 2022, attention continues to be warranted on the risk that these prices will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. If the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario increases were to be limited, this could further strengthen households' defensive attitudes toward spending and push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these changes, their medium- to long-term growth expectations, the potential growth rate, and the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, with Japan's economy following a recovery trend and against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by consumer prices have been gradually waning, this pass-through could continue for longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario, depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario to a greater extent than can be explained by changes in the output gap, as moves to reflect become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with inflation decelerating, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could decline through the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation, and this could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although the wage growth rate agreed in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations last year was significantly higher than in the previous year, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected and prices will deviate downward from the baseline The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024 and then decelerate in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise. The likelihood of realizing this outlook has continued to gradually rise, although there remain high uncertainties over future developments. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There are extremely high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are generally balanced. In terms of prices, it should be noted that, mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in society. Considering this, it is important to closely monitor whether a virtuous cycle between wages and prices will intensify. 5 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the global financial markets, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain the stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in October 2023 Forecasts made in October 2023 Forecasts made in October 2023 Notes: 1.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023, with a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately, albeit with fluctuations, as the output gap improves and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as firms' price- and wage-setting behavior. \uf06c Comparing the projections through fiscal 2024 with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rates for fiscal 2022 and 2023 are lower, mainly due to a lower projection for private consumption, but the projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is more or less unchanged. The projected year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2023 and 2024 are somewhat higher, mainly due to a higher projection for wages. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices as well as developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on April 27 and 28, 2023. Japan's economy has picked up, despite being affected by factors such as past high commodity prices. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has been more or less unchanged. In this situation, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole. Private consumption has increased moderately, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some fresh food) is slower than a while ago, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures, but it has been at around 3 percent recently owing to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently after rising. Toward around the middle of fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is likely to recover moderately, supported by the materialization of pent-up demand, as well as by factors such as it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from past high commodity prices In the household sector, regarding the employment situation, the number of both regular and non-regular employees is likely to rise on the back of improvement in economic activity. In addition, wage growth is expected to increase, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Due to these factors, employee income is projected to continue increasing. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be affected by price rises, it is projected to continue increasing moderately. This is mainly because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions. Private consumption is also likely to be underpinned by the government's measures such as those to reduce the In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies resulting mainly from the impact they are likely to be more or less flat due to factors such as a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Although past high raw material costs are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at continued improvement in economic activity. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support and the effects of supply-side constraints wane, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor investment associated with strengthening supply chains. From the second half of fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at gradually intensifies in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate gradually toward the end of the projection period due to a waning of the In the household sector, employment is projected to continue increasing, but the pace of increase is likely to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an recovery. In this situation, wage growth is expected to increase as a trend, partly reflecting price rises, and employee income is projected to continue increasing. Supported by the increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing, although the pace of increase is likely to decelerate as the materialization of pent-up demand slows and the positive contribution of the government's various measures wanes. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to return to an uptrend with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to increase and downward pressure stemming from high raw material costs is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is projected to continue increasing. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase steadily. Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat throughout the projection period, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19 and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with an The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) had been increasing led by the rise in import prices. However, the rate of increase has decelerated recently, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures. Since international commodity prices are lower than a while ago and the year-on-year rate of increase in the import price index has decelerated, it is projected that there will be a waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the rise in import prices. For this reason, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is highly likely to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Thereafter, it is projected to accelerate again moderately, albeit with 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as firms' The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges are expected to for the first half of fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024, on the other hand, they are likely to push up the rate due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of change is projected to be at around 2.5 percent for fiscal 2023 and then be in the range of The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to turn positive around the middle of fiscal 2023 and expand moderately toward the end of the projection period, albeit at a gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged recently after rising moderately. The March 2023 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has been at a high level, and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has also been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. With regard to the annual compiled by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo) show that the wage growth rate agreed in the negotiations thus far has been significantly higher than in the previous year, including base pay. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Regarding the outlook, even as actual inflation decelerates toward the middle of fiscal 2023, inflation expectations are likely to rise again moderately toward the end of the projection period, behavior and in labor-management wage negotiations. This will likely lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage increases. Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago, inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to raise their policy interest rates. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow, albeit at a moderate pace. That said, vigilance against the risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases has remained high, mainly in advanced economies. In this situation, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. In addition, there was a phase when market participants' risk sentiment deteriorated, mainly due to the effects of issues surrounding some financial institutions in the United States and Europe. With central banks continuing to make policy interest rate hikes, there is also a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further, mainly through adjustments in asset prices, fluctuations in outflows from emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign regarding China, where the resumption of economic activity has progressed rapidly, there are high uncertainties over the pace of materialization of pent-up demand in terms of both The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the area, could heighten. In addition, although prices of commodities, including grains, have declined on the whole after reaching their peak around the middle of last year, there are extremely high uncertainties regarding the outlook, such as over geopolitical factors -- particularly the situation surrounding Ukraine -- and the effects of efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase households' real income, and this could lead business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario through more cautious spending behavior of firms and households. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, see a clearer downtrend, the economy could deviate upward. The third factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying labor shortages, and progress on efforts with a view to decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by competitors. Depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop, the pass-through to consumer prices could continue longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario as moves to reflect not only price developments in wage setting but also wage developments in price setting become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with prices of commodities, including grains, declining on the whole, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could decline through the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation and this could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although a wage growth rate that is significantly higher than in the previous year is likely to be achieved as a result of this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected from next year and prices will deviate The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been above 2 percent. The rate of increase, however, is expected to decelerate to a level below 2 percent toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Although it will take time, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices as well as developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2023 but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2023 but are skewed to the downside for fiscal 2025. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, including the effects of the recent issues surrounding some financial institutions in the United States and Europe, the financial system is likely to remain highly 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments.5 As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in January 2023 Forecasts made in January 2023 Forecasts made in January 2023 Notes: 1.

Business sentiment has been more or less unchanged on it has deteriorated manufacturing industry but has continued to improve in the nonmanufacturing industry. In this fixed investment has increased moderately. The business fixed investment for fiscal 2022 is expected to be 2023 -- which was surveyed for the first time in this Tankan -- is firmly positive. In the household sector, the employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole, and an income has gradually become clear. In this situation, private has moderately, despite being affected by price rises. In sum, although Japan's economy has been affected by factors such as the slowdown in the income to spending has been operating in both Japan's economy is likely to recover moderately supported by government's economic measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from past high commodity prices and fading and overseas economies picking up, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing intensifies in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is highly likely to decelerate economic measures. Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook and 2023 are lower. This mainly reflects the fact demand has moderated for private consumption. The lower projections also reflect, for example, 7 The government formulated the Comprehensive Emergency Measures to Counter Soaring Crude Oil and Other Prices under the COVID-19 Pandemic in April 2022, the Comprehensive Economic Measures Increases and Revitalizing the Economy in October 2022, and additional measures toward overcoming price increases in March 2023. The implementation of the budget based on these measures is expected to mainly push up government consumption and private consumption, and thereby support economic activity. exports being pushed down by factors such as a The projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is more The potential growth rate seems to have been in This is because, although the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP) has increased slightly, working hours have continued on a downtrend, reflecting working-style reforms, and growth in capital stock has decelerated as a result of past declines in business fixed investment. As for the outlook, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately. This is based on the projection that, although there will be less room for the number of employed persons to increase, (1) the TFP growth rate will increase moderately, mainly resulting improvement in efficiency of resource in human capital, (2) the decline in working hours will come to a halt in reflection of the diminishing capital stock will accelerate.

It is also possible that will have a significant gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In fiscal 2023, Japan's economy is likely recover moderately, supported by of recovery in overseas economies is expected to Although goods exports are projected to be affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies, they are likely to be more goods exports are likely to return to an uptrend with overseas economies picking up. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is projected to keep increasing fixed investment is also expected to continue increasing, with corporate profits being at high demand for investment that had been postponed during the pandemic. In the household sector, nominal employee income is likely to continue rising. This is because the number of both regular and non-regular employees is projected to rise on wage growth is expected to increase, reflecting tightening labor market conditions and price rises. income stemming is projected to ease on the back of a waning of the cost increases led by a rise in import prices, as well as the continued effects of pushing down measures. In this situation, private consumption is expected to keep increasing moderately. This is mainly because it is projected that pent-up demand will continue to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions. Government spending is expected to decline, reflecting a reduction in expenditure related to COVID-19, although it is likely to be supported by progress in construction related to building national resilience and by an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. government's economic measures are likely to wane, Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, with overseas economies picking up and being maintained. Goods exports are likely to increase economies. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is also expected to continue increasing, including digital-related investment, investment related to investment associated with strengthening supply employee income is likely to continue increasing steadily. This is because wage growth is expected to remain relatively high, although it will gradually become more difficult for labor supply to increase, seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. In this situation, private consumption is likely to continue increasing moderately, although it is projected that a waning of the effects of the government's economic measures pushing down prices of the previous year will push down real demand will wane. Government spending is expected to turn to a moderate increase on the in construction related building national resilience and an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. demand is expected to continue increasing, the growth pace of Japan's economy is likely to slow demand. Goods exports are likely to increase moderately, with overseas economies continuing to grow. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is also expected to continue increasing, mainly for to address decarbonization; however, the pace of increase is projected to slow somewhat, partly because it is likely to be pushed down by adjustment pressure on capital stock. Although pent-up demand is to peak out, private consumption is projected to continue increasing moderately, with income situation continuing improve, supported by wage is expected to keep increasing healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Public investment has been more or less flat (Chart 4). With progress in construction based on the government's economic measures, including construction related to building national resilience, the amount of public construction completed -- a coincident indicator of public investment -- has continued to be more or less flat from a somewhat long-term perspective, but has increased recently, fluctuations stemming large-scale projects.

As for the outlook, public investment is likely to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to continuing. Government consumption is projected to see a in expenditure related to COVID-19, such as regarding vaccination. Thereafter, however, government consumption is likely to return to an increasing reflecting an uptrend healthcare and nursing care expenditures. 8 The five-year acceleration measures for building national resilience with a project size of about 15 trillion yen were decided by the Cabinet in December 2020. In these measures, public investment projects for disaster prevention, disaster mitigation, and building national resilience are to be implemented intensively over five years from fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2025. The government's economic measures decided by the Cabinet in October 2022 also include efforts to implement the acceleration measures. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed (Chart 5). By region, the U.S. economy has remained on a slowing trend, in reflection of although firmness has been seen in private consumption. European economies have slowed easing, as they have continued to be affected by the situation surrounding Ukraine. The Chinese economy has picked up despite continued toward normalization of economic activity have been seen with the impact of COVID-19 waning.

In particular, close attention needs to be paid to whether moves to reflect price rises in wages, as observed continue. Labor shortages have been acute recently and are highly likely to become more labor market mobility has been gradually increasing, as seen in the growth in the labor market for job changers. These changes in the labor market may make moves to reflect price push forward with efforts to recruit and retain It is also necessary to examine whether the effects of wages on prices, which have started to be seen recently, will spread. Services prices are key in this regard. The rate of change in services prices has remained at around 0 percent since the end of the 1990s because such prices have become stickier, as evidenced by the significant 21 For details on the current situation of and outlook for labor market conditions, see Box 2 in the January 2023 Outlook Report. 10123492970207121722 Actual base pay increaseChart B2-3:Estimation of Base Pay IncreasesSources: Central Labour RelationsCommission; Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo); Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, etc.Notes:1.

Given labor shortages are expected to continue, firms have been moving replace Labor-saving investment was already following an retailing industry, where labor shortages have been acute, firms' efforts to address this issue through the use of digital technology have been accelerating (Chart B3-1). Moreover, analyzing microdata from the Tankan surveys suggests the following. First, firms facing more acute labor shortages have been more active in making business fixed investment (Chart B3-2). Second, among such firms, the longer they have faced labor shortages, the more active they have tended to be in making such investment (Chart Accommodations,eating & drinking servicesSource: Bank of Japan.Note: Based on the Tankan. All enterprises. The figures for fiscal 2022 and 2023 are forecasts from the March 2023 survey.Chart B3-1:Software Investment 20-15-10-5051015202530141516171819202122 FYy/y % chg. B3-3). Given these factors, since labor market conditions are highly likely to remain tight going forward, it can be said that there is large potential demand for labor-saving investment to address labor shortages, which is projected to underpin business fixed investment. That said, it should be noted that there are such potential demand will materialize. The following points should also be kept in mind regarding future developments in business fixed The first is whether labor-saving investment will be hampered by factors such as a lack of highly skilled personnel. Estimating the elasticity of for example, wage increases lead to substitution between the two -- shows that the elasticity has increased since the mid-2010s (Chart B3-4). This suggests that, with labor shortages intensifying, firms' efforts to make up for such shortages with capital have started to accelerate. That said, the elasticity estimates for Japan are lower than those for the United States obtained in preceding there are various possible explanations, one likely reason is a lack of highly develop and use labor-saving software. In fact, the Tankan shows that firms' actual software investment recently has been falling far short of their plans as a trend, suggesting the possibility that firms have been unable to make as much progress with digitalization as they had planned 24 See, for example, Knoblach, M., Roessler, M., and Zwerschke, P., \"The Elasticity of Substitution between Capital and Labour in the US Economy: A Meta-Regression Analysis,\" Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 82, no. 1 (2020): 62-82. The study examines the estimates of the elasticity of substitution between labor and capital in the United States obtained in preceding studies. The median of the estimates is around 0.7, but it should be noted that, since estimates differ across studies, such comparisons need to be interpreted with considerable latitude. sensitivity<Labor shortages> [Number of quarters firms reported labor shortages during the preceding 8-quarter period]1-2 quarters3-4 quarters5-8 quartersTemporarySomewhat prolongedProlonged \u200b******0.00.20.40.60.81.0TemporarySomewhatprolongedProlongedSource: Bank of Japan.Note: The results are based on panel estimation using microdata from the Tankan.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to increase toward the end of this year due to rises in prices of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. Thereafter, the rate of increase is expected to decelerate because the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane. Meanwhile, in terms of inflation excluding energy, for which prices fluctuate significantly, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is expected to increase moderately in positive territory on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected growth rate for fiscal 2022 is lower due to the effects of such factors as a slowdown in overseas economies and intensification of supply-side constraints. However, the projected growth rates thereafter are somewhat higher, partly owing to a rebound from the lower projection for fiscal 2022. The projected rates of increase in the CPI are higher, mainly for the near term, reflecting the impact of a rise in import prices and of a pass-through of that rise to consumer prices. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, and developments in commodity prices and in overseas economic activity and prices. In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for the time being but are generally balanced thereafter. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on July 20 and 21, 2022. Japan's economy has picked up with the impact of COVID-19 waning, despite being affected by factors such as a rise in commodity prices. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with some weakness seen in part. Exports have continued to increase as a trend, but they have been affected by supply-side constraints, and industrial production has been under strong downward pressure due to the effects of such constraints. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole, and business sentiment has been more or less unchanged. In this situation, business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole, although some weakness has been seen in part. Private consumption has increased moderately, particularly for services consumption, with the impact of COVID-19 waning. Housing investment has been more or less flat. Public investment has been relatively weak. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been at around 2 percent, mainly due to rises in energy and food prices. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen. Toward the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning and with support from an economic measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming Prices of commodities, such as crude oil, natural gas, coal, and grains (e.g., wheat), have remained high, mainly reflecting heightened supply concerns as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since Japan relies on imports for most of these commodities, rises in these prices bring about an outflow of income from Japan (i.e., trading losses), and put energy and food prices. That said, with the government's various measures mitigating the negative impact on income, a self-sustaining increase in demand, including pent-up demand, is projected to continue on the back of a waning of the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints. For this reason, the economy is likely to recover. In the household sector, employee income is projected to continue increasing moderately on the back of a rise in the number of non-regular employees associated with a recovery in the face-to-face services sector and of an increase in wage growth that reflects improvement in labor market conditions. In this situation, although private consumption is expected to be under downward pressure from the real income side due to price rises, it is projected to continue increasing. This is mainly because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, supported by household savings that have accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions, as the resumption of consumption activities progresses while public health is being protected. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to increase, supply-side constraints. This is based on the projection that overseas economies will continue recovering on the whole, despite downward pressure from factors such as the situation surrounding Ukraine. Although raw material cost increases are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to remain at high levels on the whole, domestic and external demand and partly also of the yen's depreciation. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear as accommodative financial conditions provide support and supply-side constraints wane. Meanwhile, government spending is expected to be more or less flat on the whole. From the middle of the projection period, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually in the overall economy. That said, the pace of growth is to decelerate gradually because materialization of pent-up demand is projected to wane. In the household sector, employee income is likely to continue increasing on the back of a moderate rise in the number of employees associated with improvement in economic activity and of an increase in wage growth that reflects tightening labor market conditions and price rises. Supported by this increase in employee income, private consumption is expected to keep increasing steadily, although the materialization of pent-up demand is likely to slow. In the corporate sector, exports and production are likely to continue increasing moderately because it is projected that the effects of supply-side constraints, such as on semiconductors, will dissipate, with overseas economies continuing to grow at a moderate pace. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to increase. Corporate profits are likely to follow an improving trend since domestic and external demand is expected to keep increasing and downward pressure stemming from raw material cost increases is likely to wane gradually. In this situation, with support from accommodative financial conditions, business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor shortage, digital-related investment, and research and development (R&D) investment related to Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to continue on an improving trend along Meanwhile, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase durable goods. Thereafter, the rate of increase is expected to decelerate because the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane. Meanwhile, in terms of inflation excluding energy, for which prices fluctuate significantly, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is expected to increase moderately in positive territory on the back of improvement in the output gap The main factors that determine inflation rates are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been slightly negative. With Japan's economy following a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, the gap is projected to turn positive around the second half of fiscal 2022 and then continue to expand moderately. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify gradually. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen, albeit at a moderate pace relative to short-term ones. The June 2022 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices has increased clearly of late and firms' inflation outlook for general prices has been at a high level, not only for the short term but also for the medium to long term. Given that the formation of inflation 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, an increase in actual inflation is expected to bring about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations wage negotiations, lead to a sustained rise in prices accompanied by wage increases. Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, there are extremely high uncertainties, including the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, and Specifically, it is necessary to pay attention to the following upside and downside risks. The first is how COVID-19 at home and abroad will affect private consumption and firms' export and production activities. If vigilance against COVID-19 persists in Japan, particularly among seniors, there is a risk that upward pressure from pent-up demand will weaken by more than expected and private consumption will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, if vigilance against COVID-19 lessens significantly, household savings that have accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions could be withdrawn by more than expected and private consumption could be pushed up. semiconductor shortage continues, this could lead supply-side constraints to become prolonged and amplified through, for example, supply-chain disruptions. If this happens, Japan's exports and production could be pushed down and the adverse impact could even spill over to goods consumption and business fixed investment. The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and the associated developments in prices of commodities, including grains. Depending on the course of this situation, overseas economies, particularly the euro area, could deviate downward from the baseline scenario. In addition, there is a risk that prices of commodities, including grains, will rise or remain high for a prolonged period. Given that Japan is a commodity importer, a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. For this reason, if prices of commodities, including grains, remain high and this results in prolonged deterioration in the terms of trade, wage increases will not catch up with overall price rises and Japan's economy could deviate downward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, if these prices decline significantly, the economy could deviate upward. On this point, in the baseline scenario, commodity prices are assumed to decline are extremely high uncertainties, such as over geopolitical factors -- particularly the situation surrounding Ukraine -- and global efforts toward addressing climate change. The third factor is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Amid a continued rise in inflation, mainly in advanced economies, central banks have accelerated the pace of interest rate hikes, and moves to tighten monetary policy, including a reduction in monetary accommodation, are projected to continue for the time being. While it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates will decline and overseas economies will continue to grow at a moderate pace, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. Under these circumstances, there is a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further through adjustments in asset prices, fluctuations in foreign exchange markets, and capital outflows from emerging economies, and that this will eventually lead to overseas economies deviating downward from the baseline scenario. Taking this risk into account, it is necessary to pay due The fourth factor considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that efforts with a view to the post-COVID-19 era, digitalization, and decarbonization will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. In addition, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how households and firms react to these changes, their could go either upward or downward. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' price- and wage-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. Depending on the degree of upward pass-through of cost increases could accelerate by more than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario. On the other hand, given that, in Japan, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that prices and wages will not increase easily are deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen and prices will deviate downward from the baseline scenario. The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. Fluctuations in international commodity prices have been significant, reflecting high uncertainties over, for example, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, while globally elevated inflation rates and sharp fluctuations in foreign exchange markets have been observed. How these factors will affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. Although it will take time, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually as an underlying trend toward achieving the price stability target, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, and situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign to the risk balance, risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being but are generally balanced thereafter. Risks to prices are skewed to the upside for the time being but are generally balanced thereafter. On the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Even in the case of an adjustment in the real economy and global financial markets, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the whole, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, such as from low interest rates, the declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under 4 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

For fiscal 2023, the growth is projected to remain relatively high, supported by an increase in external demand and accommodative financial conditions, although it is likely to decelerate somewhat, mainly due to economy is likely to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous fiscal 2022 is lower due to the effects of such are somewhat higher, partly owing to a rebound The potential growth rate seems to have been in This is because, although the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP) has increased slightly, working hours have continued on a downtrend, reflecting working-style reforms, and growth in capital stock has decelerated as a result of past declines in business fixed investment. As for the outlook, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately. This is based on the projection decline in working hours will slow with the effects of working-style reforms diminishing, and (3) growth in capital stock will accelerate cyclically. These developments are likely to be encouraged terms of labor, it is highly uncertain what kind of working style, including working from home, will take hold as the resumption of economic activity progresses while public health is being protected. In addition, in the corporate sector, there remain aim at adapting to the post-pandemic economic and industrial structures, including efforts toward digitalization and addressing climate change. the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some latitude. Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In fiscal 2022, Japan's economy is likely to recover. This is because, although domestic demand, such as business fixed investment and private consumption, is expected to be under downward pressure stemming terms of trade, it is projected that the impact of COVID-19 on services consumption will wane intensified again reflecting lockdowns such as in Shanghai, will ease gradually. Another reason is government's economic measures are likely to provide support. Specifically, goods exports, in the short run, are expected to continue to be affected by, for example, disruptions in distribution networks due to lockdowns such as in Shanghai. Thereafter, however, they are likely to increase since it is projected that overseas economies will continue recovering on the whole and that the effects of supply-side constraints will wane gradually. Private consumption is expected to be pushed down by deterioration in real income due employment situation, it is projected to continue increasing because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, supported by household savings that have accumulated as a result of pandemic-related activities progresses while public health is being protected. An uptrend fixed investment is expected to become clear. This is based on the projection that corporate profits will the effects of supply-side constraints will wane rise. Overall government spending is projected to be more or less flat because expenditure related to COVID-19 is expected to continue and public investment is projected to level off. economy is projected to remain relatively high, supported by an increase in external demand and is likely to decelerate somewhat, mainly due to economic measures. Japan's goods exports are projected to continue increasing as overseas economies keep growing moderately and as the demand, which is categorized under services exports, is projected to increase. Business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, including investment to address labor shortage, for growth areas and to address environmental issues. Private consumption is expected to keep increasing. This is based on the projection that employee income will continue improving and pent-up demand will continue to materialize, construction related to building national resilience expenditures are to provide support, government spending is expected to decline, reflecting a reduction in expenditure related to growth is likely to decelerate, mainly due to the waning of pent-up demand, Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at a pace above its continuing financial conditions being maintained. Goods exports are to continue increasing moderately. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is expected to continue increasing, although it is likely to see deceleration in the pace of increase due to adjustment pressure stemming from the demand is likely to wane, private consumption is projected to continue increasing moderately as continues Government spending is expected to turn to a construction related to building national resilience Public investment has been relatively weak (Chart 4).

Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth path. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign. Thereafter, it is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually, since downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement, and the effects of such factors as the decline in crude oil prices are likely to dissipate. \uf06c Compared with the previous projections in the July Outlook Report, the projected growth rate is lower for fiscal 2020, mainly due to a delay in recovery in services demand, but is somewhat higher for fiscal 2021 and more or less unchanged for fiscal 2022. The projected rates of increase in the CPI are more or less unchanged. \uf06c The outlook for economic activity and prices provided in this Outlook Report is extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the assumption that COVID-19 will not spread again on such a large scale that the wide-ranging public health measures will need to be reinstated. It also is based on the premises that, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on October 28 and 29, 2020. Japan's economy has picked up with economic activity resuming, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies also have picked up from a state of significant depression. In this situation, exports and industrial production have increased. On the other hand, business fixed investment has been on a declining trend, against the background of deterioration in corporate profits. With the continuing impact of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has been weak. Private consumption has picked up gradually on the whole, accommodations, has remained at a low level. Housing investment has declined moderately. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Meanwhile, business sentiment deteriorated significantly but subsequently has improved somewhat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but those for corporate financing have remained less so, as seen in weakness in firms' financial positions. On the same hereafter) has been slightly negative, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign. Inflation expectations have weakened somewhat. gradually, is likely to follow an improving trend, supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures. However, the pace of improvement is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID-19 continues. Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth path. This baseline scenario is based on the assumptions that, with progress in efforts to take preventive measures against COVID-19 and improve economic activities simultaneously, COVID-19 will not spread again on such a large scale that the wide-ranging public health measures will need to be reinstated, and that the impact of COVID-19 will almost subside toward the end of the projection period. The outlook also is based on the premises that, in long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Looking at the outlook for economic activity based on the assumptions and premises in more detail, overseas economies are likely to continue improving, partly supported by vigilance against COVID-19 continues. Then, with the impact of COVID-19 almost subsiding, they are likely to continue improving toward the end of the projection period as the production activity of the manufacturing industry is projected to continue recovering globally and face-to-face services consumption in particular is expected to recover Japan's exports of goods are expected to increase for the time being, mainly for automobile-related goods, and then increase for a wide range of goods, including capital goods, with the impact of COVID-19 waning globally. Inbound tourism consumption, which is categorized as services exports, is expected to remain subdued while entry restrictions continue, but is likely to recover thereafter along with a gradual easing in such restrictions. Private consumption is likely to continue picking up, supported also by the government's economic measures, but while vigilance against COVID-19 continues, the pace is expected to be quite moderate, mainly for face-to-face services consumption. Thereafter, with households and firms adapting to a \"new lifestyle\" and the impact of COVID-19 waning, an uptrend in private consumption is likely to become evident gradually, supported also by improvement in employee income. Although the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions are expected to support employment, the employment and income situation is projected to be under downward pressure for the time being against the background of deterioration in corporate profits and worsening labor market conditions. The employment and income situation is likely to turn to an improving trend thereafter, with domestic and external demand recovering. Business fixed investment is expected to remain on a declining trend for the time being, mainly in industries affected strongly by COVID-19. However, with accommodative financial conditions being maintained, it is expected that the capital stock adjustment will not be as significant as that seen at the time of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and that, with the impact of COVID-19 waning, business fixed investment will return to a moderate increasing trend along with improvement in corporate profits. Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting the progress in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience. Thereafter, it is expected to be at a relatively high level. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign.2 With economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of 2 The direct effects of the \"Go To Travel\" campaign on the CPI are estimated to be minus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2020 and 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2021, based on assumptions such as in terms of the period (i.e., from August 2020 through January 2021). COVID-19, it is expected that prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity will be pushed down. The past decline in crude oil prices also is projected to push down the CPI through energy prices. Under these circumstances, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to continue weakening somewhat. Thereafter, downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with prices are likely to dissipate. Under these circumstances, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are expected to rise again. Curve Control.\" It also has conducted various powerful monetary easing measures since March in response to COVID-19 with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets.3 In addition, the government has conducted various measures to support financing, mainly of firms, through programs that provide loans guaranteed by the credit guarantee corporations and also quasi-capital funds. institutions have actively fulfilled intermediation. In this situation, although firms' financial positions have been weak, the corporate bonds, has remained accommodative. Regarding financial markets, tension has eased, although they are still nervous. Owing to the Bank's and the government's measures, as well as efforts made by private financial institutions together with those measures, the Bank considers that financial conditions will remain accommodative and further downward pressure on the real economy from the financial side will be avoided.4 Regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, it is necessary to pay 4 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. The first is the impact of COVID-19 on domestic and overseas economies. There are their impact on domestic and overseas economies. Until effective medicines and vaccines are developed, it is highly unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve and how long it will take for the impact to subside. In particular, if the wide-ranging public health measures are reinstated, economic activity is likely to be constrained significantly again. In addition, while vigilance against COVID-19 continues, households' and firms' behavior at home and abroad is uncertain, with people voluntarily making precautionary efforts. The second risk is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. If such expectations decline due to a shock caused by COVID-19 that pushes down the economy considerably, there is a risk that firms' and households' appetite for spending will not increase easily even after the impact of COVID-19 subsides. On the other hand, medium- to long-term growth expectations could increase if the issue of COVID-19 leads to, for example, active use of information and communication technology to prevent infection and an undertaking of investment to meet new demand, thereby having positive The third risk is developments in the financial system. Although COVID-19 has affected the financial side as well, the Bank and the government have taken measures aggressively, with a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. In addition, financial institutions have considerable resilience in terms of both capital and liquidity. In this situation, the financial system has maintained stability on the whole and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation has been ensured.5 However, if COVID-19 has a larger impact than expected, there is a risk that deterioration in the real economy will affect financial system stability, thereby exerting further downward pressure on the real economy. Although this risk is judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be Risks that are specific to prices are as follows. The first is uncertainties over firms' of economic activity. A decrease in demand due to constrained economic activity is likely to put downward pressure on prices of goods and services that are sensitive to economic activity. On the other hand, since one of the reasons for the current decrease is vigilance against COVID-19, price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been observed widely to date. In addition, economic activity has been constrained also from the supply side, such as by limiting the number of customers to prevent infection. Under these circumstances, there are high uncertainties over how firms will set their prices and how this will affect general prices from a macro perspective. The second is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. These risks may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario, and thus continue to warrant attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario for the outlook. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, although it will take time. For the time being, downward pressure is expected to be put on prices with economic activity remaining at a low level due to the impact of COVID-19, and medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to weaken somewhat. Thereafter, prices are expected to increase gradually since downward pressure on them is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement. In addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations also are likely to rise again. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. The outlook for economic activity and prices is extremely unclear, since it could change depending on the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. The outlook is based on the assumption that COVID-19 will not spread again on such a large scale that the wide-ranging public health measures will need to be reinstated. It also is based on the long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. However, the assumption and premises entail high uncertainties. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation, given the existing factors -- such as the prolonged low interest rate environment, the declining population, and excess savings 6 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" in the corporate sector -- as well as the recent impact of COVID-19. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will continue with \"QQE with Yield Curve Control,\" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary The Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Meanwhile, public investment is projected to steadily increase, reflecting progress such as in construction related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national resilience.

However, the economy is likely to mark impact of COVID-19 is expected to wane, and then continue to grow firmly for fiscal 2022, mainly economies. Compared with projected growth rate is lower for fiscal 2020, demand, but is somewhat higher for fiscal 2021 The potential growth rate seems to have declined to around 0 percent recently (Chart 3). This is largely because total factor productivity (TFP) has declined, mainly due to preventive measures working hours have been on a downtrend due to hours. For the time being, although the downtrend in working hours is likely to slow its pace, the potential growth rate is expected to remain at business fixed investment is likely to cause said, the rate is expected to rise moderately toward the end of the projection period. This is based on the projection that, (1) the TFP growth reflecting adaptation to lifestyle changes that were caused stock will accelerate cyclically. However, there is a that COVID-19 will bring about structural changes in people's working styles and widespread adoption of working from home and changes could lead to a trend that is different from the past one. Thus, the output gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with more latitude than usual. In addition, there are high uncertainties at this point which are assumed to bring about a future rise in Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In the second half of fiscal 2020, with COVID-19 waning gradually, the economy is expected to continue picking up, mainly for pressure is expected to remain strong in the mainly for automobile-related goods, are likely to increasing, partly supported by inbound tourism demand, which is categorized as is expected restrictions to prevent COVID-19. Backed by the government's measures to support income and is projected to continue picking up with an increase COVID-19 being constrained and restrictions on business activities, including holding of events, being eased gradually. However, the pace of increase in private consumption is likely to be while people, seniors in particular, continue to be vigilant with regard to going out or contacting with others, and while social distancing remains a constraint on the supply side. Business fixed investment is projected to remain on a declining trend, with an increasing number of non-urgent projects being postponed against the background investment is expected to continue increasing related to restoration and reconstruction following natural disasters, as well as to building national government consumption is likely to decelerate compared with fiscal 2019, mainly due to a drop in overseas economies rise, an improving trend in Japan's economy is expected to become evident, partly supported by accommodative conditions. Exports, including those of capital goods and IT-related goods, are expected to continuing to wane, private consumption is likely to increase, albeit moderately, supported also by fixed investment is expected to turn to an uptrend, commercial facilities and hotels, is likely to remain at a low level. This is because, with corporate profits improving, business fixed investment is projected to be pushed up by an undertaking of postponed investment projects and an increase in digital-related investment to set up systems for government spending is likely to be at a high level, supported by expenditure on disaster-related related to the Olympic Games. In fiscal 2022, the economy is expected to continue growing firmly, with demand at home and abroad increasing in a well-balanced manner. Exports are likely to continue increasing clearly, reflecting improvement in overseas economies. In this situation, corporate profits are expected to follow their improving trend. Regarding business fixed investment, machinery investment is likely to see an acceleration in its growth pace, and also are likely to continue increasing. Private consumption is expected to continue increasing, including seniors, adapting lifestyle changes that were caused by COVID-19 Games-related expenditure will have been completed, government spending is likely to remain at a high level, due partly to demand for replacement of decaying Public investment has continued to increase moderately (Chart 4). The amount of public construction completed, which is a coincident indicator, has continued to increase moderately since early 2019.

On the other hand, the CPI is assumed to be pushed up by 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point from August 2021 through January 2022, due to a dissipation of the effects of the campaign. Looking at the CPI by fiscal year, the effects of the campaign on the year-on-year rates of change in both the CPI (all items less fresh food) and the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) are estimated to be minus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2020 and 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2021.

Based on staff calculations using the CPI (less fresh food) excluding the effects of the consumption tax hikes, policies concerning the provision of free education, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign, which covers a portion of domestic travel expenses.The CPI figures from April 2020 onward are based on staff estimations and exclude the effects of measures such as free higher education introduced in April 2020.CY 20 The trimmed mean is calculated by excluding items that belong to a certain percentage of the upper and lower tails of the price change distribution (10 percent of each tail) in order to eliminate the effects of large relative price changes. The mode is the inflation rate with the highest density in the price change distribution. The weighted median is the average of the inflation rates of the items at around the 50 percentile point of the cumulative distribution in terms of weight. All three indicators are calculated by using data for each CPI item that excludes the effects of the consumption tax hikes, policies concerning the provision of free education, and the \"Go To Travel\" campaign. determine inflation rates are assessed as follows.

The third factor is developments in import prices.

That said, price cuts that aim at stimulating demand have not been observed widely to date. As the background to seems that firms, mainly in the face-to-face services industry, which is confronted with a near term readily make price cuts that would lead to a further deterioration in their profits. This is because it is highly likely that the price elasticity of demand in the industry has become low in the is consumers' vigilance against those firms has been restrained in order to avoid creating crowds. In addition, it can be pointed out income has been supported by conditions.

Looking at software investment by industry, such investment is expected to substantially decline in drinking services industry, whereas it is projected to increase clearly mainly in the communications, the factors behind such firmness is the continuing trend of enhancing business efficiency and undertaking labor-saving investment since before the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, it seems have recently been taking an active stance toward making fixed investment for these growth areas. Turning to a breakdown by industry, business fixed investment has been decreasing in both the recently, but it is highly likely that investment in the manufacturing industry will pick up relatively early. Regarding the manufacturing industry, there is a quite high correlation between machinery real exports. Looking at they saw a was slow (Charts B2-3 and 11).

Looking at the situation for job changing by industry, it has been observed in the past that employed persons drinking services industry tended to make a B3-9). This is mainly because a large number of them are non-regular employees whose mobility is relatively high and reservation wage (the minimum wage level at which a worker will accept employment) tends to be low.

Compared with other age groups, seniors -- who are considered to have a relatively high risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 -- are more inclined to constrain spending activity that involves going out or contacting with others when the number of confirmed new cases increases. This could be a summer season. In fact, looking at consumption using the data from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey, they show the following: although it is necessary to take into account, for example, the size of fluctuations due to sample bias, consumption of services, such as dining out and travel, by seniors saw a larger decline and its subsequent pick-up has been slower in pace compared with other age groups (Chart B4-6). seniors is projected to constrain the pace of the 100-80-60-40-20020Apr. 20MayJuneJulyAug. change from CY 2015-2019 average, %1.

In the meantime, institutions have made progress addressing COVID-19, mainly in metropolitan confirmed severe cases has been constrained.

As for the outlook, it is consumption will be only moderate, with spending behavior, mainly by seniors, continuing to be cautious. However, given that consumer behavior under the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have been changing recently, the pick-up trend in face-to-face services consumption is projected to continue for the time being, supported also by the effects of demand stimulus measures including the \"Go To\" campaign (covering such areas as travel, dining out, and events). COVID-19 has affected the financial side. With a view to supporting financing, mainly of firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets, the Bank has actively made responses by conducting the following without setting upper limits, mainly by purchasing conducting COVID-19: total size of about 130 tril. yen + \u03b1 outstanding of about 20 tril. yen at maximum (previous Financing in Response to COVID-19: about 110 tril. yen Further active purchases of JGBs and T-Bills: unlimited Operations: unlimited \u2192 annual pace with the upper limit of about 12 tril. yen (for the time being) \u2192 annual pace with the upper limit of about 180 bil. yen (for the time being) J-REITs: annual pace of about 90 bil. yen Supporting Corporate Financing Special Program to Support Financing in Response to \u3000Purchases of CP and corporate bonds: amount amount outstanding of about 5 tril. yen) Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Stabilizing Financial Markets Ample and Flexible Provision of Yen and Foreign Currency Funds Enhancement of the U.S. Dollar Funds-Supplying Active Purchases of ETFs and J-REITs ETFs: annual pace of about 6 tril. yen These measures have had positive effects.

Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. \uf06c The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024, due to factors such as the effects, albeit waning, of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices and a waning of the effects of the government's economic measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. As for fiscal 2025, the rate of increase is projected to decelerate owing to dissipation of these factors. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise. The likelihood of realizing this outlook has continued to gradually rise, although there remain high uncertainties over future developments. \uf06c Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the projected real GDP growth rate is somewhat lower for fiscal 2023 and somewhat higher for fiscal 2024. The projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 is lower, mainly due to the effects of the recent decline in crude oil prices. \uf06c Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. \uf06c With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are generally balanced. In terms of prices, it should be noted that, mainly due to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation, the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in society. Considering this, it is important to closely monitor whether a virtuous cycle between wages and prices will intensify. 1 \"The Bank's View\" was decided by the Policy Board at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on January 22 and 23, 2024. Japan's economy has recovered moderately. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat. Corporate profits and business sentiment have improved. In this situation, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has continued to increase moderately, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative. increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has been relatively large, partly due to the government's economic measures. That said, the rate of increase in the CPI has been in the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices have remained, and services prices have increased moderately. Inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately for the time being, supported financial conditions and the government's economic measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a slowdown in the pace of recovery in measures are projected to wane, but Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected real GDP growth rate for fiscal 2023 is somewhat lower, mainly reflecting the actual data showing that the rate of change in business fixed investment has been lower than was previously projected. The projected growth rate for fiscal 2024 is somewhat In the household sector, employment is likely to continue rising, but the pace of increase is projected to moderate gradually. This is because it will become more difficult for labor supply to increase, with labor force participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. That said, these developments will lead to an increased employee income is projected to continue increasing. Against this backdrop, although private consumption is expected to be affected by the price rises, it is projected to keep increasing moderately for the time being. This is because pent-up demand is likely to materialize, partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of sentiment, which mainly reflects the rise in wage growth, are expected to provide support. Private consumption is also projected to be underpinned by the government's measures, such as (1) those to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity in income tax and inhabitant tax. Thereafter, although private consumption is likely to be affected by a slowdown in the materialization of pent-up demand and a waning of the positive contribution of the government's various measures, it is expected to keep increasing moderately, supported by the rise in employee income. In the corporate sector, exports and production are projected to be more or less flat for the time being, affected by the slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies. Subsequently, they are likely to return to an uptrend, mainly due to moderate growth in global demand for IT-related goods. Meanwhile, inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to continue increasing. Corporate profits are likely to keep improving, as it is projected that they will be pushed up for the time being by factors such as progress in the pass-through of past high raw material costs to selling prices, and thereafter by a moderate increase in domestic and external demand. In this situation, as accommodative financial conditions provide support, business fixed investment is likely to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address investment associated with strengthening supply chains. Toward the end of the projection period, it is expected to be under cyclical adjustment pressure stemming from the accumulation of capital stock, but investment to address labor shortages and investment that is not necessarily responsive to the business cycle, such as that related to decarbonization, are likely to increase Meanwhile, public investment is expected to be more or less flat, with expenditure related to building national resilience continuing. Government consumption is expected to decline temporarily in reflection of developments in expenditure related to COVID-19, and then gradually increase in reflection of an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Looking at the financial conditions on which the above outlook is based, it is expected that they will remain accommodative as the Bank pursues Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, and that this will support an increase in private demand.2 That is, the environment for external funding, such as bank borrowing and the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, is projected to remain accommodative. In this situation, firms' financial positions are likely to follow an improving trend along with the The potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately.3 This is mainly because productivity is likely to increase due to advances in digitalization and investment in human capital, and because capital stock growth is projected to accelerate due to a rise in business fixed investment. These developments are likely to be encouraged by the The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024, due to factors such as the effects, albeit waning, of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices and a waning of the effects of the government's economic measures pushing down CPI inflation of the previous year. As for fiscal 2025, the rate of increase is projected to decelerate owing to dissipation of these factors. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to long-term Comparing the projections with those presented in the previous Outlook Report, the projected year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2024 is lower, mainly due to the effects of the recent decline in crude oil prices. The outlook for the CPI (all items less fresh food) depends on the assumptions regarding crude oil prices and the government's economic measures. Crude oil prices are assumed to decline moderately toward the end of the projection period with reference, for example, to developments in futures markets. The government's measures to reduce the household burden of higher gasoline prices, electricity charges, and gas charges are expected to 2023. For fiscal 2024 and 2025, on the other hand, they are projected to push up the rates due to a waning of the effects of those measures pushing down CPI inflation of each 2 Each Policy Board member makes their forecasts taking into account the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding the future conduct of policy. 3 Under a specific methodology, Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. However, the rate should be interpreted with considerable latitude. This is because the estimate is subject to change depending on the methodologies employed and could be revised as the sample period becomes longer over time. In addition, there are particularly high uncertainties in the current phase over how COVID-19 will affect the trends in productivity or labor supply. previous year.4 In this regard, looking at the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) -- which is not directly affected by fluctuations in energy prices -- the year-on-year rate of increase is likely to decelerate, due to a gradual waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices, and subsequently be at around 2 percent toward the end of the projection period. The main factors that determine underlying inflation are assessed as follows. The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has followed an improving trend. Based on the aforementioned outlook for economic activity, the gap is likely to widen gradually slowing pace. Under these circumstances, labor market conditions are expected to tighten, partly due to a deceleration in the pace of increase in labor force participation of women and seniors, and upward pressure on wages is projected to intensify. This is likely to put upward pressure on personnel expenses on the cost side and contribute to an increase in households' purchasing power. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have risen moderately. The December 2023 Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that the diffusion index (DI) for output prices is lower than a while ago but has remained at a high level, and that figures for firms' inflation outlook for general prices have declined somewhat for the short term but have remained at high levels for the medium to long term. Given that the formation of inflation expectations in Japan is largely adaptive, the increase in inflation seen thus far has brought about a rise in households' and firms' medium- to long-term inflation expectations. In this situation, firms' behavior has shifted more toward raising wages and prices. Regarding the outlook, inflation expectations are expected to rise labor-management wage negotiations. Under these circumstances, a virtuous cycle between wages and prices is projected to intensify through achievement of wage increases that reflect price rises and through a pass-through of wage increases to selling Considering the above assessments, underlying CPI inflation is likely to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target. Taking account, for example, of management toward wage negotiations, the likelihood of realizing this outlook has 4 The Comprehensive Economic Measures to Completely Break Free from Deflation were decided by the Cabinet in November 2023. As part of these measures, the government decided to continue with measures to reduce the burden of higher gasoline prices through April 2024. It also decided that measures to reduce the burden of higher electricity and gas charges will remain effective for charges on these types of energy consumed through May 2024. Assuming that these measures to reduce those various burdens will not be extended and will be phased out, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food), mainly for fiscal 2024, will be pushed up by a waning of the effects of these measures pushing down CPI inflation of each previous year. continued to gradually rise, although there remain high uncertainties over future Regarding the aforementioned baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity, the main upside and downside risks that require attention are as follows. The first is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Although inflationary pressure has remained on a global basis, inflation rates in the United States and Europe are lower than a while ago. In this situation, overseas central banks have continued to conduct tight monetary policy, but some have apparently signaled future policy interest rate reductions. On this point, it is expected in the baseline scenario that inflation rates around the world will decline gradually and that overseas economies will continue to grow moderately, albeit with variation across countries and regions. There is also a possibility that, if inflationary pressure wanes further, moves to reduce policy interest rates will strengthen and affect these economies. On the other hand, there is a risk of inflation rates staying elevated through wage increases, mainly in advanced economies. In addition, since the policy interest rate hikes by overseas central banks to date have been rapid, there are high uncertainties over how these hikes will affect their real economies and financial systems with a time lag. Taking these risks into account, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial Meanwhile, depending on the course of the situation surrounding Ukraine, downward pressure on overseas economies, particularly the euro area, could heighten. In addition, regarding the Chinese economy, there are high uncertainties surrounding the future pace of pick-up, as adjustment pressure has remained in the labor and real estate markets. The second risk is developments in import prices, particularly those of commodities, including grains. While prices of grains and other commodities had declined on the whole -- albeit with fluctuations -- after reaching their peak around the middle of 2022, attention continues to be warranted on the risk that these prices will fluctuate significantly due to geopolitical factors, such as those concerning Ukraine and the Middle East. Furthermore, in the medium to long term, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding, for example, efforts by countries around the world toward addressing climate change. Given that Japan is an importer of commodities such as energy and grains (e.g., wheat), a rise in these prices due to supply factors puts greater downward pressure on the economy through an increase in import costs, as this rise is not accompanied by an expansion in external demand or an increase in exports. If the terms of trade were to deteriorate again, this could squeeze corporate profits and households' real income, leading business fixed investment and private consumption to deviate downward from the baseline scenario increases were to be limited, this could further strengthen households' defensive attitudes toward spending and push down the economy. On the other hand, if prices of commodities, including grains, decline, the economy could deviate upward. The third risk considered from a somewhat long-term perspective is firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations. It is expected that factors such as moves toward digitalization, which reflect the experience of COVID-19 and intensifying market reform will change Japan's economic structure and people's working styles. Furthermore, the heightened geopolitical risks could change the trend of globalization, which has supported the growth of the global economy to date. Depending on how firms and households react to these changes, their medium- to long-term growth expectations, the potential growth rate, and the output gap could go either up or down. If the aforementioned risks to economic activity materialize, prices also are likely to be affected. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the following two risks that are The first is high uncertainties over firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, which could exert either upward or downward pressure on prices. In the current inflationary phase, with Japan's economy following a recovery trend and against the backdrop of high raw material costs, many firms have raised prices while giving consideration to price setting by consumer prices have been gradually waning, this pass-through could continue for longer than expected and lead prices to deviate upward from the baseline scenario, depending on how much upward pressure will be exerted by raw material costs and on how firms' inflation expectations will develop. In addition, with labor market conditions tightening, it is possible that firms will further shift their wage-setting behavior toward raising wages, in view of factors such as recruitment and retention. Under these circumstances, there is a possibility that both wages and prices will deviate upward from the baseline scenario to a greater extent than can be explained by changes in the output gap, as moves to reflect become more widespread than expected. On the other hand, with inflation decelerating, medium- to long-term inflation expectations could decline through the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation, and this could affect firms' price-setting behavior. In addition, although the wage growth rate agreed in the annual spring labor-management wage negotiations last year was significantly higher than in the previous year, if the behavior and mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily remain deeply entrenched, there is a risk that moves to increase wages will not strengthen as much as expected and prices will deviate downward from the baseline The second risk is future developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices, as well as the extent to which such developments will spread to import prices and domestic prices. This risk may lead prices to deviate either upward or downward from the baseline scenario. There are high uncertainties over, for example, the outlook for the global economy, and this could lead to significant fluctuations in international commodity prices. Including the possibility of inflation rates staying elevated affect Japan's prices requires due attention. In the context of the price stability target, the Bank assesses the aforementioned economic and price situation from two perspectives and then outlines its thinking on the The first perspective involves an examination of the baseline scenario of the outlook. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be above 2 percent through fiscal 2024 and then decelerate in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, toward the end of the projection period, underlying CPI inflation is expected to increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target, as the output gap turns positive and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise. The likelihood of realizing this outlook has continued to gradually rise, although there remain high uncertainties over future developments. The second perspective involves an examination of the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy. There are extremely high uncertainties, both upside and downside, surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, and it is necessary to pay on economic activity and prices. With regard to the risk balance, risks to both economic activity and prices are generally balanced. In terms of prices, it should be noted that, mindset based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have taken hold in society. Considering this, it is important to closely monitor whether a virtuous cycle between wages and prices will intensify. 5 As for the examination from two perspectives in the context of the price stability target, see the Bank's statement released on January 22, 2013, entitled \"The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy.\" Examining risks on the financial side, overheating has not been seen in asset markets and financial institutions' credit activities. Japan's financial system has maintained stability on the whole. Although attention is warranted on, for example, the impact of the tightening of global financial conditions, the financial system is likely to remain highly robust on the global financial markets, mainly because Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital bases. When examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective, if declining population, and excess savings in the corporate sector, becomes prolonged, this could create a risk of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, under these circumstances, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. As for the conduct of monetary policy, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases. The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain the stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if Forecasts made in October 2023 Forecasts made in October 2023 Forecasts made in October 2023 Notes: 1.

Real GDP rose for three consecutive quarters, registering 0.9 percent on a quarter-on-quarter percent on an annualized basis (Chart 1). It then decreased registering minus on an annualized basis. Relative to the previous quarter, private consumption slightly declined and business fixed investment decreased. Meanwhile, net exports were unchanged and, owing to public investment was more or less flat. The output gap -- which captures the utilization of labor and capital -- remained on an improving trend, although it was slightly negative for the July-September quarter, which reflects the fact manufacturing industry declined somewhat (Chart 35-30-25-20-15-10-50510152025301314151617181920212223 Real GDPs.a., ann., q/q % chg.2.

As for the outlook, the potential growth rate is expected to rise moderately. This is based on the projection that, although there will be less room for the number of employed persons to increase, (1) TFP will continue to grow, mainly on the back of resulting capital, (2) the decline in working hours will come to a halt in reflection of the diminishing effects of stock will accelerate.

It is also possible that will have a significant gap and the potential growth rate, which are estimated based on a specific assumption regarding trends, should be interpreted with some Details of the outlook for each fiscal year are as follows. In the second half of fiscal 2023, Japan's is to continue recovering moderately, supported by the materialization of is expected to exert exports are projected to be more or less flat despite being affected by the slowdown, mainly because IT-related demand is likely to head toward a pick-up. Inbound tourism demand, which is categorized under services exports, is expected to keep increasing. With corporate profits improving, business fixed investment is projected to continue on an increasing trend, mainly on the the household sector, employment is likely to rise wage growth is expected to remain relatively high. Due to these factors, nominal employee income is to keep rising. Moreover, downward pressure on households' real income stemming from high prices is expected to ease. This will increases led by the past rise in import prices. Against this backdrop, private consumption is projected to keep increasing moderately due to factors such as pent-up demand, which is partly supported by household savings that had accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions. Government spending is expected to decline, reflecting a reduction in expenditure related to COVID-19, although it is likely to be supported by progress in construction related to building national resilience and by an uptrend in healthcare and nursing care expenditures. In fiscal 2024, Japan's economy is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growing being maintained. As overseas economies grow and regions, goods exports are likely to see a moderate increase. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed is expected to continue on an increasing trend, including investment to address decarbonization, and investment associated with strengthening supply chains. In the household sector, nominal employee income is likely to continue increasing steadily. This is because wage growth is expected to remain relatively high, although it will gradually become more difficult for participation of women and seniors having advanced to a high degree thus far. Moreover, tax by the government are projected to push up consumption is to continue increasing is projected to gradually wane. Government spending is expected to turn to a moderate related to building national resilience and an In fiscal 2025, although pent-up demand is expected to diminish, domestic and external demand is projected to continue increasing. Goods exports are likely to increase moderately, with overseas economies continuing to grow. Inbound tourism demand is projected to keep increasing. Business fixed investment is also expected to continue increasing, mainly to address decarbonization; however, the pace of increase is projected to slow somewhat, partly because it is likely to be pushed down by adjustment pressure on capital stock. Although pent-up demand is to diminish, private consumption is projected to continue increasing moderately, with income situation continuing improve, supported by wage is expected to keep increasing healthcare and nursing care expenditures. Public investment has been more or less flat (Chart 4). While construction based on the including construction related to building national resilience, has progressed, the amount of public construction completed -- a coincident indicator of public investment -- has been more or less flat, partly projects.

In these measures, public investment projects for disaster prevention, disaster mitigation, and building national resilience are to be implemented intensively over five years from fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2025. The government's economic measures decided by the Cabinet in November 2023 also include efforts to implement the acceleration measures. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed (Chart 5). By region, the U.S. economy has been firm, mainly led by private consumption, although it has been affected by policy interest rate hikes.

After gradually reducing the subsidies from January 2023, the government revised the measure and expanded the subsidies in early September, in response to crude oil prices rising again. With regard to electricity charges, through its measures to reduce the household burden, electricity charges were cut by 7 yen per kilowatt-hour (roughly a 20 percent discount per month for typical households) for the period from February through September 2023, and have been cut by 3.5 yen per kilowatt-hour since October (the months refer to the timing at which electricity charges are calculated).
