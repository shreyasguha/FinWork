{"file1": "The forty third meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during June 6 to 8, 2023. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (June 8, 2023) decided to: Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent. The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. In the second quarter of 2023, the global economy is sustaining the momentum gained in the preceding quarter in spite of still elevated though moderating inflation, tighter financial conditions, banking sector stress, and lingering geopolitical conflicts. Sovereign bond yields are trading sideways on expectations of the imminent peaking of the tightening cycle of monetary policy while the US dollar has appreciated. Equity markets have remained range bound since the last MPC meeting. For several emerging levels and market economies (EMEs), weak external demand, elevated debt geoeconomic disintegration amidst tighter external financial conditions pose risks to growth prospects, although capital flows are cautiously returning to them on renewed risk appetite. Domestic Economy According to the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office 7. (NSO) on May 31, 2023, India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated from 4.5 per cent (year-on-year, y-o-y) in Q3:2022-23 to 6.1 per cent in Q4, supported by fixed investment and higher net exports. Real GDP growth for 2022-23 was placed at 7.2 per cent, higher than the second advance estimate of 7.0 per cent. 8. Domestic economic activity remains resilient in Q1:2023-24 as reflected in high frequency indicators. Purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMI) for manufacturing and services indicated sustained expansion, with the manufacturing PMI at a 31-month high in May and services PMI at a 13-year high in April-May. In the services sector, domestic air passenger traffic, e-way bills, toll collections and diesel consumption exhibited buoyancy in April-May, while railway freight and port traffic registered modest growth. 9. On the demand side, urban spending remains robust as reflected in indicators such as passenger vehicle sales and domestic air passenger traffic which recorded double digit growth in April. Rural demand is gradually improving though unevenly \u2013 motorcycle sales expanded in April, while tractor sales contracted partly owing to unseasonal rains. Investment activity is picking up as reflected in the healthy expansion in steel consumption and cement output in April. Merchandise exports and non-oil non- gold imports remained in contraction mode in April while services exports sustained a robust expansion. 10. CPI inflation fell sharply to 4.7 per cent in April 2023 from 6.4 per cent in February on the back of large favourable base effects, with softening observed across all the three major groups. Food group inflation eased, with moderation in cereals, eggs, milk, fruits, meat and fish, spices and prepared meals inflation and deepening of deflation in edible oils. In the fuel group, inflation in LPG and firewood and chips prices fell and kerosene prices slipped into deflation. Core inflation (i.e., CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) dipped, driven down by clothing and footwear, household goods and services, health, transport and communication, personal care and effects and recreation and amusement sub-groups. 11. The average daily absorption under the LAF increased to \u20b91.7 lakh crore during April-May from \u20b91.4 lakh crore in February-March. Money supply (M3) expanded by 10.1 per cent y-o-y and non-food bank credit by 15.6 per cent as on May 19, 2023. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 595.1 billion as on June 2, 2023. 12. Going forward, the headline inflation trajectory is likely to be shaped by food price dynamics. Wheat prices could see some correction on robust mandi arrivals and procurement. Milk prices, on the other hand, are likely to remain under pressure due to supply shortfalls and high fodder costs. The forecast of a normal south-west monsoon by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) augurs well for kharif crops; however, the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon would need to be closely monitored to assess the prospects for agricultural production. Crude oil prices have eased but the outlook remains uncertain. According to the early results from the Reserve Bank\u2019s surveys, manufacturing, services and infrastructure firms polled expect input costs and output prices to harden. A clearer picture will emerge when the final survey results are available. Taking into account these factors and assuming a normal monsoon, CPI inflation is projected at 5.1 per cent for 2023-24, with Q1 at 4.6 per cent, Q2 at 5.2 per cent, Q3 at 5.4 per cent and Q4 at 5.2 per cent. The risks are evenly balanced (Chart 1). 13. The higher rabi crop production in 2022-23, the expected normal monsoon, and the sustained buoyancy in services should support private consumption and overall economic activity in the current year. The government\u2019s thrust on capital expenditure, moderation in commodity prices and robust credit growth are expected to nurture investment activity. Weak external demand, geoeconomic fragmentation, and protracted geopolitical tensions, however, pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent with Q1 at 8.0 per cent, Q2 at 6.5 per cent, Q3 at 6.0 per cent, and Q4 at 5.7 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). 14. The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures. Headline inflation is projected to decline in 2023-24 from its level in 2022-23 but would still be above the target, warranting continuous vigil. The progress of the south west monsoon is critical in this regard. Domestic economic activity is holding up well. Consumer confidence is improving and businesses remain optimistic about the future. The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is transmitting through the economy and its fuller impact should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months. Monetary policy would need to be carefully calibrated for alignment of inflation with the target. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. The MPC resolved to continue keeping a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook. It will take further monetary actions promptly and appropriately as required to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored and to bring down inflation to the target. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 15. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. 16. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on June 22, 2023. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during August 8-10, 2023. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent 19. Since the April meeting of the MPC, the GDP growth numbers for FY 2022-23 have been updated and we also have the headline inflation numbers for April 2023. The official provisional estimates (PE) for GDP at constant prices place the GDP growth higher at 7.2 per cent for FY 2022-23 from 7 per cent in the Second Advance Estimates. The headline YOY inflation rate in April dropped to 4.7 per cent, well below the rate in March, 5.7 per cent. A significant part of the improvement in GDP in FY 2022-23 was due to the growth in Q4 FY 2022-23 at 6.1 per cent in comparison to the expectations of growth of 5.1 per cent implied by the overall growth rate of 7 per cent in SAE. The better than anticipated growth in Q4 combined with the lower inflation reading for March-April reflect different sets of factors influencing growth and inflation. 20. The global macroeconomic conditions have continued to be adverse, reflecting slow growth momentum and moderating but elevated inflation pressures across economies. In addition, global trading opportunities have been limited by policies restricting supply chains. The recent events have also pointed to the vulnerability of the banking and financial sectors to monetary and fiscal policy stances. The energy markets experienced uncertainty in the face of global economic slowdown and the protracted Ukraine war. The monetary policy measures aimed at curbing inflationary pressures in the major advanced and emerging market economies appear to be successful in moderating inflation rate, although the rates remain well above the policy targets. This provides an overall context for an assessment of the likely course of growth 21. and inflation in the short to medium term. One important feature of GDP growth in 2022- 23 and also 2021-22 was the dominance of Q1 compared to the other quarters. As the pandemic induced sharp decline in GDP in Q1 of 2020-21 is offset by the subsequent growth, growth in Q1:2023-24 is likely to be closer to the growth across quarters. A second feature of growth performance in 2022-23 is the uneven performance across sectors. Manufacturing growth reflected in the growth of Gross Value Added (GVA) is placed at 1.3 per cent compared to the growth in construction (10.0 per cent) or the services sector (9.5 per cent). While the input cost pressures in 2022-23 appear to have had greater impact in the case of manufacturing than in the other sectors, slower growth of consumption spending and investment would also have affected demand for manufacturing more than the others. Finally, the deceleration in export demand would affect manufacturing output. Going forward, reduction in cost pressures and overall inflation, and revival of exports would be important in accelerating manufacturing growth. The indicators compiled by RBI for listed manufacturing companies in Q4: 2022-23 indicate significant improvement in profit margins with increased GVA growth and sustained improvement in capacity utilisation during the year are positive for the revival of manufacturing growth in 2023-24. However, there are segments within manufacturing sector where weak export environment would be a concern. The services sector was the growth driver for the economy in 2022-23. Revival of 22. demand in the service sectors badly hit during the pandemic has sustained the growth of the overall sector. GVA growth in the sub-sector Trade, Hotels, Transportation and Broadcasting in 2022-23 is still only 4.1 per cent over its pre-pandemic level in 2019-20 with considerable upside potential of the sub-sector for growth. The export of services is expected to be adversely affected by the global economic slowdown in 2023-24. In the case of agriculture and allied sectors, GVA growth in 2022-23 turned out to 23. be higher than 2021-22 although there were adverse weather effects during the year. The normal monsoon forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department, despite the emergence of the El Nino phenomenon, would be supportive of agricultural growth. 24. On the demand side of the economy, RBI\u2019s recent sample surveys of households and enterprises indicate improving consumer sentiments and business outlook for 2023- 24. The improvement is, however, in comparison to a period of weak sentiments through 2022-23. Early results of the enterprise surveys indicate greater optimism on the part of services and infrastructure firms on demand conditions than in the case of manufacturing. The Consumer Confidence Survey of urban households conducted in May reflects steady improvement in confidence for the current period and strengthening optimism on \u2018one- year ahead\u2019 situation. Expenditure expectations remain broadly stable with indications of increasing non-essential expenditure by the households. While cost pressures are expected to moderate in Q1, the expectation of rising costs \u2013 inputs, financing and staff \u2013 is still widely shared especially in Q2. Higher selling prices are seen to improve profit margin. In the sectors where demand is buoyant, transmission of higher costs to selling prices would be greater. Overall, perceptions on cost pressures and selling prices vary across sectors. 25. The high frequency indicators for the recent period of April-May provide a mixed picture. The urban and demand conditions show improvement, PMIs for manufacturing and services reflect rising output. However, there are also mixed signs of transport activity. Railway freight and port traffic, and motor spirit sale show YOY growth rates of less than five per cent but E-way bills and toll collections continue to register double digit growth. External trade has weakened in April. Non-food credit, a broader measure of economic activity, has increased by about 16 per cent during April-May 2023. 26. The overall growth momentum for 2023-24 is expected to be more moderate than in 2022-23. The projections provided in the April meeting of the MPC hold over the improved official estimates for 2022-23. The GDP growth for 2023-24 is retained at 6.5 per cent YOY basis. The quarterly YOY growth projections are Q1: 8.0 per cent, Q2: 6.5 per cent, Q3: 6.0 per cent and Q4: 5.7 per cent, respectively. The significant downside risks to growth are the unfavourable rainfall conditions during the monsoon season, steeper than expected decline in global demand conditions and supply chain disruptions due to spillovers from the geo-political conflicts. As compared to the April forecast, the quarterly growth rates in Q1 and Q2 are revised upward and Q3 and Q4 downward in the present set of projections. RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters provides a median forecast of 6.0 per cent for 2023-24, the same as in the previous round. 27. The headline inflation rate, YOY, dropped further to below 5 per cent mark in April, following the decline to below 6 per cent in March. The rate of price rise fell in all three main categories of consumption basket: food, fuel and the \u2018core\u2019. The decline was steeper in fuel and food than the \u2018core\u2019. This broad-based decline in the inflation rate was also seen in March. A number of factors have contributed to the significant decline in inflation rate in March and April: deceleration in the commodity prices in the international markets; decline in the inflation rates in the major economies, although they remain well above the targets; favourable base effects; and the impact of monetary and policy measures on inflation directly and through their impact on inflation expectations. RBI\u2019s recent Inflation Expectations Survey of Urban Households finds that along with the perceived current inflation rates, the median expected inflation rate on a 3-months ahead and one-year ahead horizons is declining as compared to their levels in the previous round. 28. Taking into account the current trends and assessment of factors influencing price trends, RBI\u2019s projected average headline inflation rate for FY 2023-24 is 5.1 per cent, with quarterly projections of 4.6 per cent in Q1, 5.2 per cent in Q2, 5.4 per cent in Q3 and 5.2 per cent in Q4. The projected inflation rate for FY 2023-24 is well below the rate of 6.7 per cent experienced in the previous year and close to the median forecast of 5.0 per cent for FY 2023-24 in the RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters. 29. However, a few concerns remain on the question of sustainability of the trends seen in March and April headline inflation rate. Several sub-categories of consumption basket still register price rise of well-above 6 per cent. Price rise, YOY basis, in the case of cereals and products is in double digits, and in milk and products above 8 per cent in March and April. Clothing and footwear and Household goods and services also are at or above 6 per cent rate of price rise in March and April. Among the broad groupings of items in the consumption basket excluding (1) Food and beverages, (2) Pan, tobacco and intoxicants and (3) Fuel and light, items with YOY price rise of 6 per cent or more account for 45 per cent of the weight of this broad group. The month over month change is higher in April as compared to March for several commodity groups although significant \u2018base effects\u2019 have lowered the YOY headline inflation rate. These issues require consideration in assessing the sustainability of moderating trend in headline inflation rate to the target of 4 per cent. 30. The decline in the overall headline inflation in the recent two months combined with the strong growth performance in Q4: FY 2022-23 suggest a trajectory of lower YOY inflation of 5 per cent and GDP growth of above 6 per cent in FY 2023-24. The projected inflation rate is below the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent but well above the target of 4 per cent. There are also upside risks to inflation both on account of the evolution of sectoral price trends and developments at the global level. The impact of increase in policy rate between May 2022 and April 2023 by 250 basis points and other economic policy measures have been crucial in anchoring price expectations. As transmission of the policy changes through the economy to reach the inflation target is subject to unpredictable developments, it is necessary to ensure that the policy framework is focused on achieving the inflation target while supporting growth. 31. Accordingly, I vote: (a) to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and (b) to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 32. Global uncertainty continues although its economic impact has been less severe than expected. Major advanced economy (AE) central banks have slowed their tightening. Inflation is softening although it continues to be above target. They have shifted to a more data-based approach and are more willing to wait for the lagged effects of past tightening. Inflation has not been high for as long as it was in the seventies so there is less reason to fear persistence without higher for longer policy rates. Labour markets remain tight, but this may partly reflect labour hoarding by employers following the post Covid-19 labour shortages so that tightness may be overestimated. AE fiscal tightening has less global spillovers compared to monetary tightening so more AE fiscal consolidation may reduce pressures on monetary policy. 33. Indian growth outperformed market expectations but did fall from 9.1% in FY22 to 7.2% in FY23. Some turnaround in manufacturing and continued growth in fixed investment in Q4FY23 augurs well for the future, however. Construction also remains robust, but consumption and exports have areas of softness, pent up demand for services may moderate, and unemployment remains high. 34. Inflation has moderated into the tolerance band but is not yet firmly on the path to target, particularly in view of monsoon related uncertainties. Even so, it is clear that core inflation is neither persistent nor broad-based. Core inflation fell from 6.2% in January to 5.1% in April this year. Softening is to be expected in the absence of true second round effects from excess demand or from tight labour markets. Inflation was higher for so long because of multiple supply shocks. 35. Going ahead firms\u2019 input output price gap is almost closed, profit margins rose sharply in Q4FY23, input costs have fallen, wage pressures are not there, and since demand is slack they are unlikely to raise prices. WPI inflation, that has a larger weight of manufacturing prices, is negative. The IIM Ahmedabad business expectation survey shows a moderation in firms\u2019 one year ahead price and cost inflation as well as sales expectations. Preliminary results from the RBI enterprise surveys, however, show firms expecting price and cost inflation to rise, despite actual costs and inflation softening. This may be due to fears about the monsoon and bears watching over the next few months. 36. The quick succession of repo rate raises has brought the real rate to near equilibrium levels, which has prevented over-heating as well as over-tightening of demand and helped to anchor inflation expectations. The slowdown and pause was also well-timed. 37. It is necessary to build on the learning of the past few years where allowing sufficient nominal variation in repo and exchange rates to keep real rates near equilibrium has helped smooth shocks and sustain Indian growth resilience. The experience has shown that independence from AE monetary cycles is feasible and foreign inflows are not tightly linked to the interest rate differential with AE rates. Flexibility in inflation targeting, intervention in FX markets to reduce excess volatility, economic diversity, supply-side action and good monetary-fiscal coordination under supply shocks have all contributed to better outcomes. 38. As expected inflation falls, however, it is important that real repo rate does not rise too high. This is what happened in 2015 as international oil prices fell, damaging the economic cycle. Research suggests that the inflation targeting regime has contributed to reducing inflation expectations. Commitment to such a regime only involves aligning the nominal repo rate with expected inflation. Such action, together with the greater impact of official communication in emerging markets, is adequate to bring inflation to target as the effect of shocks dies down. It does not require the nominal repo to be kept higher for longer. 39. But in this meeting, it is appropriate for the MPC to pause. I also vote for the present stance to continue since at present it is not possible to give a signal about future action. The latter will be conditional on the data coming in. The pause is only for the current meeting. Moreover, transient events have created a liquidity surplus, so that withdrawal of liquidity itself is also required. 40. The outlook on inflation and growth has changed only marginally between the April meeting and this meeting. The two inflationary risks that I spoke about in April (crude prices and the monsoon) have become a little less worrisome. On the crude oil front, it is now clear that OPEC+ is struggling to reduce supply adequately to counter sluggish demand, and the risk of a substantial spike in crude price in the near term is not very high. As regards the monsoon, the official forecast of a normal monsoon provides some comfort, but it is tempered by the fact that the forecast includes an almost even chance of monsoon being below normal or worse. Fortunately, the forecast likelihood of a deficient monsoon is only marginally higher than the climatological probability, and the chance of a drought appears to be rather remote. This augurs well because the Indian economy is quite resilient to a monsoon which is somewhat below normal if its spatial and temporal distribution is satisfactory. Another indication of a slight reduction in inflationary risks is the slight decline in the RBI projections of inflation for 2023-24 between the April and June meetings. Similarly, the outlook for growth remains more or less the same as in April with several high frequency indicators suggesting that growth is not as robust as we would like. 41. Considering the balance of risks, I vote for keeping the repo rate unchanged in this meeting. I am of the view that the current level of the repo rate is high enough to keep inflation below the upper tolerance band on a sustained basis and also glide it towards the middle of the band. However, there are significant risks to both inflation and growth, and the process of bringing inflation under control is still very much work in progress. It would be premature to declare victory at this point of time based on the inflation prints of just a couple of months. In this context, I am not at all comfortable with the self- congratulatory tone of the statement in the MPC Monetary Policy Statement that \u201cThe MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures.\u201d 42. Turning to the stance, I find that with every successive meeting, this stance is becoming more and more disconnected from reality. Based on the forecast inflation for 5.1% for 2023-24, the real repo rate is now almost 1\u00bd%. (The real short term rate could well be above that level since in recent weeks, many money market rates have often drifted towards the MSF rate of 6.75%). In other words, monetary policy is now dangerously close to levels at which it can inflict significant damage to the economy. Despite this, the majority of the MPC wishes to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation whatever that phrase might mean. I have therefore seriously considered dissenting on this part of the resolution, but after careful thought I have decided to confine myself to expressing reservations on it. The main reason for not dissenting is that, after two successive meetings at which the repo rate has been left unchanged, this stance now appears more vestigial than a serious statement of intent. 43. The reasons outlined for a pause in rate action in my previous statement of April 2023 broadly hold for this meeting as well. Moreover, as the latest prints of growth and inflation indicate a Goldilocks scenario, with growth higher and inflation marginally lower than anticipated, this is telling us that our cumulative actions taken so far are working in the right direction. It needs to be acknowledged, however, that knowing when to stop is hard. The effects of tight policy will continue to percolate through the system months after the pause. If policy makers continue tightening until inflation falls as much as they want, they are likely to go farther than they need to (Romer and Romer, 2023)1. Notwithstanding this, it is important that we do not drop our guard against inflation, especially when we are still away from our primary goal of aligning inflation to the 4.0 per cent target. 44. On the domestic growth front, the optimism spelt out in my earlier minutes has materialised, with the acceleration in real GDP growth for Q4:2022-23 to 6.1 per cent from 4.5 per cent in the preceding quarter. The quarter-on-quarter (qoq) seasonally adjusted momentum in Q4 at 2.9 per cent, well above the pre-pandemic average of 1.7 per cent (2012-13 to 2019-20), bodes well for growth going forward. Furthermore, there are clear signs of economic activity holding up well in Q1:2023-242 as indicated by various high frequency indicators and this optimism is expected to follow through in the remaining quarters of 2023-24. This stems from three factors: (i) revival in rural consumption; (ii) private corporate investment gaining steam; and (iii) moderating drag from net external demand. Let me elaborate. Rural demand is supported by the robust rabi foodgrains production and expected normal monsoon.3 Given the low share of agriculture in aggregate GVA (around 15 per cent in 2022-23) and its contribution to GDP growth, even if monsoon turns out be lower than normal, its impact on growth may not be significant. On the other hand, deficient monsoon could have a more tangible impact on inflation due to the higher share of food items in the CPI consumption basket. There is an increasing revival in corporate investment due to slackening of input 45. cost pressures and rising capacity utilisation. Credit growth to industry has improved driven by large industries, particularly, roads, steel, cement, construction, petroleum and chemicals. On the supply side, manufacturing sector performance, which turned positive in Q4:2022-23, is likely to improve further with softening commodity prices, normalisation of supply chains and production linked incentive (PLI) scheme gaining traction. Manufacturing companies in several key sectors have expanded their fixed assets. Services sector constituted about 63 per cent share in aggregate gross value added (GVA) and contributed around 83 per cent to growth in GVA during 2022-23 and is expected to remain the mainstay of growth in 2023-24. Higher contraction in merchandise imports coupled with buoyant services exports are improving net external demand. 46. Headline CPI inflation fell sharply by 1.7 percentage points between February and April 2023, supported by favourable base effects and soft price momentum. The softening in core inflation was seen across various exclusion based as well as trimmed 1 Romer C.D. and David H. Romer (2023), \u201cDoes Monetary Policy Matter? The Narrative Approach after 35 Years\u201d, American Economic Review, Vol. 113, Issue 6, June. 2 Real GDP in Q1:2023-24 will also benefit from base effect which is yet to normalise. 3 Around 55 per cent of rabi production is accounted for in Q1:2023-24. mean measures. CPI diffusion indices indicate that a majority of the CPI items saw price increases less than a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of 6 per cent during March-April 2023, a significant reversal from February. All these suggest some waning of price pressures in CPI in recent months, as the impact of monetary policy actions, supply side measures and easing of global commodity prices played through. Inflation, however, is likely to remain well above the target rate of 4 per cent throughout the year. 47. We have been prudent in our approach using the flexibility imbedded in the framework to operate within the tolerance band in balancing macroeconomic priorities depending upon the need of the hour. With greater clarity on macro fronts, prudence requires that we now focus on aligning inflation to the target of 4 per cent. Time is opportune to emphasise the distinction between the inflation target and tolerance of deviations from the target. The tolerance band can be conceptually broken down into an uncertainty range4 owing to imperfect knowledge of the (present and future) state of the economy; the indifference range over which monetary policy is not expected to react; and finally, the operational range that allows for intentional deviations to exercise short-run trade-offs between inflation and growth (Chung et al, 2020).5 Sustained deviations of inflation from the target may lead to a steady drift of inflation expectations. The risk of ceding part of the operational range to the indifference range makes it imperative to emphasise the primacy of the 4 per cent inflation target. This is crucial to support the ongoing process of anchoring inflation expectations around the target. Moreover, real policy rate continues to be positive which will further anchor inflation expectations. The rate pause in April seems to have had a sobering impact on domestic financial 48. conditions. For instance, the average spread of the 10-year G-sec yield over the 1-year G-sec, 91-day Treasury bills, and the policy repo rate moderated to 20 bps, 29 bps and 58 bps, respectively, during April 6-June 7, 2023. In the credit market, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans and the weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on fresh deposits of scheduled commercial banks fell by 23 bps and 12 bps, respectively, in April 2023. Such an easing of financial conditions occurred, even as the MPC had unequivocally argued that the pause was specific to the April policy and not a policy pivot. Accordingly, continuity in the stance with a clear-cut objective of aligning inflation to the 4 per cent target is important. Any premature change in stance may be hasty and could undo the hard work done so far. It may also tamper with the transmission process that is currently underway. Recent actions of some advanced economies reverting back to rate hikes after a pause need to be kept in mind. Thus, I vote for a pause in rate action and continuity of stance. Monetary policy actions would need to be calibrated carefully by assessing the impact of past actions, meticulously scrutinising the incoming data, and responding appropriately to the evolving macroeconomic conditions. 49. Macroeconomic outcomes have broadly evolved along projected paths, vindicating the April 2023 monetary policy decision and stance. This provides elbow room to re- assess the evolving outlook with information gleaned from current rounds of forward- looking surveys and updated forecasts of goal variables, while keeping in mind the cumulative actions already taken and the lags of monetary policy\u2019s effects on the economy. 4 This comprises forecast errors, Knightian uncertainty, among others. 5 https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2020075pap.pdf 50. Overall, the outlook for real GDP growth in India is brighter than in April. Global risks appear contained for now, but idiosyncratic monsoon-related risks have risen and need to be seen off over the ensuing months. Financial conditions have eased considerably, and domestic financial markets are reflecting a stable growth outlook along with re-anchoring of inflation expectations. 51. The near-term outlook for inflation is also relatively benign vis-a-vis the 2022-23 experience. Beyond the first quarter, however, pressure points emanating from specific supply-demand mismatches could impart upward pressure to the momentum of prices and offset favourable base effects, especially in the second half of 2023-24. Hence, monetary policy needs to remain in \u2018brace\u2019 mode, ensuring that the effects of these shocks dissipate without leaving scars on the economy. 52. Accordingly, my vote for maintaining status quo on the policy rate should be seen as taking middle stump guard to prepare for a bouncier pitch. Holding the rate unchanged should not be interpreted as the interest rate cycle having peaked, but as a period of careful evaluation of a decision on the extent of additional policy tightening, if needed. This is a part of continuous learning about the underlying structure of the economy with new information until the next meeting of the MPC, and not a prolonged pause. Headline inflation is edging down towards the target, but it is still well above it and the balance of risks suggests that it will go up in coming months before it comes down. Therefore, continuing with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation is appropriate as it adequately conveys the future course of interest rates in the economy. Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 53. The global economy has sustained the growth momentum and the overall uncertainty is somewhat receding. Nevertheless, headwinds to global growth outlook persist. The geopolitical conflict continues unabated. Headline inflation across countries is on a downward trajectory, but is still high and above their respective targets. Central banks remain on high alert and watchful of the evolving conditions. 54. India\u2019s macroeconomic fundamentals are strengthening and growth prospects are steadily improving and becoming broad-based. Inflation has eased and the external sector outlook has improved. Balance sheets of banks and corporates look resilient and healthy, thereby engendering twin balance sheet advantage for growth. Demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving rural demand and investment activity. Urban demand remains strong. Consumer and business outlook surveys display continued optimism. Overall, the Indian economy presents a story of resilience and sustainability, with an expected real GDP growth of 6.5 per cent in 2023- 24. Macroeconomic and financial stability is now well entrenched and needs to be nurtured and preserved with well calibrated and timely actions. 55. The inflation trajectory has seen significant softening during March-April 2023, as anticipated, with the near-term outlook turning out to be more favourable than envisaged earlier. Inflation is now projected to average 5.1 per cent in 2023-24 compared to 6.7 per cent in 2022-23, but this would still be above the target. The disinflation towards the target rate of 4 per cent is likely to be gradual and protracted. Compared to April, uncertainties on the inflation outlook for H2:2023-24 have not abated. The spatial and temporal distribution of the south-west monsoon in the backdrop of a likely El Nino weather pattern needs to be watched carefully, especially for its impact on food prices. International prices for key food items like rice and sugar are at elevated levels. Adverse climate events have the potential to quickly change the direction of the inflation trajectory. Geo-political tensions, uncertainty on crude price trajectory and volatile financial markets pose further upside risks to prices. These considerations warrant close monitoring of the evolving price dynamics. The pause in April MPC was based on the need to assess the cumulative impact 56. of 250 bps rate hike over the past one year. Our surveys indicate that anchoring of expectations is underway and our monetary policy actions are yielding the desired results. Given the baseline inflation projections for 2023-24, positive real policy rates will aid the ongoing disinflation process. The full impact of past actions is still unfolding. In this situation, a pause in the rate hike cycle and closely assessing the evolving situation looks the most appropriate option for this meeting of the MPC. Accordingly, I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged in this meeting of the MPC. 57. Our job is only half done, having brought inflation within the target band. Our fight against inflation is not yet over. We need to undertake forward-looking assessment of the evolving inflation-growth outlook and stand ready to act, if situation so warrants. Beyond this and given the prevailing uncertainties, it is difficult to give any definitive forward guidance about our future course of action in a rate tightening cycle. I also vote to continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation, given that 58. liquidity in the banking system is still in surplus and we have a way to go to align headline inflation with 4.0 per cent target on a durable basis and ensure that the overall financial conditions are in sync with the monetary policy stance. We will continue to remain agile and flexible in managing liquidity through two-way operations. We do recognise that durable price and financial stability are mutually reinforcing and necessitate greater policy focus at the current juncture. Our future actions will be shaped accordingly. ", "file2": "The forty fourth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during August 8 to 10, 2023. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve 3. Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (August 10, 2023) decided to: Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent. 6. the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 7. The global economy is slowing and growth trajectories are diverging across regions amidst moderating but above target inflation, tight financial conditions, simmering geopolitical conflicts, and geoeconomic fragmentation. Sovereign bond yields have hardened. The US dollar fell to a 15-month low in mid-July on expectations of an early end to the monetary tightening cycle, although it recouped some of the losses subsequently. Equity markets have gained on expectations of a soft landing for the global economy. For several emerging market economies, weak external demand, elevated debt levels and tight external funding conditions pose risks to their growth prospects. Domestic Economy 8. Domestic economic activity is maintaining resilience. The cumulative south-west monsoon rainfall was the same as the long period average up to August 9, 2023 although the temporal and spatial distribution has been uneven. The total area sown under kharif crops was 0.4 per cent higher than a year ago as on August 4, 2023. The index of industrial production (IIP) expanded by 5.2 per cent in May while core industries output rose by 8.2 per cent in June. Amongst high frequency indicators, e-way bills and toll collections expanded robustly in June-July, while rail freight and port traffic recovered in July after remaining muted in June. The composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose to a 13-year high in July. 9. Urban demand remains robust, with domestic air passenger traffic and household credit exhibiting sustained double digit growth. The growth in passenger vehicle sales has, however, moderated. In the case of rural demand, tractor sales improved in June while two-wheeler sales moderated. Cement production and steel consumption recorded robust growth. Import and production of capital goods continued in expansion mode. Merchandise exports and non-oil non-gold imports remained in contraction territory in June. Services exports posted subdued growth amidst slowing external demand. 10. Headline CPI inflation picked up from 4.3 per cent in May to 4.8 per cent in June, driven largely by food group dynamics on the back of higher prices of vegetables, eggs, meat, fish, cereals, pulses and spices. Fuel inflation softened during May-June, primarily reflecting the fall in kerosene prices. Core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) was steady in June. The daily absorption of liquidity under the LAF averaged \u20b91.8 lakh crore during 11. June-July as compared with \u20b91.7 lakh crore in April-May. Money supply (M3) expanded by 10.6 per cent y-o-y as on July 28, 2023 as against 10.1 per cent on May 19, 2023. Bank credit grew by 14.7 per cent y-o-y as on July 28, 2023 as compared with 15.4 per cent on May 19, 2023. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 601.5 billion as on August 4, 2023. 12. Going forward, the spike in vegetable prices, led by tomatoes, would exert sizeable upside pressures on the near-term headline inflation trajectory. This jump is, however, likely to correct with fresh market arrivals. There has been significant improvement in the progress of the monsoon and kharif sowing in July; however, the impact of the uneven rainfall distribution warrants careful monitoring. Crude oil prices have firmed up amidst production cuts. Manufacturing, services and infrastructure firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys expect input costs to ease but output prices to harden. Taking into account these factors and assuming a normal monsoon, CPI inflation is projected at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24, with Q2 at 6.2 per cent, Q3 at 5.7 per cent and Q4 at 5.2 per cent, with risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2024-25 is projected at 5.2 per cent (Chart 1). Looking ahead, the recovery in kharif sowing and rural incomes, the buoyancy in 13. services and consumer optimism should support household consumption. Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, supply chain normalisation, business optimism and robust government capital expenditure are favourable for a renewal of the capex cycle which is showing signs of getting broad-based. Headwinds from weak global demand, volatility in global financial markets, geopolitical tensions and geoeconomic fragmentation, however, pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent with Q1 at 8.0 per cent; Q2 at 6.5 per cent; Q3 at 6.0 per cent; and Q4 at 5.7 per cent, with risks broadly balanced. Real GDP growth for Q1:2024-25 is projected at 6.6 per cent (Chart 2). 14. The headline inflation is likely to witness a spike in the near months on account of supply disruptions due to adverse weather conditions. It is important to be vigilant about these shocks with a readiness to act appropriately so as to ensure that their effects on the general level of prices do not persist. There are risks from the impact of the skewed south-west monsoon so far, a possible El Ni\u00f1o event and upward pressures on global food prices due to geopolitical hostilities. Domestic economic activity is holding up well, supported by domestic demand in spite of the drag from weak external demand. With the cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC working its way into the economy, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, but with preparedness to undertake policy responses, should the situation so warrant. The MPC will maintain a close vigil on the evolving inflation scenario and remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the target and anchoring inflation expectations. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 15. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. 16. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on August 24, 2023. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during October 4-6, 2023. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent 19. Growth indicators for the first four months of FY 2023-24 point to the resilience of the economy in the face of adverse external economic conditions and the uneven spread of monsoon over the months and spatially across the regions. The headline inflation rate dropped significantly in Q1: FY2023-24 but the headline inflation rate for FY 2023-24 as a whole as projected in the June 2023 MPC meeting was above 5 per cent, highlighting the distance to the policy target of 4 per cent. The policy rate was kept unchanged in the last MPC meeting in view of the need to assess the course of the inflation rate and the economic activity in the context of the increase in the policy rates effected since May 2022. 20. As far as the overall domestic economic activity is concerned, the outlook for the near term appears to be one of lower GDP growth compared to the 7.2 per cent growth rate achieved in FY 2022-23. The outlook for the global economic growth has become more optimistic with the IMF increasing its projection of the world GDP growth in its July update of the World Economic Outlook to 3.0 per cent in 2023 from the earlier projection of 2.8 per cent. However, there are risks of adverse shocks such as the further deterioration of geopolitical conflicts and the adverse climatic conditions affecting agriculture. The same is the case with respect to inflation outlook. Vulnerability to spikes in international commodity and energy prices caused by disruptions in supply chains pose a significant challenge to maintaining domestic price stability. The high frequency indicators of the economic activity reflect growth resilience 21. and the need for a cautious outlook. Merchandise exports and imports including non-oil non-gold imports have registered negative YOY growth rates in the recent months. Services exports are rising but the growth has decelerated. Services imports declined in June. Construction related indicators such as cement production and finished steel production point to sustained growth. Indicators such as E-way bills, GST collection and toll collection suggest sustained expansion in domestic economic activity. But air cargo, rail freight and port traffic show weak trends. The PMI for manufacturing and services for July 2023 re-iterate the resilience of the economy in the face of weak external demand conditions and uncertainties faced over the quality of the monsoon rains this year. However, expectations of the future output are on a cautious note. 22. momentum. The Consumer Confidence Survey of urban households by RBI conducted in July 2023 indicates cautious optimism for the year ahead: the households are optimistic of improved economic conditions one-year ahead and the level of optimism remains stable at the level seen in the survey conducted in May 2023. The increased consumption spending is still driven by the \u2018essential expenditure\u2019 and the \u2018non-essential or discretionary expenditure\u2019 is expected to gain strength in the year ahead, though the optimism declined marginally in the latest round of the survey. The trends in IIP for consumer goods also appear to reflect this pattern: IIP for consumer non-durables has shown significant growth in April-May 2023 and the YOY growth rate of IIP for consumer durables remains negative. Indicators of consumption growth such as passenger vehicle sales, 2-wheeler sales and air travel are higher in April-May 2023 YOY basis, with the performance slowing in June for the auto sector. Maintaining the growth momentum of the agricultural sector seen in the last 2-3 years would be crucial in sustaining rural consumption demand. The indicators related to household consumption expenditure reflect its moderate 23. The impact of the government\u2019s capital expenditure support both at the Central and state levels for infrastructure and support for building production capacity in the industry is reflected in the indicators related to industrial activity. The IIP for infrastructure/ construction is the only sub-sector of industry to register double digit YOY growth during April-May 2023. The IIP for capital goods has also registered growth of 6.5 per cent in the same period but it is a sharp decline from the growth in Q4: FY2022-23. RBI\u2019s survey of enterprises carried out in April-June 2023 reflected increased levels of investment plans for FY 2023-24. The investment intentions reflected in the funds raised for investment purpose in Q1 FY 2023-24 by the private corporates, based on an analysis by RBI, are strikingly high. The net FDI inflows in April- May 2023 at USD 5.5 billion are about half the level seen in the same period in 2022. Maintaining high investment demand would be important for sustaining growth momentum in FY 2023-34. the developments 24. Considering the external global environment, the YOY GDP growth for 2023-24 has been retained at 6.5 per cent, the same as in the June meeting of the MPC. The quarterly growth projections are Q1 at 8.0 per cent, Q2 at 6.5 per cent, Q3 at 6.0 per cent and Q4 at 5.7 per cent. The median forecast of YOY GDP growth for FY 2023-24 from the RBI Survey of Professional Forecasters is 6.1 per cent. in 25. At 4.6 per cent, the CPI based YOY headline inflation rate in Q1: FY2023-24, is below the 6 per cent mark after a run of above 5 per cent for the previous eight quarters. On the positive side, in Q1, the core inflation rate excluding food and fuel, has also come close to 5 per cent. Both food and fuel & light components of headline inflation were below 5 per cent in Q1. 26. The downward momentum of the inflation is complemented by the expectations of moderating inflation. The recent RBI bi-monthly sample survey of urban households indicates that the 3-months and one-year median expected inflation rates are lower than in the previous two consecutive rounds. The \u2018Business Inflation Expectations Survey\u2019 of firms conducted by the IIM Ahmedabad in June 2023 indicates a decline in the one-year- ahead expected CPI headline inflation rate of below 5 per cent. 27. Based on an assessment of the various factors affecting price trends, and an assumption of a normal monsoon, CPI headline inflation is projected at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24, with Q2 at 6.2 per cent, Q3 at 5.7 per cent and Q4 at 5.2 per cent. The projected inflation rate in Q2 and Q3 is now higher than the projections of the June MPC meeting, primarily on account of risks to food inflation. The Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in July 2023 provides median forecast of headline inflation rate of 5.2 per cent in 2023-24. 28. While there is a moderating trend in the headline inflation rate, there are clearly upside risks on account of the weather uncertainty affecting agricultural prices. The international commodity prices have remained low in 2023 relative to the peaks of 2022; however, the volatility has increased for some of the agricultural commodities and there is hardening in the case of energy in the recent period. While the spikes in prices of a few commodities may not lead to persistent overall price pressures, broadening of price pressures would be a concern. The impact of policy rate actions initiated in May 2022 leading to an increase in the repo rate by 250 basis points by February 2023 is yet to be fully realised. There are also risks to growth projections, particularly as they relate to export demand. Therefore, there is a need at this juncture to retain the current policy rate and the policy stance to sustain the moderating forces on inflation. 29. Accordingly, I vote: to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent and to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 30. Since global inflation is moderating without a major impact on growth a soft landing becomes more feasible. But financial fragilities in some countries, erratic weather and geopolitics continue to remain threats. 31. Indian growth also continues to be healthy especially since the rise in fixed investment can raise potential output. There are indications investment is becoming broad-based as state governments and small firms also invest more. It needs to strengthen further, however, for which policy certainty and smoothing of shocks is required. Export dependent industries such as textiles are not doing well. 32. Despite a late start, the monsoon more than made up in July. Precipitation is uneven, however, and extreme weather has caused unprecedented spikes in key vegetable prices. Even as headline inflation rose in June, core inflation stayed soft and professional forecasters expect it to fall below 5%. The pandemic related rise in firm costs has more than reversed. For example, container shipping rates in July were about half their 10 year average rates. Since the Indian middle income consumer is price sensitive, profits have risen for 33. FMCG firms that have passed on the fall in costs. Nominal sales growth of manufacturing companies softened in Q1 according to the early corporate results while real growth rose, pointing to factors limiting price rise. The RBI end June enterprise survey also shows the moderation in input cost is expected to continue in the 2nd half of the year. This should impact pricing. Prices are expected to rise, but by how much? 34. Research suggests that Indian firms change prices about once in three years, so the passing on of cost softening is not yet complete and should continue as long as current supply-shocks reverse. Moreover, for firms that print a maximum retail price on packages, the increase is found to be at around 4%1. This may indicate the inflation target is becoming a focal point. The sectoral structure of inflation also supports softening core inflation. In IT services where share of wage cost is above 50% wage growth is reducing as export demand slows. Wage growth was the highest in this sector in 2022- 23. In manufacturing, raw material cost is the largest share of cost and it has fallen. 35. In the initial period when inflation targeting was introduced, causality was thought to be from headline to core inflation2. Then food inflation could have persistent effects on inflation. But later research showed this result was special to a period of sustained high food inflation that began in 2007 and led to second round rise in wages. In normal conditions, it was the more persistent core that affected volatile food inflation3. Spikes in food prices can therefore be looked through as long as they remain just that. 36. The household inflation expectation and consumer confidence surveys suggest households are doing exactly this looking through, since inflation perceptions have risen but one year ahead inflation expectations have fallen. 37. However, agricultural prices must become more resistant to possibly more frequent weather shocks. For this diversified and resilient vegetable supply chains are required. Well-functioning markets respond before price spikes become very large. Delhi should not be buying tomatoes only from Himachal Pradesh. States can experiment with allowing corporations more direct access to farmer organizations. Large food retail chains also buying from mandies aggravates price movement in India. Farmer cooperatives have more bargaining power and platforms like Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) can aid them in establishing supply agreements anywhere in the country. Processing and storage facilities must improve. In addition to these longer-term actions, trade offers short term degrees of freedom in an open economy. 38. Pre-emptive supply-side action that prevents repeated or persistent food price shocks would abort second round increase in wages and other prices that could require further monetary tightening and growth sacrifice. 1 \u2018Price Stickiness in CPI and its Sensitivity to Demand Shocks in India\u2019, Sujata Kundu, Himani Shekhar and Vimal Kishore, RBI occasional papers, 42(2): 101-147, 2021. 2 \u2018Food Inflation in India: The Role for Monetary Policy\u2019, Anand, R., Ding, D., & Tulin, V., International Monetary Fund, Working Paper Series no.

Slower global growth is likely to keep a lid on international oil prices. Indian oil majors turned profitable in the summer last year and are showing large profits. They are in a position to reduce domestic prices. Oil price cuts have a large impact on household inflation expectations. 40. Commitment to flexible inflation targeting that anchors inflation expectations requires aligning the nominal repo rate with medium term expected inflation. The latter is less affected by transient shocks and measurement issues. Headline inflation forecasts have risen in the short-term but remain slightly above 5% for the next year so that a repo rate of 6.5% still gives a positive real rate of around unity. This is the apt real rate given uncertainties in both growth and inflation. Therefore, in this meeting it continues to be appropriate for the MPC to pause. I 41. thus vote for keeping the repo rate unchanged in this meeting. I also vote for the present stance to continue since at present liquidity is in surplus and policy needs to signal continuing watchfulness towards bringing inflation to the target. The progress of the rest of the monsoon, possible supply-side action, further pass through of past rate hikes, the behaviour of food prices and the evolution of core inflation, have all to be carefully observed. 42. In June, I warned against declaring victory based on the inflation prints of just a couple of months, and expressed discomfort with the self-congratulatory tone of the MPC statement of that month about inflation having come inside the tolerance band. It is now clear that we would have a couple of months of inflation readings well above the tolerance band. I view these monthly gyrations with some degree of equanimity. Just as a couple of low readings do not call for celebration, it is equally true that a couple of very high readings do not call for panic. What is important is the projected trajectory of inflation over the next several quarters. On this basis, I continue to have the same cautious optimism that I had in the June meeting. I expect the continuing slowdown in China to keep a lid on commodity prices. Moreover, rains in July have attenuated the monsoon risks, the spatio-temporal distribution. though 43. Considering the balance of risks, I vote for keeping the repo rate unchanged in this meeting. I am of the view that the current level of the repo rate is high enough to bring inflation below the upper tolerance band on a sustained basis and also glide it towards the middle of the band. 44. Turning to the stance, my reservations remain the same as in the past. However, this would be the third successive meeting at which the repo rate has been left unchanged (assuming that the MPC decides to pause now). This disconnect between stance and action has completely hollowed out whatever meaning the stance might have originally had, and turned it into a harmless ritualism. So I am content with expressing reservations about the stance. 45. In the last minutes, I had mentioned how growth momentum had surprised positively whereas inflation was turning soft, implying a goldilocks kind of scenario. That assessment broadly holds true, albeit with a transitory spurt in inflation. I had highlighted that the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon would be critical for the evolving inflation dynamics. As per the latest available information, this risk has materialised with the uneven progress of the monsoon manifesting in the form of excess rains in the north- west regions and disrupting supply, and deficient rains in the eastern part delaying crop sowing. Vegetables prices rose sharply in June-July \u2013 much above the seasonal trend and the largest in recent memory. 46. High frequency food price data for July indicate a major price shock from vegetables, particularly, tomatoes and this time around it is turning out to be different than earlier episodes. Since mid-June to end-July 2023 tomato prices have surged by 362 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of the price escalation happening during end- June and first half of July. The magnitude and intensity of the price shock this time around was substantially higher when compared to earlier years.4 Our historical experience, however, suggests that the inflationary shocks emanating from commodities like vegetables are in fact transitory in nature. In 2017, when tomato prices soared by 27 per cent in the month of June and further by 138 per cent in July, this was followed by a sharp correction over the subsequent two months. Likewise, in June 2016, the steep increase in tomato prices was fully corrected within the next three months as market supplies improved. Although the catch up in kharif sowing augurs well for agricultural production, price increases observed across other vegetables as well as other food sub- groups such as cereals, pulses and spices remain a point of concern, demanding our vigilant monitoring. The forecast of continuation of uneven monsoon in the next two months together with an El Nino event, amid volatile global food prices, makes the food price outlook uncertain. 47. On the growth front, available information for Q1:2023-24 shows that domestic economic activity has been holding well, on the back of healthy growth in agriculture, rebound in the manufacturing sector, and continued robust expansion in services activity. In the agriculture sector, GVA growth is expected to be above 5.0 per cent on the back of 9.5 per cent growth in rabi foodgrains production.5 Turning to the manufacturing sector, the early listed corporate results of Q1:2023-246 suggest increase in nominal GVA with moderating input cost pressures and double-digit expansion in staff cost. When seen in conjunction with negative deflator-based inflation of around 2.7 per cent and robust unorganised manufacturing activity7, real growth of manufacturing GVA could be over 7.0 per cent in Q1:2023-24. Services activity gained an accelerated momentum in Q4:2022- 23, which seems to have continued in Q1:2023-24. Among services activities, \u2018trade, hotel, transportation, communication\u2019 component was 10.2 per cent below the pre- pandemic levels in Q1:2022-23, suggesting that this sub-group will receive a strong positive base effect in Q1:2023-24. Furthermore, strong momentum of this sub-group from Q4:2022-23 has carried forward to Q1:2023-24 as suggested by available indicators such as e-way bills, toll collections, GST collections etc. Considering all these factors, real GDP growth is expected to be around 8.0 per cent in Q1:2023-24. 48. Looking ahead, the real GDP growth will be driven by strengthening rural consumption on the back of good prospects of kharif crops; the manufacturing sector supported by easing input costs and wide scope for services activity to catch up with pre- 4 By end-July 2023, according to the Department of Consumer Affairs data, the tomato prices were at Rs. 125 per kg. Between end-September and end-November 2021, the peak of tomato prices was Rs. 64 per kg. Between mid-June to end-July 2017 tomato prices increased to touch Rs. 67 per kg. 5 As mentioned in my last statement that around half of rabi production is likely to be accounted for in Q1:2023-24. 6 Private non-financial entities 7 Reflected by index of industrial production (IIP) manufacturing growth of 5.5 per cent in April-May pandemic trend, particularly in \u201ctrade, hotels, transportation, communication, etc.\u201d. Thus, taking all these factors, real GDP growth has been projected at 6.5 per cent for 2023-24. 49. Monetary policy clearly can do little about the first-round effect of a supply side shock emanating from say vegetables. If monetary policy responds to such a surge in headline inflation, the policy would likely be excessively tight and induce high volatility in macroeconomic conditions.8 On the other hand, if these shocks do not go away and become persistent then inflation expectations can become unanchored, leading to a drift in inflation away from its underlying trend. It may be noted that on the earlier two occasions, during mid-2020 and during mid-2021, the MPC\u2019s prognosis of looking through transitory pressures on inflation has in fact proved accurate. 50. Against the balance of risks, I vote for a pause in the rate action. While the impact of our actions so far continues to play out in the economy, our job is not yet fully over. The costs of high inflation regime are simply too high to take any chances (BIS, 2023).9 It is in this context that the primacy of 4 per cent inflation target (as distinct from tolerance of deviation from target) emphasised in my last minutes assumes importance. Accordingly, I vote for the continuance of the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. 51. With the visceral effects of the pandemic fading, the Indian economy is expanding at a moderate pace on the shoulder of the business cycle, and the output gap has closed. Corporate profitability is surging despite moderating top line growth. In the financial sector, credit conditions remain strong even as the cost of funds tightens. The revenge spending related rotation of demand towards services is in full tide, but the peak is subsiding. From the second quarter of 2023-24, unfavourable base effects may create a \u2018wet patch\u2019 in the trajectory of GDP; hence, strengthening the momentum of domestic economic activity is key to realising the projected path of the economy over the rest of the year. 52. Recent spikes in food, metal and energy prices have destabilised the international inflation environment as new spates of geopolitical hostilities take their toll on food and energy security worldwide. In addition, India faces the onslaught of overlapping localised supply shocks, which are causing price-sensitive food items in the CPI to spike and push up headline inflation. The elephant in India is the monsoon, with August shortfalls rendering the outlook uncertain in the shadow of El Ni\u00f1o effects even as Indian Ocean dipole conditions are turning positive. 53. Against this backdrop, recent inflation developments and outlook warrant careful assessment and strategy. Through the current episode, inflation has declined from an average of 7.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2022-23 (peak at 7.8 per cent in April 2022) to 4.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2023-24 (4.8 per cent in June 2023), i.e., by 270 basis points. Monetary policy tightening by a cumulative increase of 250 basis points in the policy rate contributed 130 basis points of disinflation, while the waning of supply shocks contributed 140 basis points and other factors offset each other. At the current juncture, however, the gains in output stabilisation are being threatened by the incidence of sporadic supply shocks which elevate the general level of prices instead of dissipating 8 Frederic S Mishkin (2007), \u2018Headline versus Core Inflation in the Conduct of Monetary Policy\u2019, Remarks at the Business Cycles, International Transmission and Macroeconomic Policies Conference, HEC Montreal, Montreal, 20 October 2007. 9 Bank for International Settlements (2023), Annual Report, June. through relative price adjustments within the budget constraint. Our surveys suggest that households\u2019 inflation perceptions have been impacted by these food price developments \u2013 which is also reflected in consumer perceptions regarding the price level and inflation \u2013 but they should stabilise over the year ahead as supply conditions improve. A risk to the inflation outlook stems from the liquidity overhang in the banking system. Withdrawal of excess liquidity should engage primacy in the attention of the RBI going forward as it presents a direct threat to the RBI/MPC resolve to align India\u2019s inflation with the target, besides the potential risks to financial stability. 54. While unanticipated and short-lived supply demand mismatches lie outside the realm of monetary policy, the commitment to price stability requires the RBI to see off these price perturbations by guarding against spillovers \u2013 in India, food price flares can permeate through wages, rents, transport costs and, importantly, through expectations into core inflation. Ensuring the sustained easing of core inflation is crucial to the MPC\u2019s objective of bringing inflation down to the target. This objective should not be undermined by supply shocks that show any signs of persisting and getting broader-based. Accordingly, I vote for maintaining status quo on the policy rate and for persevering with the withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation. The global economic environment continues to be uncertain. Financial conditions 55. remain tight and volatile. Inflation remains above target in major economies. Amidst all these, India stands out for its resilience and stability and is emerging as the new growth engine of the world. 56. The resilience of Indian economy continued in Q1:2023-24 as reflected in high frequency indicators. The economy is largely evolving on the expected lines. The total acreage under kharif crops has crossed last year\u2019s levels. The manufacturing sector continued to expand, supported by moderating input cost pressures. Services activity remained strong in Q1:2023-24 and it is likely to follow through during the remaining period of 2023-24. 57. Rural consumption has shown signs of improvement in Q1:2023-24 while urban consumption has remained stable. Investment activity is supported by strong government capex. State governments\u2019 capex has also seen a jump.10 The higher government capex and the twin-balance sheet advantage of banks and corporates provide a congenial environment for private sector investments to gather pace. Private investments are already happening in a few critical sectors like iron and steel, automobiles, petroleum, metals and chemicals. These growth drivers are expected to support the real GDP growth projection of 6.5 per cent for 2023-24 and 6.6 per cent for Q1:2024-25. 58. Headline inflation had eased significantly from 6.2 per cent in Q4:2022-23 to 4.3 per cent in May 2023 reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures. Inflationary pressures are, however, emerging again with inflation rising to 4.8 per cent in June on the back of rising food prices. Headline CPI is expected to harden significantly in July-August, driven by the spike in tomato and other vegetable 10 The data available from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) for 20 states indicates that capital expenditure of the states increased sharply by 74.4 per cent during Q1:2023-24 aided by the Union Government's 'Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment'. As on July 25, 2023, the central government has approved expenditure amounting to \u20b984,884 crore accounting for 65.3 per cent of the \u20b91.3 lakh crore budgeted for 2023-24. prices. While the vegetable price shocks are expected to correct quickly with the arrival of fresh crops, there are risks to the food and the overall inflation outlook from El Nino conditions, volatile global food prices and skewed monsoon distribution - all of which warrant close monitoring. In the non-food category, crude oil prices have firmed up reflecting tighter supply conditions. Against this backdrop, supply side measures need to be continued to prevent the spiraling of frequent food supply shocks into generalised economy-wide price impulses. The softening of core inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel) by around 100 bps, from 6.0 per cent in Q4:2022-23 to 5.1 per cent in Q1:2023-24 is a source of some comfort in the face of rising food prices, although it is still at an elevated level. 59. The Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity management has been nimble and two-sided as per requirement. We will manage the liquidity overhang proactively using the various instruments at our command while ensuring that the banking system has adequate liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy. 60. Headline inflation has softened from last year\u2019s elevated level but it still rules above the target. Our task is still not over. Given the likely short-term nature of the vegetable price shocks, monetary policy can look through the first-round impact of fleeting shocks on headline inflation. At the same time, we need to be ready to pre-empt any second-round impact of food price shocks on the broader inflationary pressures and risks to anchoring of inflation expectations. The impact of the cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points on the economy is still playing out. Considering all these aspects, I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent with preparedness to act, should the situation so warrant. Further, as transmission of the repo rate increase of 250 bps to lending and deposit rates is still incomplete, I vote to continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. 61. In this dynamic environment, we remain steadfastly committed to our goal of aligning inflation to the target of 4.0 per cent. We continuously assess the impact of our past actions, the implications of incoming data for the evolving inflation and growth dynamics and stand in readiness to act whenever necessary. ", "file3": "The forty fifth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during October 4 to 6, 2023. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve 3. Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic 5. situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (October 6, 2023) decided to: Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent. The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Global growth is losing momentum. Inflation is easing gradually but remains well 6. above target in major economies. Concerns about higher for longer rates are imparting volatility to global financial markets. Sovereign bond yields have hardened, the US dollar has appreciated, and equity markets have corrected. Emerging market economies (EMEs) are experiencing currency depreciation and volatile capital flows. Real gross domestic product (GDP) posted a growth of 7.8 per cent year-on-year 7. (y-o-y) in Q1:2023-24 (April-June), underpinned by private consumption and investment demand. South-west monsoon rainfall recovered during September and ended 6 per cent 8. below the long period average. The acreage under kharif crops was 0.2 per cent higher than a year ago. The index of industrial production rose by 5.7 per cent in July; core industries output expanded by 12.1 per cent in August. Purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) and other high frequency indicators of the services sector exhibited healthy expansion in August-September. 9. On the demand front, urban consumption is buoyant while rural demand is showing signs of revival. Investment activity is benefitting from public sector capex. Strong growth is seen in steel consumption, cement production as well as in imports and production of capital goods. Merchandise exports and non-oil non-gold imports remained in contraction in August, although the pace of decline eased. Services exports improved in August. 10. CPI headline inflation surged by 2.6 percentage points to 7.4 per cent in July due to spike in vegetable prices, before moderating somewhat in August to 6.8 per cent. Fuel inflation edged up to 4.3 per cent in August. Core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) softened to 4.9 per cent during July-August 2023. 11. As on September 22, 2023, money supply (M3) expanded by 10.8 per cent (y-o-y) and bank credit grew by 15.3 per cent. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 586.9 billion as on September 29, 2023. 12. The near-term inflation outlook is expected to improve on the back of vegetable price correction and the recent reduction in LPG prices. The future trajectory will be conditioned by a number of factors like lower area sown under pulses, dip in reservoir levels, El Ni\u00f1o conditions and volatile global energy and food prices. According to the Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys, manufacturing firms expect higher input cost pressures but marginally lower growth in selling prices in Q3 compared to the previous quarter. Services and infrastructure firms expect a moderation in growth of input costs and selling prices. Taking into account these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24, with Q2 at 6.4 per cent, Q3 at 5.6 per cent and Q4 at 5.2 per cent, with risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2024-25 is projected at 5.2 per cent (Chart 1). 13. Domestic demand conditions are expected to benefit from the sustained buoyancy in services, revival in rural demand, consumer and business optimism, the government\u2019s thrust on capex, and healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates. Headwinds from global factors like geopolitical tensions, volatile financial markets and energy prices, and climate shocks pose risks to the growth outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent, with Q2 at 6.5 per cent, Q3 at 6.0 per cent, and Q4 at 5.7 per cent, with risks evenly balanced. Real GDP growth for Q1:2024-25 is projected at 6.6 per cent (Chart 2). The MPC observed that the unprecedented food price shocks are impinging on 14. the evolving trajectory of inflation and that recurring incidence of such overlapping shocks can impart generalisation and persistence. Accordingly, the MPC resolved to remain on high alert, given the prevailing environment of elevated global food and energy prices and global financial market volatility. While vegetable prices may undergo further correction and core inflation is easing, the MPC noted that headline inflation is ruling above the tolerance band and its alignment with the target is getting interrupted. Hence, monetary policy needs to remain actively disinflationary. Domestic economic activity is holding up well and is expected to be boosted by festive consumption demand, pick up in investment intentions and improving consumer and business outlook. As the cumulative policy repo rate hike of 250 basis points is still working its way through the economy, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting, but with preparedness to undertake appropriate and timely policy actions, should the situation so warrant. The MPC will remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the target and anchoring inflation expectations. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. 15. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. 16. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata focused on withdrawal of Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on October 20, 2023. 16. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata focused on withdrawal of Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. 17. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during December 6-8, 2023. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent The spell of subdued overall price pressures during Q1: FY 2023-24 with the 19. headline CPI inflation at less than 5 per cent, was broken by the spike in the vegetable prices pushing the headline inflation to 7.4 per cent in July and 6.8 per cent in August, respectively. While the sharp increase seen during July-August appears transitory, pressures on the price conditions remain. 20. The uneven distribution of rainfall in the current monsoon period is a source of concern on food prices, with cereals, pulses and spices experiencing double digit price rise from June to August. While the kharif sown area is estimated to be at roughly the same level as in the previous year, area under some of the key crops such as pulses and some of the coarse grains is lower than in the previous year. Trade and supply management policies of the government would moderate the price effects of any supply- demand mismatches but favourable weather for the rabi season would be crucial for keeping food inflation moderate. The non-food segment of the CPI basket registered moderate price rise during 21. July-August. CPI excluding food and fuel (core CPI) registered a rise of 4.9 per cent, YOY basis, in both July and August, down from 5.2 per cent in June. While clothing and footwear, health, education, and personal care & effects registered a price rise of above 5 per cent in August, the vulnerability of the core to shocks in the petroleum fuel prices remains significant as a range of transport services prices would be sensitive to fuel prices. The recent Enterprise surveys by the RBI point to continued input price pressures 22. in Q3 and Q4 in FY 2023-24 and expectations of higher selling prices, particularly in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors as compared to the services sector. The overall business situation is also expected by the sample firms to improve in Q3 and Q4 in the manufacturing sector. The Business Inflation Expectations Survey conducted in July by IIM Ahmedabad indicates a rise in the \u2018one year ahead\u2019 expected cost-based inflation rate. 23. The RBI\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of urban households conducted in September 2023 indicates a decline in median inflation expectations for 3-months ahead and one year-ahead. 24. The RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in September 2023 points to a median forecast of 6.6 per cent headline inflation rate in Q2 followed by lower rates of 5.5 per cent and 5.1 per cent in Q3 and Q4, respectively. The core inflation1 is projected at 4.9 per cent in Q2, followed by 4.7 per cent and 4.6 per cent in Q3 and Q4, respectively. 25. Weak global economic growth and external demand have kept the global price pressures down. The global fuel and energy prices volatility and firming up of some of the food commodity prices are a concern in the short-term, in view of the persistent geopolitical tensions and vulnerability to adverse climate shocks. Financial market volatility has also meant volatile capital flows. 26. Considering these broad trends, CPI headline inflation rate for FY2023-24 is projected at 5.4 per cent, unchanged from the projections in the August MPC minutes. The projections for Q2, Q3 and Q4 are at 6.4, 5.6 and 5.2 per cent, respectively, broadly in line with the August projections. 27. On the growth front, YOY GDP growth in Q1: FY 2023-24 at 7.8 per cent follows sharply higher Q1 growth in the previous two years, reflecting the resilience of growth momentum. However, the growth pattern continues to be uneven across sectors, with the services, which include construction, registering growth rate of 10 per cent while that of industry being lower (4.6 per cent). The GVA from manufacturing, accounting for around 80 per cent of GVA from industry, rose by 4.7 per cent. Within the services, all the major segments registered higher YOY growth rates than the overall growth rate of aggregate GVA. However, one segment, \u2018Trade, hotels, transport and communication\u2019 is yet to reach its GVA level of Q1:2019-20. The official estimate of GDP growth for Q1 came slightly lower than RBI\u2019s projection of 8 per cent. 28. The RBI\u2019s recent enterprise surveys indicate expectations of improved demand conditions in Q2 and subsequent two quarters in FY 2023-24, with relatively higher optimism in the manufacturing sector as compared to services and infrastructure sectors. 29. The divergence in growth performance also reflects demand conditions. On the demand side, investment spending increased at a faster rate than consumption with the external demand being a drag for the overall demand growth. During April-July 2023 period, index of industrial production (IIP) data reflects strong YOY growth of \u2018infrastructure/ construction sector\u2019 (12.2 per cent) and \u2018consumer non-durables\u2019 (6.8 per cent) but weaker growth in \u2018consumer durables\u2019 (-2.7 per cent). 30. The RBI\u2019s recent Consumer Confidence Survey of urban households shows cautious optimism. The broader measure of sentiments used in the survey comprising one-year ahead expectations of general economic conditions, employment scenario and household income, reflects improvement over the current period. However, assessment of the current situation is cautious as the increase in \u2018non-essential expenditure\u2019 is lower both in the current period and one-year ahead as compared to the previous round of the 1 Defined as excluding food and beverages, pan, tobacco and intoxicants and fuel and light. survey. The high inflation in July-August seems to have moderated optimism in the present round of the survey. 31. The recent high frequency indicators of economic activity reflect continuation of the growth trends at an aggregate level. The PMIs for manufacturing and services remained at high levels in July and August although the index fell in the case of services while it rose for manufacturing indicating expectation of expansion in output in the short term. Non-food bank credit, GST collections and domestic and international air passenger traffic registered double digit YOY growth in August and September. The drag is in the external sector: merchandise exports and imports declined YoY basis, through the current financial year, although the extent of decline has moderated in August. Services imports declined YOY basis in July and August with exports growing at a modest 8.4 per cent in August. Slower YOY growth is seen in the case of new launches and sales of housing units in Q1: FY 2023-24 as compared to the previous quarter. 32. The median projection of GDP growth for FY 2023-24 from the RBI\u2019s September 2023 round of Survey of Professional Forecasters is 6.2 per cent, rising marginally by 0.1 percentage point from the forecast in July. 33. Overall, the demand conditions are expected to sustain the growth momentum observed in the August meeting of the MPC, although the concerns emerging from the uncertain global market conditions pose downside risks. The GDP growth projection for FY 2023-24 has been retained at 6.5 per cent, with the quarterly projections for Q2, Q3 and Q4 also remaining the same as in the August meeting. The growth momentum is projected to be sustained in the present financial year 34. despite the erratic distribution of monsoon and the weak external conditions based on more stable domestic demand conditions. The points flagged in the August meeting regarding the global economic conditions and incomplete transmission of the policy rate actions undertaken are still relevant at this juncture. It is necessary to assess the strength of the growth trajectory and inflation outlook in the medium term keeping in view the fact that the projected headline inflation remains above 5 per cent in the final three quarters of the current financial year. i. to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent and ii. to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 36. The global picture continues to be mixed. The interpretation of the Fed\u2019s communication as \u2018higher for longer\u2019 has led to US ten year yields crossing 4.5%, especially as the US fiscal deficit continues to rise. There is fear that firms will be in trouble as they re-finance low interest loans taken during the pandemic. But at the same time the Fed is also saying its actions will be data dependent. Markets should take comfort that rates will not continue to be high regardless of what happens. Chinese excess inventories and deflation are contributing to reducing manufacturing costs in most countries. Global growth is expected to fall in FY24 but a turnaround is possible in FY25. Indian growth trends also continue to be mixed. Some export dependent 37. industries have slowed. Pent-up demand is waning for services but remains robust. Many indicators point towards a revival in private investment post recovery, but some surveys suggest election uncertainty may delay projects. This is unlikely, however, in sectors that are close to full capacity utilization with robust domestic demand. 38. There are some indicators of strong domestic demand. PMIs continue to be high. Confidence has improved for consumers and firms. The current account deficit (CAD) is up from -1.2% of GDP in FY22 to -2% in FY23. This equals the excess of investment over savings. Household physical savings is measured as identical to household physical investment savings in India, so it is the net financial savings that affect the CAD. These are down to 5.1% of GDP in FY23 from around 7% of GDP pre-pandemic. A post pandemic surge in net financial savings did not last and they fell to 7.2% of GDP in FY22. 39. Gross household financial savings remain high, however. It was household financial liabilities that increased from 3.8% of GDP in 2021-22 to 5.8% of GDP in 2022- 23, by a similar 2.1% fall in net financial savings. The rise in financial liabilities implies a rise in household physical investment and shows the interest sensitivity of demand in India, with a youthful population borrowing to acquire assets. In FY23 households shifted towards such borrowing since real rates became positive only towards the end of the year. Pass through to bank deposit rates was more delayed but this is happening now and bank deposits are rising. We need to wait and see if the share of financial savings rises again after post-pandemic disturbances. As investment and income rises, savings also tend to rise. Already in Q4 FY23 net financial savings rose to 7% of GDP from 4% of GDP in Q3 FY23. There are signs of a revival in investment now after more than a decade. Sharp 40. financial tightening in 2011 and 2017 punctured such past revivals and led to persistent slowdowns. So it is important to ensure a sustained and sustainable revival this time. There is no excess lending or an infrastructure boom this time, but a healthy gradual rise. Indian household debt is low by international standards, but a sudden rise can be 41. a concern. It is best to restrain over-enthusiasm in good times and thus avoid a crash. Prudential tightening, such as raising LTV ratios or risk weights, would be preferable to raising policy rates more. There is already some reversal of remissions given in the pandemic times. After the firm-lending based NPAs most banks are trying to increase retail loans. These are secured or based on cash or salary flows. But it will help to make sure lending continues to be risk-based and internal assessments are robust. 42. Despite the large inflation spikes to vegetable and crude oil prices, there is favourable news on inflation. The monsoon is ending near normal, spikes have passed with no second-round effects as core inflation continues to soften. The government is undertaking many supply-side measures to reduce inflation. 43. The headline inflation forecast of 5.4 for FY 24 gives a comfortably positive real repo rate. Therefore I vote for a pause in the repo rate, and also vote for the stance on withdrawal of accommodation in order to signal the MPC\u2019s determination to reach its 4% target. This stance rules out a rate cut. It allows a rise but that will not be required unless there are second round effects from the repeated supply shocks. So far there are no signs of such pass through. The guidance therefore is that future moves will be data- dependent. 44. Liquidity has been tight in the past 2 months so that the weighted average call rate (WACR) has often been above the repo rate. This first happened in end-September 2022 suggesting withdrawal of pandemic \u2013time excess liquidity was adequate. After that the WACR has spent more time at the top than at the bottom of the LAF corridor. Endogenous short term liquidity adjustments at the edges keep the WACR within this band. 45. Since March 31, 2014 average annual growth of broad money was 10%, less than nominal income growth, although reserve money growth varied widely over the pandemic and demonetization periods. Over December 2009 to February 2014, prior to the adoption of inflation targeting, average annual broad money growth was 15.0%. 46. But fine-tuning of liquidity is not as yet adequate to keep the WACR at the MPC mandated repo rate. Moreover, shocks can be so large that short-term liquidity is unable to compensate. Then durable liquidity must be adjusted. OMO purchases or sales that affect durable liquidity may be required depending on liquidity conditions. 47. Research finds that quantity (of money) as well as rates matter in Indian conditions. Both too much and too little liquidity has adverse effects. Liquidity aligned to stance increases the impact of a change in the Repo Rate2. But due to a large informal sector and many financial institutions with no recourse to liquidity windows, large liquidity deficits lead to liquidity hoarding and more leakages3. We have seen as liquidity tightens banks with surplus become reluctant to lend to those with deficits or participate in longer tenor VRRR despite profit opportunities. They prefer using RBI\u2019s overnight windows. Impediments to developing an active overnight inter-bank call money market have to be addressed. 48. Analysts are again concerned about falling interest differentials with the US. But markets seem to understand that Indian macros are relatively more stable today. In September despite a 46 bps rise in US 10 year yields, Indian 10 year G-secs rose only 5 bps. The IMF gave the average spread for emerging markets at 200 bps in 2022. India still exceeded that at 280 bps in September. Despite narrower differentials, ECBs and other debt inflows continue. Even so, they are a small and therefore a manageable share of Indian markets. In addition, index inclusion is around the corner. More than higher Indian rates it is lower country risk, a stable currency and higher expected growth that keeps FPI here. There is the lure of high US risk free rates, but since higher Indian rates cannot compensate for this, the latter are best aligned to the domestic cycle. Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma 49. Since the August meeting, the risks to inflation have increased, but only slightly. First, the official end of season report on the Monsoon confirmed that the rainfall was only 94% of the Long Period Average. This small shortfall coupled with the spatio- temporal dispersion in the rainfall could cause some volatility in food prices. However, the effect is more likely to consist of a few short lived inflation spikes rather than a sustained rise in inflation. The second factor is the indication in recent months of a possible geopolitical realignment of the two largest OPEC+ producers. This has imparted considerable volatility to crude oil prices in recent weeks. A sharp fall in crude prices while the MPC meeting was in progress suggests that a slowing world economy does place a limit on the upswing in crude prices. Therefore, I think that the impact of OPEC+ geopolitics would be limited to slowing the pace of decline in inflation, and is unlikely to cause a reversal of this trajectory. Turning to growth, the outlook has improved modestly because of increasing 50. consumer confidence as indicated in the RBI surveys. This increased confidence must also be seen in the light of household financial savings data released by the RBI in September. The data shows that consumers have incurred financial liabilities and 2 Goyal, Ashima and Deepak Kumar Agarwal. 2020. \u2018Policy Transmission in Indian Money Markets: The role of liquidity\u2019, The Journal of Economic Asymmetries, 21 June e00137 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeca.2019.e00137. 3 Goyal, Ashima and Abhishek Kumar. 2018. \u2018Money and Business Cycle: Evidence from India\u2019. The Journal of Economic Asymmetries. 18. November. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeca.2018.e00105 reduced net financial savings to support consumption. This willingness to consume at the cost of reducing savings is very important because it is household consumption that has been propping up the economy in the face of headwinds from fiscal consolidation, weak external demand and tepid capital investment. It is possible that this consumer confidence could become a self fulfilling prophecy as robust consumption demand stimulates growth, generates income and strengthens household balance sheets. Even if that does not happen, global experience suggests that a debt fuelled consumption boom can last several years before petering out. Either way, the medium term growth outlook looks somewhat stronger than it did during the last meeting, though several headwinds still remain. 51. The changes in the outlooks for both inflation and growth are quite modest, and the real repo rate is already quite high. I, therefore, support the decision to keep repo rate unchanged. In my view, the real interest rate based on projected inflation is high enough to glide inflation towards the target within a reasonable period. 52. As regards the stance, I continue to have the same reservations as in the past. Successive meetings that promise to withdraw accommodation while actually keeping rates unchanged do not enhance the credibility of the MPC. I would much prefer a stance in which words are consistent with the actions. Moreover, at this point of time, the guidance that the market really needs is not about how high the terminal repo rate would be, but about how long the rate would be maintained at a high level. It would therefore be useful for the MPC to communicate its intention to keep real interest rates high enough for as long as is necessary to drive projected inflation close to the 4% target on a sustainable basis. Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan 53. At this juncture, three global trends, among many others, need to be closely watched \u2013 rising crude oil prices, rising US yields and rising US dollar. On the domestic front, the containment of food price pressures, particularly vegetable prices, which is reversing, is an important assumption behind retaining our inflation projection at 5.4 per cent during 2023-24. Core inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel) continued to register further softening to 4.9 per cent. In fact, almost all exclusion and trimmed mean measures of inflation have registered a decline in recent months, a marked change from 2022-23 wherein core inflation remained sticky at highly elevated levels. The sequential saar momentum for core inflation was at 4.5 per cent in August with 3-month moving average below 4 per cent as per data available till August. Threshold diffusion indices4 of CPI also indicate a significant slowdown in the rate of price increases across CPI core in the financial year so far. Sustained deflation in WPI non-food manufactured product inflation is also a comforting factor for core inflation. Moreover, moderation of services inflation to close to 4 per cent continues to be a relief as they tend to be stickier as seen in advanced economies. 54. There was also further progress on anchoring of household inflation expectations with 3-month ahead and 1-year ahead inflation expectations having seen a cumulative decline of 170 bps and 110 bps respectively since September 2022. Important point to note is that the sharp jump in vegetable prices have not deterred anchoring of inflation expectations with relatively less impact of food inflation on persistence of core inflation. But this has to be watched carefully. Going forward, waning of transitory food price shocks, the ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions, improvement in supply 4 Threshold diffusion indices capture the dispersion of price increases in CPI basket beyond the specified seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) thresholds of 4 per cent and 6 per cent. chains, strong supply side intervention by the Government, and likely lower rate of increase in selling prices by firms (as per the RBI enterprise surveys) is expected to moderate inflation to 5.2 per cent in Q4 2023-24 and further to 4.3 per cent in Q4 2024- 25. If these projections hold, the alignment of inflation to the target could be underway. But we need to guard against risks from recurring weather related events and rise in global energy prices. 55. On the growth front, with GDP growth at 7.8 per cent for Q1:2023-24 and our nowcast of around 6.5 per cent for Q2, it seems to be tracking our projection of 6.5 per cent for the full financial year. The third quarter would also be buoyed by festival related demand. On the supply side, manufacturing activity is gaining traction with corporate results in Q2 expected to be aided by strong demand and easing input cost pressures. The negative deflator (around -2.5% for July-August) and base effects will also extend support to the real GVA growth in the manufacturing sector in Q2. PMI future activity index in September signalled elevated level of confidence for manufacturing. Survey results show that optimism on demand for manufacturing goods is high and consumer confidence outlook has also improved significantly. Services sector growth continues to remain robust. 56. Broad-basing of economic activity is also reflected in the data on household savings. Though net financial savings of households moderated to 5.1 per cent of GDP in 2022-23, mainly due to significant rise in financial liabilities of households both from bank and non-bank sources (5.8 per cent of GDP from 3.8 per cent in 2021-22), the gross financial savings increased in absolute terms by 13.9 per cent in 2022-23 over the previous year. Moreover, household borrowings reflect higher spending on real estate, vehicles, consumer goods, among others. This implies that the overall savings of households is expected to hold steady with compositional shift in favour of physical savings.5 This would be growth supportive either through direct addition to gross capital formation or by assisting upturn in private capex. Higher investment and income would reinforce higher savings as we have seen in Q4:2022-23 when the net household financial savings normalised to its long-term average of 7.0 per cent from a low range of 4.0 to 4.6 per cent in the first three quarters of 2022-23. 57. The concerns regarding statistical discrepancy on the expenditure side estimates at 2.8 per cent of GDP for Q1:2023-24 (-3.4 per cent of GDP in Q1:2022-23) are unfounded. This discrepancy varies from negative to positive ranging from -4.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent in the new GDP series during Q1:2011-12 to Q1:2023-24 and it eventually evens out. In the pre-pandemic period (Q1:2011-12 to Q3:2019-20), on an average, the share of discrepancy in GDP was 0.9 per cent, while in the post pandemic period (Q4:2019-20 to Q1:2023-24), it has averaged -0.4 per cent. As per the global practice, the production approach of compiling national accounts statistics (NAS) is considered to be firmer and the NAS presents discrepancy with the expenditure approach of GDP compilation explicitly in its regular releases (Sources and Methods, NSO, 2012), adhering to the recommendations by the system of national accounts (SNA 2008). Nevertheless, there is a need to improve GDP estimates from the expenditure side so that evolving dynamics of demand side components are captured appropriately. 58. Given that inflation expectations are backward looking in emerging markets including India, occurrences of multiple large adverse supply shocks run the risk of a drift in inflation expectations from underlying trend, which could eventually stall the ongoing disinflation process. Such supply shocks are challenging and test the inflation fighting credibility of central banks. Though transitory relative price changes in the economy that may spur temporary bouts of inflation may be looked through, monetary policy also 5 Physical savings data will be released by NSO in end-February 2024. needs to be watchful to see that large and frequent supply side shocks does not trigger generalised increase in prices.6 Past such instances in India, as in 2020, do give credence to MPC\u2019s judgement with regard to optimal response to supply shocks with an objective to anchoring inflation expectations, rather than inflation per se. Besides, the sustained fall in core inflation as mentioned earlier vouches for its transitory nature going ahead. 59. Overall, with growth and inflation broadly moving in anticipated direction, monetary policy needs to hold on while earnestly persevering with disinflationary approach and remaining watchful with readiness to act if the situation demands. This calls for continuation of withdrawal of accommodation stance for monetary policy so as to facilitate further transmission of the cumulative policy repo rate hike of 250 basis points on the economy. Thus, I vote for pause in repo rate and continue with the stated stance. 60. Within the dual mandate given to the MPC by the RBI Act, price stability is accorded primacy. Only when price stability is secured on an enduring basis against all threats to it can attention turn to the objective of growth. Without price stability, growth cannot sustain \u2013 the benefits of expanding GDP and employment will be frittered away by the erosion of purchasing power, hurting those the most that eke out livelihoods just to meet the costs of food, shelter and bare essentials. 61. The fight against inflation in the wake of the war in Ukraine has been arduous and herculean; by comparison, the moderation of inflation from the high reaches to which it had surged in the first quarter of 2022-23 has been grudging and underwhelming. The anchoring of inflation expectations is incomplete and muddied by uncertainty, going by the the underperformance of revenues of businesses relative to their profits. There is also growing evidence that inflation is undermining growth \u2013 people are not increasing discretionary spending in view of high inflation and this is slowing sales growth of corporations. increase 62. As the economy negotiates the rapids of the second and third quarters of 2023- 24, the trajectory of inflation is being buffeted by price shocks related to perishables. Surprisingly, they are producing inordinately high and painful spikes in the headline that are unacceptable from the point of view of the overall welfare of our societies. When headline inflation faces price pressures from perishables like vegetables, the standard operating procedure of monetary policy is to look through the transitory impact of their first round effects and await mean reversion. Increasingly, however, these so-called transitory shocks test our buffers and policy responses, given their unanticipated nature. Moreover, these so-called transitory shocks recur with high intensity and disturbing force. Price pressures accumulate in the inflation formation process, imparting hysteresis to inflation expectations and potentially to actual inflation outcomes. This would be unfortunate at a time when our surveys show that in September 2023, households\u2019 inflation perceptions have fallen by 50 basis points (bps) since July 2023, with expectations of lower price and inflationary pressures across most product groups and categories of respondents. 63. Inflation prints for September and October will need to be monitored carefully to look out for the moderation that our projections anticipate. If we tame inflation durably, we will prepare the ground for a long innings of strong and stable growth. Our projections anticipate that growth will gather positive momentum from the second quarter onwards. Monetary policy can contribute by remaining sufficiently disinflationary without being overly restraining. Accordingly, I vote for maintaining status quo on the policy repo rate and persevering with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation in this meeting of the MPC. 64. Global economic activity is decelerating under the impact of tight financial conditions, though it is proving to be more resilient than expected earlier. Headline inflation is moderating, but it remains above target levels in major economies. Monetary policy settings could remain tighter for longer in major advanced economies. Growth remains uneven in many of these countries. 65. Against the backdrop of this challenging global environment, domestic economic activity in India has exhibited resilience, with growth projected at 6.5 per cent during 2023-24. India is poised to become the new growth engine of the world backed by its strong domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers. The judicious policy mix pursued during the recent years to deal with multiple and unparalleled shocks has fostered economic stability. Balance sheets of banks and corporates are strong and healthy. Construction; financial, real estate and professional services continue to maintain strong performance. The upcoming festival season is expected to give further impetus to households spending. Private sector investment is gathering pace with easing input cost pressures. Consumer outlook surveys have turned more optimistic. Business sentiment among manufacturing, services, and infrastructure companies is also optimistic. Both manufacturing and services PMI readings indicate a healthy expansion in these sectors. The external sector has remained eminently manageable, despite global headwinds. travel and 66. The heightened inflationary pressures during July-August 2023, following the spike in vegetables prices, has once again shown that headline inflation remains vulnerable to recurring and overlapping food price shocks. Adverse weather events \u2013 unseasonal rains, skewed monsoon rainfall and unprecedented heat waves \u2013 have been major sources of food inflation pressures in recent years. Moreover, the intensity of food price shocks triggered by such events has increased, with the month of July registering the highest month-over-month increase in food prices in the current CPI series (2012=100). Such recurring supply side shocks are making episodes of high inflation more than transient. The spike in vegetable prices has likely corrected substantially in September and inflation is expected to fall significantly below the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent. The moderation in inflation in September would also be aided by the sharp reduction in household LPG prices in end-August. The projections suggest that throughout much of Q3:2023-24, food inflation pressures may not see a sustained easing, but ample buffer stocks of food grains, softening edible oil prices, and government\u2019s proactive supply side interventions are expected to keep check on unusual price spikes of key food items. Even as headline inflation experienced considerable volatility, a silver lining has been the declining core inflation, supported by declining cost- push pressures and ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions. 67. Going forward, inflation outlook continues to be beset with uncertainties, especially from adverse weather events, the playout of El Ni\u00f1o conditions, uncertainties in global food and energy prices and volatility in global financial markets. Inflation expectations of households \u2013 both three months and a year ahead \u2013 have, however, moved together to single digit for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. In this situation monetary policy must remain actively disinflationary to ensure that ongoing disinflation process progresses smoothly. 68. Liquidity in the banking system is expected to remain adequate in the coming months to meet the productive requirements of the economy with expected pick-up in government spending, although festival-related currency withdrawals may provide some counterbalance. The Reserve Bank has maintained a flexible and adaptive approach to liquidity management. It will remain nimble footed and ensure that liquidity is actively managed by undertaking whatever operations are necessary from time to time, including open market operation sales (OMO-sales). Needless to state, the timing and quantum of such operations will depend on the evolving liquidity conditions. 69. To sum up, domestic economic growth is maintaining the momentum. Our fundamental goal is to align inflation with the 4.0 per cent target and anchor inflation expectations. Recurring incidences of large and overlapping supply side shocks bring with them the risks of generalisation of inflation impulses, possible loss of monetary policy credibility and de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Monetary policy has to remain extra alert and ready to act, if the situation warrants. The hard earned macroeconomic stability has to be preserved. Accordingly, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged in this meeting of the MPC and continuing the focus on withdrawal of accommodation. ", "file4": "The forty sixth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during December 6 to 8, 2023. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary 2. Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 8, 2023) decided to: Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent. The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. 6. Global growth is slowing at a divergent pace across economies. Inflation continues to ebb though it remains above target with underlying inflationary pressures staying relatively stubborn. Market sentiments have improved since the last MPC meeting \u2013 sovereign bond yields have declined, the US dollar has depreciated, and global equity markets have strengthened. Emerging market economies (EMEs) continue to face volatile capital flows. 7. Domestic economic activity is exhibiting resilience. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew year-on-year (y-o-y) by 7.6 per cent in Q2:2023-24, underpinned by robust investment and government consumption, which cushioned the drag from net external demand. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) rose by 7.4 per cent in Q2, driven by buoyant manufacturing and construction activities. Continued strengthening of manufacturing activity, buoyancy in construction, and 8. gradual recovery in the rural sector are expected to brighten the prospects of household consumption. Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, supply chain normalisation, improving business optimism, and rise in public and private capex should bolster investment going forward. With improvement in exports, the drag from external demand is expected to moderate. Headwinds from the geopolitical turmoil, volatility in international financial markets and geoeconomic fragmentation pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 7.0 per cent with Q3 at 6.5 per cent; and Q4 at 6.0 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2024-25 is projected at 6.7 per cent; Q2 at 6.5 per cent; and Q3 at 6.4 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. 9. CPI headline inflation fell by about 2 percentage points since the last meeting of the MPC to 4.9 per cent in October 2023 on sharp correction in prices of certain vegetables, deflation in fuel and a broad-based moderation in core inflation (CPI inflation excluding food and fuel). 10. Uncertainties in food prices along with unfavourable base effects are likely to lead to a pick-up in headline inflation in November-December. Kharif harvest arrivals and progress in rabi sowing together with El Ni\u00f1o weather conditions need to be monitored. Adequate buffer stocks for cereals and a sharp moderation in international food prices, along with pro-active supply side interventions by the Government may keep these food price pressures under check. Crude oil prices may remain volatile. Early results from the firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys indicate softer growth in input costs and selling prices for the manufacturing firms in Q4 relative to the previous quarter, while price pressures persist for services and infrastructure firms. Taking into account these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24, with Q3 at 5.6 per cent; and Q4 at 5.2 per cent. Assuming a normal monsoon next year, CPI inflation for Q1:2024-25 is projected at 5.2 per cent; Q2 at 4.0 per cent; and Q3 at 4.7 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly balanced. 11. The MPC observed that recurring food price shocks are impeding the ongoing disinflation process. Core disinflation has been steady, indicative of the impact of past monetary policy actions. Headline inflation, however, remains volatile, with possible implications for the anchoring of expectations. Domestic food inflation unpredictability, and volatility in crude oil prices and financial markets in an uncertain international environment pose risks to the inflation outlook. The path of disinflation needs to be sustained. The MPC will carefully monitor any signs of generalisation of food price pressures which can fritter away the gains in easing of core inflation. On the growth front, improved momentum in investment demand along with business and consumer optimism, would support domestic economic activity and ease supply constraints. As the cumulative policy repo rate hike is still working its way through the economy, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting, but with preparedness to undertake appropriate and timely policy actions, should the situation so warrant. Monetary policy must continue to be actively disinflationary to ensure anchoring of inflation expectations and fuller transmission. The MPC will remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the target. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. 12. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. 13. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata focused on withdrawal of Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on December 22, 2023. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 6-8, 2024. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent 16. The official GDP growth estimate for Q2: 2023-24, YOY basis, turned out to be surprisingly strong at 7.6%, following the growth of 7.8 per cent in Q1. The projected GDP growth for Q2 in the October 2023 MPC meeting was 6.5 per cent, well below the NSO estimates. Manufacturing and construction sectors recorded double digit growth rates of GVA in Q2 offsetting the weak growth in agriculture & allied sectors and services. The QOQ momentum in Q2 in the manufacturing and construction sectors, two drivers of GVA growth, was above their decadal average (2011-12 to 2019-20) for the quarter, pointing to the significant growth momentum in these sectors. 17. Although greater optimism in terms of output demand conditions or business turnover for Q2 by the manufacturing firms relative to the service sector firms was reflected in the RBI\u2019s sample surveys of firms conducted during July-September, the actual growth in GVA in manufacturing has exceeded the expectations. At the aggregate level, GDP growth was in sync with some of the indicators of broader economic activity, such as PMI, non-food credit, GST collections and toll collections. Financial performance of the corporate sector for Q2 indicates improved profit earnings and spending on fixed assets in line with the overall GVA growth and the rise in gross fixed capital formation. We may also note that sharp increase in GVA in manufacturing in Q2 is in contrast to the stable overall capacity utilisation rates for the sector indicating the likely significant improvements in revenue realisations and cost efficiency in the present context. 18. The growth momentum while strong, it points to a few concerns as we go forward. Uneven performance, both on the production and demand fronts is evident. On the production side, the agriculture & allied sector and services registered low and modest rates of growth in Q2. The IIP for consumer durables has shown weak growth. On the demand side, real Private Final Consumption Expenditure registered modest 3.1% YOY growth as compared to 11% growth in real Gross Fixed Capital Formation. The November 2023 round of RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey shows improvement in total consumer expenditure over the previous round, both on current period and one-year ahead basis. In the recent few rounds of the survey, the year ahead outlook has been marked by consistently positive net response rates on non-essential spending. On the external demand, the recent projections for global output growth in 2024 by IMF (October 2023) are slightly lower than in 2023 but expect world trade volumes to improve significantly. Sustained growth in fixed capital formation may also require maintaining the pace of government capital outlay. 19. Taking into account both the positive drivers of growth and vulnerabilities, the GDP growth projections for the remaining two quarters of 2023-24 are at 6.5 for Q3 and 6.0 per cent for Q4, taking the projections for FY 2023-24 to 7.0 per cent over the previous year. The projected growth for H2: 2023-24 is 6.3 per cent compared to 5.9 per cent for the same period in our October 2023 assessment. The projected GDP growth rates for the first three quarters of 2024-25 are 6.7, 6.5 and 6.4 per cent. The headline inflation dropped to 5 per cent or lower in September (5%) and 20. October (4.9%). Among the three major constituents \u2013 food, fuel and core \u2013 only food inflation remained above 6% in September and October. CPI Food inflation has remained above 6% since July this year, although pace of the increase has declined. Within the food & beverages category of consumption, cereals, pulses and spices registered double digit percentage price rise YOY basis in October. CPI for Eggs, milk and fruits rose by more than 6 per cent in October. Impact of the unfavourable rainfall conditions during the monsoon season this year has meant likelihood of weak kharif harvest for some of the main crops with implications to food inflation. 21. The weak global demand conditions have kept the commodity and energy prices in the international markets in check. However, continued geopolitical conflicts cast a shadow on supply chains with potential to disrupt global energy and commodity markets and inflation trends. The increased pace of economic activity in the last two quarters, driven mainly by investment spending has not led to rise in core inflation. Supply side policy measures by the government, particularly in the case of food commodities have also helped in reducing the price impact of supply shocks. Inflation expectations survey of urban households conducted by RBI points to the 22. sustained decline in 3 month-ahead inflation expectation since September 2022 up to November 2023, barring a spike in January 2023. The one year-ahead expected inflation rate has moved up marginally in the November round of the survey after following a declining trajectory since September 2022. 23. While the core CPI inflation rate (excluding food and fuel components) fell below 5% in Q2: 2023-24 and dropped to 4.3% in October, price pressures in the non-farm sectors are vulnerable to shocks to input costs. Early results of RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys conducted during the latter part of October and November point to some divergence in the expectations of cost pressures and selling prices between manufacturing and other firms. Larger proportion of sampled manufacturing firms indicate expectations of softening of selling prices in Q4 relative to this proportion in Q3 but larger proportion of firms in the services and infrastructure sectors expect the selling prices to rise in the same period. The inflation expectations survey of business sector conducted by the IIMA in October 2023 points to a slight increase in one year-ahead \u2018unit cost based inflation\u2019 from 4.39% in September 2023 to 4.44% in October 20231. The most recent RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters projects headline 24. inflation rate for Q3: 2023-24 till Q1: 2024-25 declining from 5.4 per cent to 5.2 per cent and dropping to 3.9 per cent in Q2: 2024-25. The core inflation (CPI excluding items of Food, Pan, Tobacco and Intoxicants and Fuel & Light) is projected to drop from 4.3 per cent in Q3: 2023-24 to 4.1 per cent in Q1: 2024-25 but increase to 4.4 per cent in Q2: 2024-25. 25. Considering a range of factors influencing the inflation pattern in the short-term, the headline inflation is projected at 5.6% and 5.2% in Q3 and Q4: 2023-24, respectively, and 5.2% in Q1: 2024-25 followed by 4% in Q2 and 4.7% in Q3. 26. Overall, the economy presently reflects the impact of strong drivers for growth despite the unfavourable conditions in some respects. As noted earlier, adverse monsoon rainfall conditions, especially distribution of rainfall over the monsoon period and across the regions, have meant slower growth of agricultural output and rural demand. The weak external demand conditions have affected the export sector. The uneven feature of growth points to vulnerabilities. While investment has fuelled growth in demand, private consumption demand has grown much more slowly. One reason for the slower growth in consumption relates to the \u2018base effects\u2019 in H1 given the on-going \u2018catch up\u2019 overcoming the pandemic shock. But the uneven sectoral growth patterns also point to other factors influencing output noted earlier with respect to agriculture and external demand. Inflation has moderated in the context of the continued pressure the cumulative 27. monetary policy actions as well as supply side measures by the government in crucial consumption sectors have exerted. The weak external demand conditions have also meant favourable input prices in the international markets. However, food inflation is a concern in the short term. There remain significant risks of the impact of the on-going geopolitical conflicts on particularly fuel prices and consequently on both fuel and core inflation rates. 28. Given that inflation remains well above the target over the short term, with the projected headline CPI rate of above 5% up to Q1: 2024-25, there is a need to continue the policy support for sustaining the trajectory to the target. i) to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and ii) to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 30. There are more signs that global interest rates may have peaked. Fears that rates may be higher for longer have also faded as the US Fed has recognized that rates are restrictive already and becoming more so as inflation falls. Pointing to the 1970s to justify higher rates is not valid since inflation has not been high for as long as it was then and expectations remain anchored. International oil prices have also softened despite cartel action. But geopolitics continues to remain a threat. 31. Moreover, recent experience has underlined the freedom Indian rate setters have from international rates. Debt and equity inflows returned as rate differentials narrowed. 32. Indian growth has exceeded expectations again. Manufacturing performance is strong. There are more indications of the expected turnaround in private investment. While cement and steel production have been robust for long, IIP and imports of capital goods, banks\u2019 project finance, firms\u2019 investment intentions and fixed assets have also risen. Rising cash and reserves makes firms less dependent on household savings for financing. 33. The recent state election results reduce uncertainty around national elections and policy so more investment plans should be fast-tracked. But areas of weakness remain in consumption, IT and merchandise exports. Employment offers have slowed in IITs. 34. The centre has demonstrated commitment to fiscal consolidation in terms of sticking to the announced path of deficit reduction, higher share of spending on investment and discipline on off-budget items. Buoyant revenues are able to absorb a large post-pandemic subsidy burden. As countercyclical macroeconomic policy smooth\u2019s shocks and delivers a real interest rate less than the real growth rate, the denominator rises, reducing debt and deficit ratios2. 35. Headline inflation is expected to be within the tolerance band at 5.4% in FY24 and to fall to 4% in Q2 FY25 but rise to 4.7 in Q3. Core inflation shows a broad based moderation falling from 6.1 in 2022-23 to 4.8 in Q2 FY24. Professional forecaster\u2019s figure for core inflation in Q3 is at 4.4%. There is a view that stronger growth will raise core inflation. But even with real 36. GDP growth at 7% it does not necessarily imply potential output is reached implying excess demand and pressures on core inflation if reforms are raising structural growth. 37. Some research defines potential output in terms of expected inflation, and this is a forward-looking way to estimate it given India\u2019s large underemployed population and rising investment\u2014output is below potential if core inflation is below acceptable upper limits3. Time series methods of estimating potential output are backward-looking, with too much weight on recent growth. 38. Why has core inflation come in lower than expectations even as growth recovered? 39. price shocks since Indian labour markets are slack. There were no second round effects raising wages from the earlier commodity 40. Currently, falling costs and healthy sales have raised profits, despite factors that are restraining demand in India. Some firms have reversed earlier price increases that passed on higher costs. Higher sales help spread costs. Many firms had restructured during the pandemic to reduce costs. There is evidence that the mark-up on costs is countercyclical4. Lower price and higher volumes is a strategy that delivers profits in India. Moreover, FMCG majors face competition in 2 and 3 tier markets from many new regional entrants. Investment is expanding capacity so that utilization has not increased despite 41. good output growth. There is evidence that firm\u2019s inflation expectations are well-anchored around 4%5. 43. spikes as well as improve capacities in the long-run. The government continues to take supply-side action to moderate short term price 2 Goyal, A. 2023. 'Indian Fiscal Policy: A possible escape route.' IGIDR Working Paper no. WP-2023-010.

Indian oil majors are profitable again despite recent volatility in oil prices and will be able to pass on benefits to consumers if international oil prices fall sustainably below USD 80 per barrel. Current trends are towards this. 45. All this continues to reduce costs for firms. In these circumstances, core inflation should continue to converge towards 4% and headline should converge to a stable core despite any further transient supply shocks. New data affects outcomes within a structure. It is necessary to pay attention to the structure and context. If inflation sustainably approaches 4% by the middle of 2024 real rates can easily 46. become too high if nothing is done. A repo of 6.5% in 2018 and tight liquidity with a headline inflation of around 4%, even though core inflation was around 6%, proved severely deflationary. Both headline and core inflation fell steeply over the next year. 47. In this meeting, however, I vote for keeping the repo rate and the stance unchanged, in order to watch the impact of an expected rise in food inflation over the next couple of months, since repeated supply shocks are a concern. Even so, as yet they have not been able to raise inflation expectations or reverse the decline in core inflation. 48. Despite the stance, I expect the weighted average call rate (WACR) to ease away from the upper end of the LAF corridor towards the repo rate as government cash balances are drawn down and measures are taken to reduce liquidity hoarding by banks. Under inflation targeting, liquidity is endogenous and is expected to adjust to keep short rates near the repo rate set by the MPC. The RBI had clarified6 post inflation targeting that its \u2018operating procedure aims at modulating liquidity conditions so as to achieve the operating target, i.e., to anchor the WACR around the policy rate\u2019 and \u2018MSF rate and the fixed overnight reverse repo rate define an informal corridor for limiting intra-day variations in the call rate.\u2019 Understanding this should alleviate the markets concern that liquidity can suddenly dry up. While under the current stance WACR may stay largely in the upper half of the LAF corridor, it cannot persistently exceed it. 49. Pass-through continues as old deposits and loans are re-priced, but the stance, as well as credit growth continuing to exceed deposit growth, should persuade banks of the virtues of passing through more of the 250bps repo rate rise to increase their primary liquidity. 50. Current the economic environment is turning more benign in terms of both inflation and growth. The challenge for monetary policy is to facilitate this benign outcome where inflation trends down and growth remains robust. This requires two things. First, a restrictive monetary policy must be maintained 51. long enough to glide inflation to its target of 4%. Second, as inflation drops well below the upper tolerance band, it is necessary to prevent the real interest rate from becoming excessive. At present, projected inflation two to four quarters ahead averages below 4.75%. The prevailing money market interest rates of 6.75% (close to the MSF rate) therefore represent a real interest rate of more than 2%. Three years of high inflation do indications are justify a strong anti-inflationary monetary policy, but in my view a real rate of 2% clearly exceeds the optimal rate. In coming months, as we become more confident about the downward trajectory of inflation (apart from transient food price spikes), there would be a compelling case for continually calibrating the nominal policy rate so as to keep the real interest rate slightly below 1.5% (on the basis of projected inflation 3-5 quarters ahead). 52. For these reasons, I vote for maintaining the repo rate at 6.50%, but express my reservations on the stance. I believe that a stance is not needed at all at this stage. If at all there is a stance, it should be neutral. 53. I began my October statement with three global trends to be closely watched \u2013 crude oil prices, US yields and US dollar, all of which were rising then. Oil prices have decreased, yields have softened, and the US dollar has weakened since the last policy. Thus, we draw comfort from the reversal of these trends in this December policy. In addition, global commodity prices have eased further. The impact of these dynamics is seen globally in terms of faster than expected decline in inflation of advanced countries and the conjecture that the apprehension of \u2018higher for longer\u2019 may not last long. Domestically, improvement in manufacturing profit with easing of input cost pressures and decline in core inflation is clearly observed. Thus, despite continuing overall global in advance and emerging market uncertainty, economies has not been adversely impacted to the same extent as it was expected, not a long time ago. In fact, the global economy seems to have dodged a hard landing, though it continues to remain vulnerable to slow down risks. the macroeconomic environment 54. Since the last policy, we are in a relatively firmer footing on our domestic macros in terms of inflation and growth. The moderation in CPI to 4.9 per cent in October 2023 was driven by the fall in food and core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation along with deflation in the fuel group. Since September, core disinflation also gathered pace, softening by about 60 basis point in a span of two months to 4.3 per cent in October or by about 2 percentage points from a peak value of 6.2 per cent in January.7 Even within core, services inflation at 3.6 per cent was at the lowest level since the start of the 2012=100 series. Core goods inflation, from a peak of 7.1 per cent in February 2023 has since then sequentially moderated to 5.0 per cent in October. Various exclusion based and statistical trimmed mean measures of core inflation also softened in the range of 60- 120 bps between August and October. Going forward, core inflation pressure could remain muted, as our monetary policy actions play out and softer growth in input costs and selling prices of the manufacturing sector keep price pressures contained. Concerns on elevated food inflation, however, is a major source of uncertainty for the inflation outlook. 55. On the growth front, the economy is running at full steam. Growth has been resilient and continuously surprising us on the upside over last two releases. The seasonally adjusted momentum in Q2 at 4.3 per cent was stronger than Q2 last year (3.2 per cent) and the pre-COVID average for Q2 (1.6 per cent). This momentum is likely to continue in Q3 and Q4 of 2023-24. It is important to note that for the first time in Q2:2023-24, the fault lines in India\u2019s growth story since the pandemic \u2013 tepid private investment and rural demand \u2013 seem to be gaining traction. This augurs well for the long-term growth trend, particularly, investment plays a larger role in terms of supply augmentation and improving potential growth in the medium to long-term. India has successfully accumulated capital stock over the past decades and continues to invest in capital formation, led by Government capital expenditure, as reflected in the recent GDP data release. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), a proxy for investments, increased by 11 per cent in Q2. We are also in an advantageous position in terms of contribution to potential output through labour and total factor productivity (TFP) channels. India is in the forefront of technology-aided digitalisation with increasing internet penetration and mobile phone usage.8 Greater formalisation and digitalisation of our economy is giving a boost to TFP growth. With respect to human capital, India has a perceptible advantage in terms of demographic dividend and the economy could benefit from it.9 Taken together, capital and TFP, along with favourable demographic dividends, could have led to a sustainable increase in the potential level of output of the economy. This change in structural features of the economy could explain to a large extent the observed dynamics of robust growth numbers along with falling core inflation. The best way monetary policy can support this high growth trajectory is by 56. maintaining its commitment to price stability. While monetary policy has succeeded in getting headline inflation into the tolerance band, it is still above the target10 and continues to remain vulnerable to supply shocks. The below 5 per cent print in October 2023 may reverse as early as next month. In essence, while a durable growth path backed by consumption and investment is visible from here on, the same cannot be said about disinflation yet. Hence, monetary policy must continue treading a cautious path and remain prudent in its approach. We need to continue with the pause on the policy rate in this meeting while observing every incoming information impacting growth- inflation dynamics. Given that inflation remains above target, our stance of withdrawal of accommodation also has to continue to aid fuller transmission. Having taken a pause during the last few policies, there could be an argument for a change in stance to neutral. I feel this is not the right time. Apart from being premature, a change to neutral stance may have to bear the brunt of the collateral damage caused by wrong signalling, particularly with looming uncertainties on the horizon and when market expectations are running ahead of policy intent. We need to consolidate the gains achieved so far. Accordingly, I vote for a pause on rate and continue with the stance. Inflation remains highly vulnerable to food price spikes, as the spurt in momentum 57. in daily data on key food items for the month of November and early December reveal. This repetitive incidence is causing the accumulation of price pressures in the system and could impart persistence, reflected in a left-tailed skew in the distribution of inflation. Households are already wary: although they expect inflation to remain unchanged three months ahead, they are more unsure about this prognosis than they were two months ago. Over the year ahead, however, they are more sure than in the past that inflation will likely rise. Consumers too reveal more pessimism about inflation a year ahead than when they were surveyed in September. Consequently, monetary policy has to remain on high alert with a restrictive stance. 58. In my view, food prices in India are the true underlying component of inflation. They also generate non-trivial external effects that affect other components of inflation as well as expectations. When these spillovers occur and are significant, monetary policy has to pre-emptively act to prevent generalization, irrespective of the fact that the initial shocks emanate from outside the realm of its influence. Hence the stance of withdrawing accommodation and a readiness to take appropriate action must continue until their impact is seen off without second order effects. The recent GDP data release reinforces the view that the output gap in India has 59. turned positive since the beginning of the year and remains so. This points to the likelihood of demand pull shaping the course of inflation outcomes in the period ahead, amplifying future supply shocks. Over the rest of the year, rising momentum of activity will drive growth offset by waning of favourable base effects. Rural demand is gradually improving while urban demand remains ebullient. Investment has emerged as the mainstay of aggregate demand. It remains to be seen if the recent upturn in exports of merchandise sustains. The strength of underlying domestic demand is also being reflected in the pick-up in non-oil non-gold imports after a prolonged contraction. 60. Against this backdrop, the monetary policy reaction function needs to assign a higher weight to inflation relative to growth in a forward-looking sense. Accordingly, I vote to maintain status quo on the policy rate and continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. The years 2020 to 2023 will perhaps go down in history as a period of \u2018Great 61. Volatility\u2019. In this environment, the Indian economy presents a picture of resilience and momentum as reflected in the higher than anticipated GDP growth in Q2:2023-24, surprising everyone on the upside. Reflecting this, our growth projection for the current year has been revised upward to 7 per cent. We expect this growth momentum to continue next year also. The softening of headline inflation to 4.9 per cent in October 2023 gives further 62. credence to the fact that the heightened and generalised inflation pressures seen in the summer of 2022 is behind us. This disinflation is underpinned by steady moderation in CPI core inflation, caused by easing of price momentum across core goods and services. Core inflation in October was the lowest since early 2020 and would show that our monetary policy actions are working. 63. Moving forward, while food inflation has receded from the highs seen in July, it remains elevated. The overall inflation outlook is expected to be clouded by volatile and uncertain food prices and intermittent weather shocks. In the immediate months of November and December, a resurgence of vegetable price inflation is likely to push up food and headline inflation. We have to remain highly alert to any signs of generalisation of price impulses that may derail the ongoing process of disinflation. 64. GDP growth is expected to remain resilient. Financial conditions are stable. Inflation is moderating, but we are still quite a distance away from our goal of reaching 4 per cent CPI on a durable basis. The projected inflation (4.7 per cent) in Q3 of next year, i.e., one year from now, is perilously close to 5 per cent. In these circumstances, monetary policy has to be actively disinflationary. Any shift in policy stance now would be premature and risky. Further, with past rate hikes still working through the economy, it would be desirable to closely monitor their full play out. The conditions ahead could be fickle and call for prudent evaluation of the emerging situation. Considering all the above factors, a pause in rate action and remaining focused on withdrawal of accommodation is considered necessary in this meeting of the MPC. Accordingly, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continuing with focus on withdrawal of accommodation. We have to remain vigilant and ready to act effectively in our journey towards 4 per cent inflation target. ", "file5": "The forty seventh meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during February 6 to 8, 2024. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (February 8, 2024) decided to: Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. 6. Global growth is likely to remain steady in 2024 after a surprisingly resilient performance in a turbulent year gone by. Inflation is edging down from multi-decade highs, with intermittent upticks. Financial market sentiments have been fluctuating with changing views about an early pivot by central banks in advanced economies (AEs). The likelihood of lower interest rates has spurred rallies in equity markets, although uncertainty about the timing of interest rate reduction is reflected in bidirectional movements in the US dollar and sovereign bond yields. Emerging market economies (EMEs) are facing currency fluctuations amidst volatile capital flows. 7. Domestic economic activity is strengthening. As per the first advance estimates (FAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), real gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to grow by 7.3 per cent, year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2023-24, underpinned by strong investment activity. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) expanded by 6.9 per cent in 2023-24, with manufacturing and services sectors as the key drivers. 8. Looking ahead, recovery in rabi sowing, sustained profitability in manufacturing and underlying resilience of services should support economic activity in 2024-25. Among the key drivers on demand side, household consumption is expected to improve, while prospects of fixed investment remain bright owing to upturn in the private capex cycle, improved business sentiments, healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates; and government\u2019s continued thrust on capital expenditure. Improving outlook for global trade and rising integration in global supply chain will support net external demand. Headwinds from geopolitical tensions, volatility in international financial markets and geoeconomic fragmentation, however, pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2024-25 is projected at 7.0 per cent with Q1 at 7.2 per cent; Q2 at 6.8 per cent; Q3 at 7.0 per cent; and Q4 at 6.9 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. 9. From its October 2023 trough of 4.9 per cent, CPI inflation increased successively in the next two months to 5.7 per cent by December. Food inflation, primarily y-o-y vegetable price increases, drove the pick-up in headline inflation, even as deflation in fuel deepened. Core inflation (CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) softened to a four- year low of 3.8 per cent in December. 10. Going forward, the inflation trajectory would be shaped by the evolving food inflation outlook. Rabi sowing has surpassed last year\u2019s level. The usual seasonal correction in vegetable prices is continuing, though unevenly. Yet considerable uncertainty prevails on the food price outlook from the possibility of adverse weather events. Effective supply side responses may keep food price pressures under check. The continuing pass- through of monetary policy actions and stance is keeping core inflation muted. Crude oil prices, however, remain volatile. Manufacturing firms covered in the Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys expect some softening in the growth of input costs and selling prices in Q4:2023-24, while services and infrastructure firms expect higher input cost pressures and growth in selling prices. Taking into account these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24 with Q4 at 5.0 per cent. Assuming a normal monsoon next year, CPI inflation for 2024-25 is projected at 4.5 per cent with Q1 at 5.0 per cent; Q2 at 4.0 per cent; Q3 at 4.6 per cent; and Q4 at 4.7 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly balanced. 11. The MPC noted that domestic economic activity is holding up well and is expected to be backed by the momentum in investment demand, optimistic business sentiments and rising consumer confidence. On the inflation front, large and repetitive food price shocks are interrupting the pace of disinflation that is led by the moderation of core inflation. Geopolitical events and their impact on supply chains, and volatility in international financial markets and commodity prices are key sources of upside risks to inflation. The cumulative effect of policy repo rate increases is still working its way through the economy. The MPC will carefully monitor any signs of generalisation of food price pressures to non-food prices which can fritter away the gains in the easing of core inflation. As the path of disinflation needs to be sustained, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting. Monetary policy must continue to be actively disinflationary to ensure anchoring of inflation expectations and fuller transmission. The MPC will remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the target. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. 12. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. 13. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted for a change in stance to neutral. to remain 14. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on February 22, 2024. 15. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during April 3 to 5, 2024. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent 16. The First Advance Estimates of GDP for FY 2023-24 released by the National Statistical Office placed year-on-year real GDP growth for FY 2023-24 at 7.3 per cent, exceeding the 7.2 per cent in the previous year. The implicit growth rate of GDP for the second half of 2023-24 at 7 per cent, is well above the projections in the December 2023 MPC meeting. There has been no slow down in growth in FY 2023-24 despite the adverse monsoon conditions affecting agriculture, weak external demand conditions, risks to the global supply chains due to the geopolitical conflicts and elevated policy interest rates during much of the financial year. Moderation in consumer level inflation rate, decline in commodity prices in the international markets impacting input costs for the domestic producers, and increased pace of government capex spending have offset the impact of adverse growth conditions. The recent broader high frequency indicators of economic activity such as non-food credit, PMIs for manufacturing and services, GST collections point to strong demand conditions. 17. While the growth experience has not been evenly shared across output sectors and across sources of demand, broader supportive economic and monetary policies have helped in sustaining the growth drivers. Going forward, revival of growth in consumption demand would be the key factor in sustaining the current growth momentum, which in turn would require improved employment and household income conditions. 18. In the short-term, the RBI\u2019s sample surveys of urban households conducted during Jan 2-11, 2024 show that consumer confidence is improving on the back of consumer\u2019s assessment of general economic situation and household employment, and high household income in comparison to the findings of the previous round of the survey. The consumer optimism is accompanied by caution as the survey indicates that the expectation of increase in overall spending - i.e., the percentage of respondents expecting increased spending - is yet to reach levels of pre-pandemic period. The gap is particularly substantial in the case of discretionary spending. 19. The enterprise surveys of RBI conducted during October-December 2023, point to rise in business optimism over a period from Q4: FY 2023-24 to Q2: FY 2024-25. However, the expectation of improved overall business conditions is across each of the three quarters in the case of services and infrastructure sectors, with manufacturing sector expected to improve significantly only in Q2: FY 2024-25. 20. The growth performance in FY 2023-24 provides a strong base for the prospects for the next financial year. The assessment by international agencies point to significant improvement in the global trade conditions in 2024 and the economic growth is expected to remain stable at the level of the previous year. The international commodity price pressures are expected to remain moderate. In the domestic economy, favourable rainfall during the monsoon would be crucial in achieving both benign inflation and growth scenarios. With a target for reduction in the fiscal deficit in place, the availability of funds to the private investment would be less constrained than otherwise. While each of these conditions would be subject to risks, sustained growth momentum that focuses on domestic sources of demand is also likely. 21. Taking into account the various factors, the real GDP growth for 2024-25 has now been projected at 7% with quarterly growth of 7.2%, 6.8%, 7% and 6.9% in Q1 to Q4, respectively. The forecast is based on a normal monsoon for the year, which would also support rural consumption demand. The RBI Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in January 2024 provides a median forecast of real GDP growth of 6.5 per cent in 2024-25, revised upward from the forecast of 6.3% in November 2023 round of the survey. 22. The headline consumer price index, YOY basis, increased by 5.6% in November and 5.7% December 2023, following relatively lower rates in the previous two months. The higher inflation rate in November and December was due to food inflation at 8% and 8.7%, respectively. Fuel and light index declined during November and December, YOY basis, and the price index excluding food and fuel (core inflation) rose by 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. Therefore, in the present conditions, deceleration in food inflation would be key to bringing down the headline inflation to the target on a sustained basis. 23. The elevated food price inflation in December was marked by double digit increase in the prices, on a YOY basis, of pulses, fruits, vegetables and spices; the cereals and products and sugar and confectionary price indices rose by more than 6%. Meat and fish, eggs, milk & products, oils & fats, non-alcoholic beverages, and prepared meals, snacks etc. registered price rise of below 6%. A number of food items, therefore, registered high levels of price rise in December. Going forward, in the short term, deceleration in food prices would require a favourable rabi harvest and an adequate supply response. 24. The Expectations Survey of urban households conducted by RBI during Jan 2-11 indicates decline in the current and one year ahead inflation but an increase in the 3- months ahead horizon, suggesting moderation in price pressures in the medium term. 25. RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys conducted in October-December 2023 point to a mixed picture for price conditions across sectors. In the immediate short-term period of Q4, the survey reveals expectations of declining input cost pressures in manufacturing but rising pattern in services and infrastructure. Consistent with the cost perceptions, larger proportion of firms expect increased selling prices in Q4: 2023-24 and subsequent two quarters in services and infrastructure. 26. The Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) conducted by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, during December 2023, reports a significant increase in one-year ahead unit cost based expected inflation as compared to the findings of its survey in November 2023. The survey also reports an increase in the one-year ahead expected headline inflation rate to 4.96% in December 2023 from 4.73% in October 2023. Respondents to the survey were from companies mainly from the manufacturing sector.1 27. The RBI Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in January 2024 provides estimated median forecast of headline inflation at 5.1% in Q4 2023-24 followed by 5.2%, 3.8%, and 4.9% in Q1 to Q3 2024-25, respectively. The projected CPI inflation rate for 2024-25 is 4.6%. 28. Taking into account the various factors, the CPI inflation rate for 2023-24 is projected at 5.4%, with Q4 at 5%. The CPI inflation rate for 2024-25 is projected at 4.5% with quarterly projections of 5%, 4%, 4.6% and 4.7% for Q1 to Q4, respectively. 29. The present growth and inflation scenarios are nearly the same as we saw them in December: surprisingly strong growth momentum despite the several adverse conditions with prominent uneven patterns across sectors and sources of demand. The uncertainty over global economic conditions due to geopolitical conflicts and weather conditions has also persisted. As far as GDP growth is concerned, the baseline projections for 2024-25, are now revised upward compared to the projections in December. The inflation forecast for the first three quarters of 2024-25 is marginally lower than in the December projections but above 4.5% in Q3 and Q4. 30. Given the implications of current elevated levels of food inflation to the overall inflation pressures, and the prevailing strong overall growth, there is a need to remain focussed on achieving the inflation target in a sustained way. As we had observed in the December 2023 meeting, the transmission of increases in policy rates effected up to February 2023 is still incomplete. Therefore, it is critically important at this juncture to continue with the present policy rates so that the moderation in inflation rate to the target is achieved in a sustained manner. 31. Therefore, I vote: i) to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and ii) to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 32. Geopolitical risks continue but neither have oil prices risen as much as feared nor has global growth slowed as much as expected. As inflation approaches their target, advanced economy (AE) central banks (CBs) have announced rate cuts in 2024 as they recognize a further rise in real interest rates as inflation falls would be an over-correction and nuanced actions are required for a soft landing. Some emerging market CBs have already cut rates. 33. Indian growth has also exceeded expectations, demonstrating resilience to global shocks. But many high frequency indicators softened in November and December. Even so, imports continue to grow in volume terms and there is no slowing in credit growth. That capacity utilization has not risen despite good growth suggests private investment is taking place. 34. Inflation has also come in below predictions and core inflation continues to soften, again indicating that output remains below capacity. Reforms and structural changes are reducing costs. Profit margins have risen although corporates are preferring volume over price growth. Corporate results show real sales growth continued to outpace nominal growth in Q3. FMCG majors are cutting prices because of local competitors. Oil majors also have room to cut prices. Current perceptions and long-term household inflation expectations have softened. There seems to be overall acceptance that inflation is moving towards the target. This should anchor core inflation around 4%. Faster than expected fiscal consolidation and a continuing better composition of government expenditure, will also lower inflationary pressures. 35. Since growth is still robust and recent headline inflation has been near the upper tolerance band, we can wait a bit longer to ensure that inflation continues movement to the target despite any geopolitics related or other commodity price shocks. The experience of the past year suggests commodity price shocks may now be short-lived and may not raise inflation persistently. Then it would not be necessary to keep rates high just because supply shocks are expected in the future. But we can wait to test this for some more time. So, I vote for status quo on rates though headline inflation FY25 projections of 4.5% gives room to cut. The rise in headline inflation towards 5% expected later in the year is due to base effects and an expected rise in food prices, but the latter are highly uncertain. I also agree to the stance interpreted in terms of policy rates still being disinflationary and vote for status quo on the stance. 36. Further supply-side improvements that could reduce shocks are necessary. Better integrated markets in AEs prevent the kind of food price shocks we have to face. Modern supply chains should use our geographical diversity as well as imports to prevent sharp fluctuations in key vegetable prices. 37. The daily weighted average call rate (WACR) has often exceeded the repo rate in the past few months. Just as the tightening cycle started by withdrawing liquidity to ensure the repo rate would rise above the reverse repo, now after 6 months of tight banking liquidity, and as expected real rates rise, measures to ensure the WACR largely stays at the repo rate are required. These would also bring down short rates and are part of the natural development of the liquidity adjustment framework that supports inflation targeting. 38. Even if the WACR exceeding the repo was due to unprecedented and extended large government cash balances, the toolkit to counter these and the many other shocks to which liquidity in India is subject to, can be expanded and activated. Part of surplus Government cash balances are already considered for VRR auctions, cash management itself can be improved and government borrowing staggered. Moving to the just in time mode would save interest costs. Money market timings can be extended and market microstructure developed to enable banks to lend to each other. 39. Banks are the only conduit of liquidity to the rest of financial system and they tend to hoard liquidity if it is tight. Since nonbank financial intermediaries do not have access to a lender of last resort and penalties for credit default are now high they also tend to hold excess liquidity. As a result large swathes of the credit system do not get serviced. 40. Work on resilience2 suggests CBs should act to reduce risk premiums anywhere in the financial system. An effective example of this is in the Indian foreign exchange (FX) market where rupee volatility and FX forward premiums have declined. This is one reason we have seen large debt inflows coming in at the narrowest interest differentials in the last 2 months3 and again points to the freedoms Indian policy rates have from US rates. 41. Macroprudential tightening also pre-emptively reduces balance sheet (BS) stress as do better macro fundamentals and fiscal consolidation. But adequate liquidity is also important to prevent illiquidity raising costs, turning into insolvency and creating BS stress. A major reason the Silicon Valley Bank collapse was not followed by others was the broad liquidity support the Fed made available to stressed financial institutions even as it continued with quantitative tightening. Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma 42. Inflation is projected to average 4.5% in 2024-25, and, therefore, the current policy rate of 6.5% translates into a real rate of 2%. I do not believe that such a high real rate is required at this stage to drive inflation down to the target of 4%. It is true that economic growth is holding up well, but there is no evidence at all that the economy is overheating. 43. Perhaps, the majority of the MPC worry that the output gap has already closed, and that the projected growth rate of 7% for 2024-25 exceeds the growth potential of the Indian economy. I do not think that such growth pessimism is warranted. During the last few years, we have seen several policy measures including digitalization, tax reforms, and a step up in infrastructure investment that should boost the potential growth rate of the economy. Also, the compound average growth rate of real GDP from the pre- pandemic level is quite low: 4\u00bc% per annum from 2019-20 to 2023-24 (First Advance Estimate). Growth pessimism would require one to assume that the pandemic induced a massive permanent scarring of the economy. To the contrary, all indications are that the economy has been quite resilient, and even sectors that were badly battered by the pandemic are bouncing back. 44. If the potential growth rate of the economy is close to 8%, then the economy is not at risk of overheating in 2024-25. A real interest rate of 1-1.5% would then be sufficient to glide inflation to the target of 4%. A real interest rate of 2% creates the very real risk of turning growth pessimism into a self fulfilling prophecy. 45. It must also be borne in mind that the process of fiscal consolidation is projected to continue in 2024-25. This opens up space for monetary easing without risking an inflationary spiral. In my view, the time has come for the MPC to send a clear signal that it takes its dual mandate of inflation and growth seriously, and that it would not maintain a real interest rate that is significantly more than what is needed to achieve its target. 46. I therefore vote to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points, and to change the stance to neutral. 2 Brunnermeier, M. 2024.

Available at: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181- 021-02099-z 47. Let me start from the outlook I had given in my December 2023 minutes, \u201cWhile a durable growth path backed by consumption and investment is visible from here on, the same cannot be said about disinflation yet. The below 5 per cent print in October 2023 may reverse as early as next month.\u201d Since the last policy, the growth inflation dynamics have evolved largely along these lines. Growth is holding up better than expected, while the inflation prints in November and December crossed 5 per cent. Core inflation has shown marked and durable signs of disinflation that gives us comfort from monetary policy perspective, but upside risks remain from food inflation. 48. Two other comforting developments since the last policy needs attention. The first relates to the global economy that is performing better than expected earlier. Global growth prospects have improved and inflation in advanced economies is slowly inching down, though intermittently deviating from the declining trend. Global commodity prices remain benign and crude oil prices have not risen despite several new flash points in the ongoing conflicts. Second, the central government in its interim budget stayed the course on a fiscal consolidation path. A prudent fiscal policy can reinforce the credibility of the flexible inflation targeting framework and thus help in anchoring the long-term inflation expectations.4 With less budgeted market borrowings and bond inclusion driven flows expected in 2024, the fisc has vacated space for the private sector on the one hand, while on the other hand taken steps to crowd in private investment through its continued focus on capex and other long term sustainable growth initiatives in areas like solar energy, health, innovation and renewables. 49. Against this backdrop, I vote to maintain status quo on rate and stance for the following reasons. 50. First, it may be recalled that we had frontloaded our rate actions by raising the repo rate cumulatively by 250 bps during May 2022 to February 2023 unlike central banks in advanced economies and several emerging market economies where rate hikes were of much higher order. In April 2023, when we paused majority of market participants were still expecting the MPC to hike rates. In other words, we did not raise our interest rates to a very restrictive zone, unlike the 400-500 bps increase seen by western central banks. 51. Second, given the growth-inflation dynamics, and the uncertainty related to the inflation path going ahead, it would be better to continue with status quo to get more clarity on the current rabi crop and upcoming monsoon rains to further reaffirm our conviction of a durable downward trajectory of inflation towards 4 per cent. 52. Third, markets are currently running ahead of policy makers worldwide including India. Any change in policy direction is going to have a multiplier effect. This is particularly tricky considering that transmission has slowed down in the last two months. The weighted average lending rate on fresh loans from commercial bank has fallen by 18 bps during November-December 2023.5 Any change at this stage could be a misstep and an undoing of the gains made so far. 4 Sims, C. A. (2004). \u2018Limits to inflation targeting. The inflation-targeting debate\u2019 (pp. 283-310). University of Chicago Press. 5 The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans rose by 181 bps during the current tightening cycle (May 2022 \u2013 December 2023). However, during November and December, the WALR on fresh rupee loan declined by 18 bps. 53. Fourth, led by productivity improvement through digitalisation and formalisation of the economy, increased capital formation, favourable demography, and new drivers of growth such as services exports, India\u2019s potential growth is most likely now higher.6 This allows us to move more cautiously on inflation front. Softer core inflation despite strong growth supports this argument. 54. Fifth, successfully managing the final descent of inflation is the most challenging part of the journey and the history of past 100 inflation episodes teaches us that inflation shock, in general, tends to be persistent. What matters for success in defeating inflation is consistency and credibility of policy that helps firmly anchor inflation expectations.7 Avoiding any pre-mature move will help us guard against the biggest challenge to credibility, i.e., having to backpedal later if faced with upside surprises to inflation.8 55. Finally, let me emphasise that today we are in a period of transition, which is a little delicate where neither forward guidance works nor pre-emptive policy actions. Expectations of a change make agents and market participants behave in a way as if the change has already happened, which makes managing the present even tougher. For example, very recently we saw that expectations of rate cuts by major advanced economies have made global markets very exuberant. This makes the job of central banks even more difficult, especially since the last leg of disinflation is still pending. Caution and conservatism are the key during transition times unlike black swan events of the recent past when decisive, aggressive and innovative approaches worked. Staying the full course with determination without getting carried away is the best bet to address these transition challenges. Our strong fundamentals will help us to come out even stronger. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 56. Recent advance estimates of the National Statistical Office (NSO) and subsequently available high frequency indicators point to the momentum of domestic economic activity being sustained. This is underpinned by a shift from consumption to investment. Although a fuller private capex cycle is yet to gather steam, high corporate profitability, the surging housing and real estate market and the strong commitment to fiscal consolidation \u2013 now and in the medium-term \u2013 should quicken its broader-based onset. Productive capacity of the economy is expanding, mostly financed domestically as evident in the modest current account deficit. Consequently, growth impulses are insulated from the volatility of international financial flows in a highly uncertain and unsettled global environment. On the other hand, private consumption, which accounts for 57 per cent of GDP, is languishing under the strain of still elevated food inflation. This is particularly telling in rural areas. Inflation has to be restrained to its target for growth to be inclusive and sustained. 57. Persisting food supply pressures are holding hostage the disinflation that has been led by the steady easing of core inflation. In the latest CPI print for December 2023, unfavourable base effects snuffed out a decline in the momentum of food inflation. As winter\u2019s seasonal price softening fades, however, demand-supply imbalances in the food category may show up again; they should not be allowed to negate the gains of monetary policy\u2019s restraint on core inflation. Sentiment indicators are conducive. Consumer confidence is steadily improving across rural and urban areas even as 6 I have elaborated on this point in my last minutes. 7 Ari Anil and Lev Ratnovski (2023). \u2018History\u2019s Inflation Lessons\u2019. Finance and Development. December. 8 International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook update, January 2024. inflation expectations of households have dipped over a year ahead, and they are more certain of this outcome in their current perceptions. Business sentiment is also upbeat, particularly among services sector firms. In the manufacturing sector, nominal sales growth is inching up, led by volume expansion. Debt servicing burdens and staff costs are moderating while profitability continues to expand. 58. The optimism generated by these evolving macroeconomic conditions and the recent improvement in financial conditions in response to prudent and growth-stimulating budgetary announcements would come full circle if inflation eases and aligns with the target. The outlook for the Indian economy remains highly sensitive to inflation risks. High inflation erodes purchasing power, especially for those least protected against the higher costs of essentials like food. Restoring price stability is beneficial for all. Accordingly, monetary policy must remain restrictive and maintain downward pressure on inflation while minimising the output costs of disinflation. It is only when inflation subsides and stays close to the target lastingly that policy restraint can be eased. Hence, I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged and for continuing with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 59. In the current challenging and unsettled global environment, India presents a picture of strength and resilience. Our proactive, multi-pronged and calibrated policies have worked well to maintain and strengthen macroeconomic and financial stability. Our approach can be a good template for the future. Considering that price and financial stability are the foundations for strong, sustainable and inclusive growth, our endeavour all along has been to take a holistic approach to keep the economy in balance. 60. Real GDP in 2023-24 is expected to grow at 7.3 per cent on top of a growth of 7.2 per cent recorded in 2022-23. Inflation is edging down and is expected to soften to 5.4 per cent in 2023-24 from 6.7 per cent in the previous year (average for the year). Consumer confidence is rising, business sentiments remain upbeat and inflation expectations are getting steadily anchored. 61. CPI inflation has fallen decisively from the heightened levels of last summer, led by steady and sustained disinflation in core, though there have been intermittent interruptions caused by adverse food price shocks. This was so recently when food inflation picked-up to 8.7 per cent in December from 6.3 per cent in October. Consequently, headline inflation rose from 4.9 per cent in October to 5.7 per cent in December, even as core inflation (CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) softened to a four-year low of 3.8 per cent. Deflation in fuel has also deepened. 62. Inflation is expected to soften further to an average of 4.5 per cent in 2024-25 with a fleeting trough of 4 per cent in Q2. Food price uncertainty remains a major source of volatility for headline inflation outlook. Growing geo-political tensions and supply chain disruptions due to new flash points also pose further risks to the inflation outlook. 63. GDP growth, going forward, is expected to remain resilient with the momentum of economic activity continuing in 2024-25. Rabi sowing is now better than last year\u2019s, which along with persisting momentum in allied activities, would support rural consumption. Urban demand continues to be strong. Private capex cycle has turned up, supported by government\u2019s infrastructure thrust and twin balance sheets advantage from healthy corporates and banks. In fact, a strong growth in fixed investment validates the turnaround in the investment cycle which I have been emphasising in my previous statements during the year. Net external demand is expected to get an uplift from improving global outlook. On the supply side, manufacturing activity remains upbeat, aided by improving profit margins. Services sector is in a bright spot on the back of strong domestic demand. Accordingly, we expect real GDP to grow by 7.0 per cent in 2024-25. 64. The current setting of monetary policy is moving in the right direction, with growth holding firm and inflation trending down to the target. At this juncture, monetary policy must remain vigilant and not assume that our job on the inflation front is over. We must remain committed to successfully navigating the \u2018last mile\u2019 of disinflation which can be sticky. As markets are front-running central banks in anticipation of policy pivots, any premature move may undermine the success achieved so far. Price and financial stability are essential to sustain a long haul of high growth. Policy imperative at the current juncture is to remain focused on achieving the 4 per cent inflation target on a durable basis, keeping in mind the objective of growth. Accordingly, I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the focus on withdrawal of accommodation. ", "file6": "The forty eighth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during April 3 to 5, 2024. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, 2. Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic 5. situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (April 5, 2024) decided to: Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. 6. The global economy exhibits resilience and is likely to maintain its steady growth in 2024. Inflation is treading down, supported by favourable base effects though stubborn services prices are keeping it elevated relative to targets. As the central banks navigate the last mile of disinflation, financial markets are responding to changing perceptions on the timing and pace of monetary policy trajectories. Equity markets are rallying, while sovereign bond yields and the US dollar are exhibiting bidirectional movements. Gold prices have surged on safe haven demand. 7. The domestic economy is experiencing strong momentum. As per the second advance estimates (SAE), real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at 7.6 per cent in 2023-24 on the back of buoyant domestic demand. Real GDP increased by 8.4 per cent in Q3, with strong investment activity and a lower drag from net external demand. On the supply side, gross value added recorded a growth of 6.9 per cent in 2023-24, driven by manufacturing and construction activity. 8. Looking ahead, an expected normal south-west monsoon should support agricultural activity. Manufacturing is expected to maintain its momentum on the back of sustained profitability. Services activity is likely to grow above the pre-pandemic trend. Private consumption should gain steam with further pick-up in rural activity and steady urban demand. A rise in discretionary spending expected by urban households, as per the Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer survey, and improving income levels augur well for the strengthening of private consumption. The prospects of fixed investment remain bright with business optimism, healthy corporate and bank balance sheets, robust government capital expenditure and signs of upturn in the private capex cycle. Headwinds from geopolitical tensions, volatility in international financial markets, geoeconomic fragmentation, rising Red Sea disruptions, and extreme weather events, however, pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2024-25 is projected at 7.0 per cent with Q1 at 7.1 per cent; Q2 at 6.9 per cent; Q3 at 7.0 per cent; and Q4 at 7.0 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. 9. Headline inflation softened to 5.1 per cent during January-February 2024, from 5.7 per cent in December. After correcting in January, food inflation edged up to 7.8 per cent in February primarily driven by vegetables, eggs, meat and fish. Fuel prices remained in deflation for the sixth consecutive month in February. CPI core (CPI excluding food and fuel) disinflation took it down to 3.4 per cent in February \u2013 this was one of the lowest in the current CPI series, with both goods and services components registering a fall in inflation. 10. Going ahead, food price uncertainties would continue to weigh on the inflation outlook. An expected record rabi wheat production in 2023-24, however, will help contain cereal prices. Early indications of a normal monsoon also augur well for the kharif season. On the other hand, the increasing incidence of climate shocks remains a key upside risk to food prices. Low reservoir levels, especially in the southern states and outlook of above normal temperatures during April-June, also pose concern. Tight demand supply conditions in certain pulses and the prices of key vegetables need close monitoring. Fuel price deflation is likely to deepen in the near term following the recent cut in LPG prices. After witnessing sustained moderation, cost push pressures faced by firms are showing upward bias. The recent firming up of international crude oil prices warrants close monitoring. Geo-political tensions and volatility in financial markets also pose risks to the inflation outlook. Taking into account these factors and assuming a normal monsoon, CPI inflation for 2024-25 is projected at 4.5 per cent with Q1 at 4.9 per cent; Q2 at 3.8 per cent; Q3 at 4.6 per cent; and Q4 at 4.5 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly balanced. The MPC noted that domestic economic activity remains resilient, backed by 11. strong investment demand and upbeat business and consumer sentiments. Headline inflation has come off the December peak; however, food price pressures have been interrupting the ongoing disinflation process, posing challenges for the final descent of inflation to the target. Unpredictable supply side shocks from adverse climate events and their impact on agricultural production as also geo-political tensions and spillovers to trade and commodity markets add uncertainties to the outlook. As the path of disinflation needs to be sustained till inflation reaches the 4 per cent target on a durable basis, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting. Monetary policy must continue to be actively disinflationary to ensure anchoring of inflation expectations and fuller transmission. The MPC will remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the target. The MPC believes that durable price stability would set strong foundations for a period of high growth. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. 12. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. 13. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted for a change in stance to neutral. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on April 19, 2024. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during June 5 to 7, 2024. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent 16. High growth and moderating inflation rates have marked the prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The recent assessment by the National Statistical Organisation in its Second Advance Estimates places the year on year growth of GDP in Q3: 2023-24 at 8.4 per cent, the third consecutive quarter this year with a growth rate of above 8 per cent. The annual growth of GDP for 2023-24 is now estimated at 7.6 per cent, higher than the growth of 7 per cent in the previous year, and also above the First Advance Estimates for the current year. The annual headline inflation rate for February was 5.1 per cent the same level as in the previous month and well below 5.7 per cent in December 2023. 17. Agriculture and allied activities is the only one among the main production sectors with a marginal growth of less than 1 per cent in GVA. Industry is estimated to grow at 8.3 per cent and services at 7.9 per cent in 2023-24. Growth in industry has followed negative growth (-0.6) per cent in 2022-23 and services sector has registered a high growth of 7.9 per cent over 9.9 per cent in the previous year. Year on year growth rate of GVA in mining and manufacturing in the industry and construction and the composite financial, real estate, and personal services in the services exceeded 8 per cent in 2023-24. The Index of Industrial Production shows, however, that there are sub-sectors in manufacturing such as chemicals, textiles, readymade garments and leather in which output growth during April-2023- January 2024 has been subdued. Weakness in the external demand conditions has posed constraints on some of export-oriented industries. 18. The expenditure side is marked by high growth in investment demand relative to consumption. The former expanded by 10.2 per cent over the previous year and the latter by 3 per cent. The quarterly assessments point to improvement in consumption expenditure as private final consumption expenditure rose by 3.5 per cent in Q3 compared to 2.4 per cent growth in Q2: 2023-24. 19. On the inflation front, the pattern remains the same, which prevailed at the time of MPC meeting of February: expectations of moderation in inflation rates of fuels and the \u2018core\u2019 items of consumption leading to softening of the headline inflation in Q4: 2023-24. The actual inflation rates for January and February have reflected the projected trends as the headline rate dropped to 5.1 per cent and food inflation was above 7.5 per cent. Although the projections for 2024-25 in the February MPC meeting were at 4.5 per cent, the headline inflation trajectory reflected rates above 4.5 per cent for three out of four quarters in 2024-25. 20. The favourable outlook for the short-term is, therefore, conditioned by the continuation of the present growth and inflation trends. The economic conditions in 2023-24 were also impacted by the slow recovery of overall global economic growth and moderation in inflation rates combined with a decline in commodity prices, particularly crude oil and vegetable oils. The supportive economic policies have sustained domestic growth and investment inflows. The indicators of current economic activity reflect strong momentum of growth 21. in a number of sectors. Indicators such as high levels of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector, government capital expenditure, FDI inflows have remained positive for investment spending. Although expansion of private consumption expenditure has lagged behind GFCF and exports, even with reference to the levels in 2019-20, there has been a steady improvement in the consumer confidence of urban households, particularly on the general economic conditions, employment, and household income, as reflected in the sample household surveys carried out by the RBI. The RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys conducted during January to March 2024 indicate that the demand conditions in H1: 2024-25 for manufacturing and infrastructure firms are expected to remain stable; in the case of services, conditions are expected to improve significantly. The broader measures of economic activity such as decline in unemployment rate and steady bank credit growth point to the favourable conditions. A key exogenous factor impacting the outlook in 2024-25 is the nature of the monsoon this year. The present expectations are one of a normal monsoon, which would help bolster the output performance of agriculture, rural demand and moderate inflation pressures. Taking these factors into account the GDP growth for 2024-25 is projected at 7 22. per cent, the same level as in the February meeting of the MPC. The quarterly projections are 7.1 per cent in Q1, 6.9 per cent in Q2 and 7 per cent each in Q3 and Q4. RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters carried out in March 2024 provides a median real GDP growth forecast of 6.7 per cent for 2024-25, with an upward revision from its previous assessment of 6.5 per cent. 23. On the inflation front, as noted, food inflation trends would remain crucial to sustaining the movement of the headline inflation closer to the policy target of 4 per cent on a durable basis. Global conditions affecting commodity prices are the other exogenous elements impacting the fuel prices and prices of other inputs. These conditions- the food inflation and the global supply, and price conditions remain subject to significant risks given the uncertain weather events and geoeconomic conflicts affecting supply chains. However, short term spikes may not affect the projected headline inflation trajectory, given the moderating trend in the recent period in the forward looking expectations of inflation by the households (RBI\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of Households and Business Inflation Expectations Survey by the Misra Centre for Financial Markets and Economy, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad). But prolonged disturbances in the supply conditions would be a concern. 24. Based on an assessment of the developing situation and the assumption of a normal monsoon, the headline inflation for Q4: 2023-24 is projected at 5 percent, Q1: 2024-25 at 4.9, Q2 at 3.8, Q3 at 4.6 and Q4 at 4.5 per cent. The average inflation rate for 2024-25 is projected at 4.5 per cent, the same as in the February MPC meeting. The RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in March 2024 also places the forecast for 2024-25 at 4.5 per cent. The prevailing macroeconomic conditions point to a continuation of the strong 25. growth momentum into 2024-25, particularly as a normal monsoon brings relief to the outlook for agricultural sector. A favourable monsoon is also crucial in bringing down the present high levels of food inflation rates, which would also support consumption demand in the rural economy. Sustaining the growth momentum will require moderate levels of consumer inflation. Tight monetary policy and government interventions in managing the supply side shocks on the food and energy front have been important in moderating inflation. While the projected inflation trends point to further moderation in inflation rate in 2024-25, they also indicate an upturn well above the target rate of 4 per cent in the second half of the year. Given the strong momentum of growth at this juncture, it is necessary to maintain monetary policy focus on aligning the inflation trends with the target. 26. Accordingly, I vote: i. to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and ii. to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 27. Global trade seems to be recovering but growth is mixed and geopolitical risks continue. Inflation has come down substantially but further progress is slow. The consensus of current research for advanced economies (AEs) seems to be that those who thought inflation was largely driven by supply-side bottlenecks were right after all, because it has come down sharply without prolonged macroeconomic tightening. It persisted longer than supply chain unravelling because of labour market tightness1. Longer term inflation expectations remained anchored and central bank tightening helped ensure that. India did not have a tight labour market but recurrent food price shocks 28. created inflation persistence. A rapid rise in repo rates, as well as government supply-side action, helped anchor inflation expectations. Real rates near equilibrium kept demand in balance with supply. 29. Partly as a result, commodity shocks were transient in 2023. This transience suggests it is not necessary to keep rates high because of expected future shocks. Moreover, even reaching 4% is no warranty inflation will stay at 4% if there are large shocks such as the pre and post pandemic ones. 30. In term of current and expected core inflation, real interest rates are now higher than the natural or neutral interest rate (NIR) compatible with keeping inflation at target and output at potential. This is less of a worry at present, since corporate profits are also high and despite some issues, growth is strong; private investment is rising in sectors where there is innovation or capacity is reached; exports and rural consumption are recovering. Most important, credit growth continues to be robust. The slight slackening in momentum, especially in categories with sharp growth, is desirable since credit spikes create risk. India\u2019s relatively low credit/GDP ratio has to rise, but it is best if this happens gradually so that it is sustainable. 31. But there has to be a limit to squeezing core inflation to compensate for periodic headline shocks. Core sustaining below 4% implies real policy rates are in the contraction zone. 32. Real policy rates kept near the neutral rate of around unity after the pandemic, along with supply-side action to neutralize shocks, supported growth while anchoring inflation expectations. But real rates rise as inflation falls and if they sustain above neutral rates lagged effects of monetary policy will start reducing growth after some months2. Flexible inflation targeting (FIT) is forward-looking and aims to ensure expected real rates do not rise above the NIR. Since the NIR is time varying and difficult to estimate precisely, judgement is important. 33. It is possible to assess relevant factors affecting the Indian NIR in the policy time horizon3. Higher growth and demand for credit raise the NIR, but reforms raising potential output and enabling non-inflationary rise in low per capita incomes; higher capital inflows, lower current account deficit, reduction in fiscal deficits, use of prudential risk weights and provisioning that lower risk premiums4; wage growth below productivity growth all tend to lower the NIR. Since these factors work in opposite directions they may cancel each other. 34. Expected medium-run variables are more important for current policy in emerging markets that are far from a steady-state. So inflation itself gives useful insights for determining feasible or potential growth. Inflation approaching the target suggests the absence of over-heating so growth is below potential and the NIR has not risen. If despite robust growth core inflation is less than 4%, yet continues to fall, there cannot be excess demand. The IIM Ahmedabad survey finds firms\u2019 average inflation expectations remained well-anchored at 4.3% in the past year. Firms may have internalized the inflation target apart from restructuring and reducing costs. Non-inflationary high growth is feasible as part of a transitional catch-up process that would create productive jobs for India\u2019s underemployed youth, 35. Core sustaining near target inflation and average headline below 5 implies a credible approach to target, since research for the FIT period suggests long-run causality continues to be from core to headline inflation despite the pandemic shocks5. Publishing forecasts of core inflation can help the convergence of headline 2 Fear of this has made the US Fed\u2019s \u2018higher for longer\u2019 to change from policy rates to inflation. There is more willingness to allow inflation to remain marginally above target for longer in order to reduce output sacrifice. 3 IMF (April 2023) in Chapter 2 of the World Economic Outlook estimates the long-term Indian NIR will converge to AE levels that will go back to pre-pandemic lows. 4 See Goyal et.al. (2021), for a cross-country estimation of the, factors including exchange rates, that affect EM risk premiums. Goyal (2024) analyses open economy factors affecting Indian interest rates. For example, one year forward exchange rate premium that was 5.19% over 2014-19 fell to 1.95% in 2023. Goyal, A., Verma, A., and Sengupta, R. 2021. \u2018\u2018External shocks, cross-border flows and macroeconomic risks in emerging market economies\u2019 Empirical Economics, 62, pp. 2111-2148.

The time taken for convergence depends on shocks, but the direction does not reverse. It can be faster despite shocks to the extant inflation expectations are more anchored, George, A.T., Bhatia, S., John, J., & Das, P. 2024. 'Headline and Core Inflation Dynamics: Have the Recent Shocks Changed the Core Inflation Properties for India? RBI Bulletin, February: 101-116 Available at: https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewBulletin.aspx?Id=22395 to target inflation. Competitive forecasts are an important discipline in a FIT regime. Core is less volatile than headline but correct forecasts require an understanding of how new data acts in the Indian structure. 36. While there are risks, there are also reasons to expect moderation in future supply shocks and their impacts\u2014such as improved governance6 and steady rise in investment rising with development and diversity; El Nino changing to La Nina; the impact of substitution away from oil, of LPG and petrol-diesel price cuts and falling weights of volatile price items such as food in consumption baskets. resilience 37. Even if the NIR is raised to 1.5% because of abundant caution since steady growth allows a focus on reaching the inflation target the real policy rate is above it at 2% even in terms of expected FY25 headline inflation (4.5%); and even higher in terms of expected core inflation. Despite a cut in repo rates policy will still be contractionary. In the current situation of many types of uncertainty, however, maintaining stability must have priority. Therefore, I continue to vote for a pause in the repo rate and for an unchanged stance. Giving indications of the future repo rate is not compatible with data-based guidance and can create unnecessary market turbulence as it has in the US. Policy continues to be forward-looking since it responds to how data affects published inflation and growth forecasts. Its reaction function should by now be well understood by markets, giving them adequate guidance. The tightness in market liquidity has abated. Such tightness affects short rates 38. more, which have little effect on aggregate demand and inflation. Under FIT, policy transmission occurs best through keeping the repo rate at an appropriate level, determined by domestic factors. Rates transmit through both banks and markets. For example, non-food credit of banks as a % of annual flow of resources available to the commercial sector has averaged 44.3% over 2007-23. Competition from other sources may mean less than full transmission of policy repo to loan rates, but points to growing diversity, maturity, fall in spreads and rising efficiency in the Indian financial sector. Market rates also rise with repo rates. 39. My views are largely the same as in the last meeting (February 2024) and so I will be brief. Despite an uptick in crude oil prices, the outlook for inflation continues to be benign, and I remain convinced that a real interest rate of 1-1.5% would be sufficient to glide inflation to the target of 4%. The current real policy rate of 2% (based on projected inflation for 2024-25) is therefore excessive. 40. This unwarrantedly high real rate imposes significant costs on the economy because of the short run Phillips curve. The fact that economic growth in 2024-25 is projected to slow by over half a percent relative to 2023-24 is a reminder that high interest rates entail a growth sacrifice. Monetary policy should try to reduce this sacrifice while ensuring that inflation (a) remains within the band and (b) glides towards the target. I therefore vote to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points, and to change the 41. stance to neutral. 42. In my last statement of February 2024, I had explained clearly why no easing in stance or rate was desirable at that time. Now between last policy and this policy, what has changed. 43. Real GDP growth has turned out to be firmer with stronger momentum, better than all projections, as per the Second Advance Estimates (SAE) released after February policy. There seems to be minimal scarring of growth due to the pandemic or monetary tightening. 44. CPI headline inflation moderation remains on anticipated lines, though the diverging trajectory between food and core inflation continues. Food inflation remained a hostage to vegetable prices due to shallower winter season price correction, which could linger due to the likely above normal temperatures during the summer. Core inflation softened further since the last policy. This has been broad based across goods and services and almost universal, across all exclusion-based measures of core as well as statistical trimmed mean measures.7 Besides, it is driven by lower price momentum.8 While low core inflation would further the disinflation process, concerns remain on food inflation outlook. We need to remain watchful on upside risks to inflation outlook from adverse climatic factors, supply side shocks and geopolitical events. 45. Going ahead, while monetary policy seems to be on the right track, it is too early to ease guard against inflation. It is important that we gain more confidence on our macro numbers for 2024-25 and their nuances. We are just at the beginning of the financial year. The financial year 2022-23 is not far behind when all our assumptions and projections got altered within a month\u2019s time because of unforeseen events. Few months into the year, we will have clarity on monsoon and its spatial distribution, impact of expected hot weather in the current quarter, rabi production and procurement and kharif sowing, all of which are critical to shape up the growth- inflation balance in 2024-25. Crude outlook is fast changing with the changing perceptions on demand supply in line with the geopolitics and developments in the middle east, which is on the edge. Besides, led by global developments, input prices are showing signs of an uptick, which needs to be watched. Return of inflation to the 4 per cent target is our objective and having come this far, it is not far from sight. We need to utilise the space provided by stronger growth to focus on inflation. Our own history, including that of many other emerging market economies (EMEs), shows that taking any risk on inflation front leads to huge price in terms of unhinging of inflation expectations that elongates the inflation episodes and makes the price stability task more daunting. 46. Globally, market expectation of an early and faster rate cut by advanced economies\u2019 central banks are not aligning with the incoming data that is adding to some uncertainty on market perceptions of timing of policy easing cycle in major economies. In India, however, market expectations at present seem to be closely aligned to the MPC views and assessment. This is a win-win situation for India\u2019s last mile of disinflation process when beliefs are consistent with the policy regime contributing towards anchoring of long-term expectations.9 Therefore, even if the 7 Various exclusion-based measures declined in a range of 10-40 basis points between December 2023 and February 2024. Trimmed mean measures also declined in a range of 20-50 basis points between December 2023 and February 2024, with weighted median moderating from 4.1 per cent in December to 3.6 per cent in February. 8 CPI core momentum (on a Seasonally Adjusted Annualised Rate -SAAR basis) moderated to 2.4 per cent in February 2024 from 3.1 per cent in January. 9 Eusepi, S., and B. Preston (2010): \u201cCentral Bank Communication and Macroeconomic Stabilization,\u201d, American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 2, 235\u2013271. current upside risks to price stability were to materialise, largely pertaining to the non- core components from uncertain food or international commodity prices, anchored inflation expectations may lower the pass through of such shocks10 with benefits that go beyond monetary policy.11 To conclude, in recent years the series of large and unfavourable supply 47. shocks have induced monetary policy with difficult trade-offs12 \u2013 to stabilise both prices and output, which were moving in adverse directions. The MPC has utilised the \u2018flexibility\u2019 of the flexible inflation targeting framework and we have reached a situation in which this trade off seems to have blurred with inflation on a declining path and growth on a firmer footing. During this transition phase, the three Cs \u2013 Caution, Consistency and Credibility \u2013 have been the hallmark. While \u2018caution\u2019 entails \u2018consistency\u2019 eliminates to confirm our conviction, waiting backpedalling in policy decision and \u2018credibility\u2019 facilitates firm anchoring of inflation expectations. This approach has stood us in good stead despite challenges and we need to persevere with this for its merits. To recall, just before we embarked on the path of monetary tightening, it was our endeavour then not to give up the accommodative policy setting till growth takes root and becomes self-sustaining. The fall out is that today growth is on a sustainable path despite monetary tightening. On a similar footing, ensuring a durable downward trajectory of inflation towards the 4 per cent target backed by this approach is the best way to address the transition challenges. Instead of haste for policy action, patience is the need of the hour. Hence, I vote for status quo on rate and stance in this policy. 48. Recent inflation prints and high frequency data on salient food prices indicate that food inflation risks remain elevated. A relatively shallow and short-lived winter trough is giving way to a build-up of price momentum as summer sets in, with forecasts of rising temperatures up to May 2024. Some global food prices are firming up in an environment of rising input costs and supply chain pressures. The headroom provided by the steady core disinflation and fuel price deflation does not assure a faster alignment of the headline with the target. Consequently, headline inflation can be expected to remain in the upper reaches of the tolerance band until favourable base effects come into play in the second quarter of 2024-25. Hence, conditions are not yet in place for any let-up in the restrictive stance of monetary policy. Downward pressure on inflation must be maintained until a better balance of risks becomes evident and the layers of uncertainty clouding the near-term clear away. In the interregnum, the commitment to enduringly aligning inflation with the target of 4 per cent needs to be emphasised. Stabilising inflation expectations is progressing, as reflected in forward-looking surveys; anchoring them is crucial for achieving the inflation target. 49. Domestic demand is expanding, and the output gap has closed. The investment outlook is improving; however, a stronger revival in private consumption and in corporate sales growth may await greater confidence that inflation is declining. The recent improvement in export performance, if sustained, will ease the drag on aggregate demand. 10 G\u00e1ti, L.

Supply responses are also improving, but they will be contingent on a normal monsoon; an upturn in the private investment cycle to boost manufacturing sales and ease capacity constraints; and on sustaining the trend growth of services. The external balance sheet is strong, with a modest current account deficit, ebullient capital flows and rising foreign exchange reserves. This should insulate domestic economic activity from global spillovers in response to regime shifts in monetary policy stances of systemic central banks that are either underway or imminent. Nevertheless, financial stability risks to macroeconomic outcomes in India have to be closely and continuously monitored, and pre-emptively headed off. Overall, price stability has to be restored in order to ensure that the rising growth trajectory that India is embarking upon is sustained. 51. Accordingly, I vote for status quo on the policy rate and for perseverance with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. The Indian economy is growing at a robust pace with an average annual 52. growth of 8 per cent during the last three years. India continues to be the fastest growing major economy in the world, supported by an upturn in investment cycle and revival in manufacturing. Services sector continues to grow at a strong pace. 53. CPI headline inflation during January-February 2024 (5.1 per cent in each of the months) has moderated from the elevated level seen in December 2023 (5.7 per cent). The persistent and broad-based softening in CPI core inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel inflation) by 180 bps since June 2023 is driving the disinflation process, though volatile and elevated food inflation is disrupting its pace. Looking ahead, the baseline projections show inflation moderating to 4.5 per 54. cent in 2024-25 from 5.4 per cent in 2023-24 and 6.7 per cent in 2022-23. This success in the disinflation process should not distract us from the vulnerability of the inflation trajectory to the frequent incidences of supply side shocks, especially to food inflation due to adverse weather events and other factors. Overlapping food price shocks, apart from imparting volatility to headline inflation, may also result in spillovers to core inflation. Lingering geo-political tensions and their impact on commodity prices and supply chains are also adding to uncertainties in the inflation trajectory. These considerations call for monetary policy actions to tread the last mile of disinflation with extreme care. The growth prospects of the Indian economy in 2024-25 look bright. 55. Expectations of normal southwest monsoon in 2024 augur well for the agricultural sector and rural demand. Strengthening rural demand, along with rising consumer confidence and optimism on employment and income, are expected to boost private consumption. Prospects of the manufacturing and services sectors also remain bright. Upbeat business outlook of firms, healthy corporate and bank balance sheets, upturn in private capex cycle with capacity utilisation ruling above the long period average can be expected to give further boost to domestic investment activity. Improving global growth and international trade prospects may provide thrust to external demand. 56. Given these growth inflation dynamics, I believe that the extant monetary policy setting is well positioned. Market expectations are also closely aligned with that of the MPC. Monetary policy transmission is continuing and inflation expectations of households are also getting further anchored. At this stage, we should stay the course and remain vigilant. The gains in disinflation achieved over last two years have to be preserved and taken forward towards aligning the headline inflation to the 4 per cent target on a durable basis. The strong growth momentum, together with our GDP projections for 2024-25, give us the policy space to unwaveringly focus on price stability. Price stability is our mandated goal and it sets strong foundations for a period of high growth. Accordingly, I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the focus on withdrawal of accommodation. ", "file7": "The forty ninth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during June 5 to 7, 2024. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic 5. situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (June 7, 2024) decided to: Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. Global economic activity is rebalancing and is expected to grow at a stable 6. pace in 2024. Inflation has been moderating unevenly, with services inflation staying elevated and slowing progress towards targets. Uncertainty on the pace and timing of policy pivots by central banks is keeping financial markets volatile. Equity markets have touched new highs in both advanced and emerging market economies. Non- energy commodity prices have firmed up, while the US dollar and bond yields are exhibiting two-way movement with spillovers to emerging market currencies. Gold prices have surged to record highs on safe haven demand. 7. According to the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on May 31, 2024, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Q4:2023- 24 stood at 7.8 per cent as against 8.6 per cent in Q3. Real GDP growth for 2023-24 was placed at 8.2 per cent. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) rose by 6.3 per cent in Q4:2023-24. Real GVA recorded a growth of 7.2 per cent in 2023-24. 8. Going forward, high frequency indicators of domestic activity are showing resilience in 2024-25. The south-west monsoon is expected to be above normal, which augurs well for agriculture and rural demand. Coupled with sustained momentum in in private manufacturing and services activity, consumption. Investment activity is likely to remain on track, with high capacity utilisation, healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, government\u2019s continued thrust on infrastructure spending, and optimism in business sentiments. Improving world trade prospects could support external demand. Headwinds from geopolitical tensions, volatility in international commodity prices, and geoeconomic fragmentation, however, pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2024-25 is projected at 7.2 per cent with Q1 at 7.3 per cent; Q2 at 7.2 per cent; Q3 at 7.3 per cent; and Q4 at 7.2 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. Headline inflation has seen sequential moderation since February 2024, albeit 9. in a narrow range from 5.1 per cent in February to 4.8 per cent in April 2024. Food inflation, however, remains elevated due to persistence of inflation pressures in vegetables, pulses, cereals, and spices. Deflation in fuel prices deepened during March-April, reflecting the cut in liquified petroleum gas (LPG) prices. Core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation eased further to 3.2 per cent in April, the lowest in the current CPI series, with core services inflation also falling to historic lows. this should enable a revival 10. Looking ahead, overlapping shocks engendered by rising incidence of adverse climate events impart considerable uncertainty to the food inflation trajectory. Market arrivals of key rabi crops, particularly pulses and vegetables, need to be closely monitored in view of the recent sharp upturn in prices. Normal monsoon, however, could lead to softening of food inflation pressures over the course of the year. Pressure from input costs have started to edge up and early results from enterprises surveyed by the Reserve Bank expect selling prices to remain firm. Volatility in crude oil prices and financial markets along with firming up of non-energy commodity prices pose upside risks to inflation. Taking into account these factors, CPI inflation for 2024- 25 is projected at 4.5 per cent with Q1 at 4.9 per cent; Q2 at 3.8 per cent; Q3 at 4.6 per cent; and Q4 at 4.5 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly balanced. 11. The MPC noted that the domestic growth-inflation balance has moved favourably since its last meeting in April 2024. Economic activity remains resilient supported by domestic demand. Investment demand is gaining more ground and private consumption is exhibiting signs of revival. Although headline inflation is gradually easing, driven by softening in its core component, the path of disinflation is interrupted by volatile and elevated food inflation due to adverse weather events. Inflation is expected to temporarily fall below the target during Q2:2024-25 due to favourable base effect, before reversing subsequently. For the final descent of inflation to the target and its anchoring, monetary policy has to be watchful of spillovers from food price pressures to core inflation and inflation expectations. The MPC will remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the 4 per cent target on a durable basis. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting. The MPC reiterates the need to continue with the disinflationary stance, until a durable alignment of the headline CPI inflation with the target is achieved. Enduring price stability sets strong foundations for a sustained period of high growth. Hence, the MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. 12. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. 13. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted for a change in stance to neutral. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on June 21, 2024. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during August 6 to 8, 2024. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent The macroeconomic environment was marked by a high growth rate of the 16. economy and moderating inflation rate during 2023-24. The Provisional Estimates (PE) released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on May 31, 2024, reinforce the previous growth assessment further. Real GDP growth for 2023-24 is now estimated at 8.2 per cent, following the growth rates of 7 per cent in 2022-23 and 9.7 per cent in 2021-22. While there have been significant fluctuations and differences between the macro estimates available at the time of April MPC meeting and the recent PE for sectoral growth rates and in the sources of aggregate demand on account of both external and domestic factors, the overall growth rate has remained strong, above the 7.6 per cent in the SAE. In the meantime, the headline inflation rate, year-on-year, is at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24 and 5 per cent in Q4: 2023-24. 17. As per the PE for 2023-24, YOY growth of real gross fixed capital formation, reflecting investment demand, accelerated to 9 per cent from 6.6 per cent in 2022-23. Private consumption expenditure growth, however, fell from 6.8 per cent in 2022-23 to 4.0 per cent in 2023-24. Export of goods and services was also marked by deceleration in 2023-24 due to the weak global demand conditions. Going forward, improvement in the growth of consumption demand, exports and sustained growth of investment would be key to maintaining the strong overall growth of the last three years. 18. In terms of real GVA, YOY growth of agriculture and allied activities dropped from 4.7 per cent in 2022-23 to 1.4 per cent in 2023-24. Industry GVA rose from (-)0.6 per cent in 2022-23 to 9.3 per cent in 2023-24, led by manufacturing. Although construction GVA increased by almost 10 per cent in 2023-24, growth of overall services sector GVA slowed to 7.9 per cent in 2023-24 from 9.9 per cent in the previous year. In all the three major production sectors, YOY growth rates are the same or higher in the PE as compared to the SAE for 2023-24. 19. Several indicators reflect continuation of growth momentum into 2024-25. At the global level, the world trade volume is expected to recover in 2024 with growth also expected to hold. In its April 2024 assessment, the IMF projected YOY growth in the world output at 3.2 per cent in 2024, the same as in 2023 and the growth of volume of world trade in goods and services at 3 per cent in 2024 as compared to 0.3 per cent in 2023. Trends in global PMIs suggest stronger growth prospects in the case of services as compared to manufacturing, with both in expansion zone from February to April 2024. 20. In the domestic economy, most of the actual data are available only for April and May for the current financial year. However, surveys of households and enterprises on their expectations and professional forecasts provide assessments for next few quarters or the full financial year 2024-25. Indicators such as PMI for manufacturing and services have remained in the 21. expansion zone during April-May. Non-food bank credit and GST collections expanded at double digit rates on a YOY basis, during April-May 2024. 22. RBI\u2019s consumer confidence survey of urban households indicates cautious optimism. The survey conducted in May 2024, reflects expectation of an increase in both essential and non-essential expenditure one-year ahead. Changes in future sentiments on household income is modest, however, expectations regarding the general economic conditions and employment moderated on one-year ahead basis. 23. Pattern of manufacturing output points to improvement in the production of consumption goods in 2023-24. Consumer goods IIP rose by 3.8% in 2023-24 as compared to 0.7% in 2022-23. Growth in consumer goods IIP improved on a YOY basis in H2: 2023-24 to 4.0 per cent as compared to the growth in H1 at 3.7 per cent. Moreover, consumer non-durables led growth in H1 and consumer durables in H2. Uptick in consumer expenditure reflected by the IIP growth in 2023-24 may be sustained into 2024-25 if the underlying drivers of growth continue. Investment demand indicators in the first two months of Q1, reflect a mixed 24. picture. Steel consumption has increased at a strong growth of 9.6 per cent in April, while cement production remained muted at 0.6 per cent during the month. Imports of capital goods improved in April, YOY basis. The capital expenditure in the public sector is expected to provide support for investment demand as in the previous year. 25. The assessment of the growth prospects for 2024-25 are conditioned by the momentum that has been set by the performance in 2023-24 and several global and domestic factors. While positive aspects of the emerging macroeconomic conditions affecting economic growth in 2024-25 are significant, there are also the risks from adverse scenarios. The spillover effects of continuing international geopolitical conflicts, trade limiting policies across the world, extreme weather events affecting agricultural output pose these adverse conditions. The Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the RBI in May 2024, 26. provides a median forecast of real GDP growth of 6.8 per cent in 2024-25, revised upwards from 6.7 per cent in the previous round of the survey in March. Private Final Consumption Expenditure and Gross Fixed Capital Formation are the growth drivers in these projections. 27. In the April meeting of the MPC, the YOY real GDP growth for 2024-25 was projected at 7 per cent. Taking into account a normal monsoon and sustained momentum of investment, the GDP growth for 2024-25 has now been projected at 7.2 per cent. The quarterly growth rates for GDP are: 7.3 per cent in Q1, 7.2 per cent in Q2, 7.3 per cent in Q3 and 7.2 per cent in Q4. 28. The pace of decline in YOY headline CPI inflation rate in the recent period has been steady. It declined from 5.4 per cent in Q3: 2023-24 to 5 per cent in Q4. The rate declined from 5.1 per cent in January 2024 to 4.8 per cent in April. While the CPI inflation for fuel & light and the non-food and non-fuel categories remained well below 4 per cent, food inflation was above 7.5 per cent in Q4: 2023-24 and 7.9 per cent in April in the current year. A favourable monsoon assisting the recovery of agricultural growth and suitable supply management measures would be a key to moderating food inflation as the year progresses. 29. There are risks to anticipated decline in CPI inflation rate given the uncertainties of temporal and spatial distribution of the rainfall, weather conditions during the crop season and the spillover effects of international geopolitical conflicts. 30. Commodity price trends in the international markets present a mixed pattern. In the case of agricultural prices, in April and May, wheat prices have advanced, rice prices have remained firm and sugar and palm oil prices have shown decline. In the case of other commodities, energy prices have been volatile and metals have increased. Improving world manufacturing output, divergent weather conditions and uncertainties over the impact of the on-going geopolitical conflicts will continue to influence the world commodity prices in the short term. The RBI\u2019s inflation expectations survey of urban households conducted in the 31. first fortnight of May 2024 reflects the current deceleration in the consumer prices but also points to moderate increase in expected inflation rate by 20 and 10 basis points over a short-term horizon of three months and one year, respectively. The early results from the ongoing enterprise surveys by the RBI for April-June point to rising input price pressures in 2023-24, particularly in services and infrastructure. Input price pressures are also followed by expectation of rise in selling prices by majority of the respondents in manufacturing, services and infrastructure sectors. 32. The Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the RBI, referred earlier, provides an assessment of headline inflation in 2024-25. The median YOY CPI inflation rate in 2024-25 estimated from the survey is 4.5 per cent, the same level as estimated in the previous round of the survey in March. The expected \u2018inflation rate\u2019 for CPI excluding food, fuel and pan, tobacco and intoxicants is below 4 per cent. 33. Taking into account these factors, the headline inflation rate has now been projected at 4.5 per cent in 2024-25, the same level as in the April MPC meeting. The quarterly projections are 4.9 per cent in Q1, declining to 3.8 per cent in Q2, rising to 4.6 per cent in Q3 and 4.5 per cent in Q4. The sharp decline in Q2: 2024-25 corresponds to the period when inflation rate was a high 6.4 per cent in 2023-24. The headline inflation rate gradually moving to below 5 per cent mark in March 34. and April, and projected at less than 4 per cent mark in Q2, marks an important macroeconomic condition that can support sustained growth. Clearly, the moderate inflation rate will have to be durable to be an effective condition for sustained growth. In this context, the policy would have to continue its focus on maintaining the inflation rate aligned to the target over the medium term. The rise in projected inflation rate above the 4.5 per cent mark in H2 of the financial year reflects the underlying price pressures, which if not addressed would not meet the policy goal. As a major part of these price pressures relate to food inflation, a watchful approach is appropriate to ensure that there are no spillovers of high food inflation to the prices of the other items in the consumption basket. As the aggregate output projections for 2024-25 reflect strong GDP growth, keeping the monetary policy focus on achieving the inflation target on a durable basis is appropriate at this juncture. 35. With these considerations, I vote i. to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and ii. to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. 36. Indian growth has outperformed expectations once again, suggesting it has strong roots. Real policy rates near neutral, along with supply-side action, have been important in sustaining growth while bringing inflation towards target. As argued in earlier minutes, the neutral real policy rate (NIR) is around unity in Indian conditions of high unemployment and an ongoing transition to higher productivity employment1. 37. Headline inflation has been around 5% since January this year while core inflation has been below 4% since December 2023. Volatile commodity prices, El Nino and heat waves have not been able to reverse the approach to target. The headline inflation projection of 4.5% for 2024-25 gives an average real repo rate of 2% implying that the real repo rate will be above neutral for too long if the repo rate stays unchanged. Falling inflation has raised real repo above unity. This will reduce real growth rate with a lag. Expected growth is around 7% in 2024-25 below the 8% achieved in 2023-242. Status quoism is praised as being cautious. But if doing nothing distorts real variables it aggravates shocks instead of smoothing them and raises risk. 38. Again, as argued earlier, in Indian conditions of growth transition, inflation itself is the best measure of potential growth. If headline inflation is approaching the target and core inflation is below target, and incoming data supports this3, it implies growth is below potential and NIR above neutral; so real policy rates can safely fall. Potential output and NIR defined by inflation require the repo rate to fall with inflation. It cannot be correct to allow monetary policy to become more restrictive the nearer inflation gets to its target. 39. Inflation has come down in the past through supply side action and anchoring of inflation expectations with the NIR at neutral, without a large growth sacrifice. Why then would higher real policy rates be required now to fight inflation that is lower? The sacrifice ratio from NIR above neutral is very high when aggregate supply is elastic as it is in India. Let us examine some common arguments made against cutting the repo rate. 41. First, the fear of recurrent supply shocks. The volatilities facing policy in April have moderated. Global uncertainties continue, but the world seems to have learnt to live with them. Output and trade growth is improving. Conflicts have been contained and international oil prices that are important for India are softening despite extension of OPEC oil cuts, pointing to a reduction in OPEC\u2019s monopoly power. Although global commodity inflation is mixed, palm oil inflation, that affects many consumer goods costs in India, is softening. 1 KLEMS data shows total factor productivity (TFR) for manufacturing and services increased at a higher pace during 2015-16 to 2019-20 (5 years) as compared to that during 2010-11 to 2014-15 (5 years). This helps absorb higher costs without requiring prices to rise and reduces the NIR despite higher growth. 2 The 8% growth was not due to base effects, which had raised Q1 growth after the pandemic year. But in 2023-24 growth rates was even through all the quarters. 3 The projected rise in inflation after a dip below target in August is due to base effects, so the overall approach to the inflation target continues. 42. The good monsoon predicted has already set in and will likely reduce food inflation. The elections are over. Results suggest political stability but also policy continuity rather than disruptive changes. India gets a credible opposition, which strengthens democracy. Even so, a conservative government with a good implementation record will return and is likely to continue with fiscal consolidation through a better composition of expenditure and other short and long-term cost reducing supply-side reforms. In addition to a lower probability of a large supply shock, the experience of the 43. past year shows supply shocks no longer have persistent effects on inflation or on inflation expectations. We have waited for one year to watch the impact of these shocks, now it is time to move on. Household inflation expectations have become much less volatile in the post-pandemic period, falling slowly along with inflation itself. Some anchoring seems to have made them immune to transient shocks. 44. Moreover, a durable approach to the inflation target is consistent with a transient rise in inflation. It is necessary to avoid the mistake of 2015 when international crude oil prices fell substantially but the fear that they would rise again prevented an adequate cut in the policy rate. Real interest rates rose substantially and hurt growth. 45. The second set of arguments is since growth is robust there is no need for a cut. But growth is below potential and may slow further since consumption remains weak. Increasing income and employment is the only sustainable way to bolster consumption, as well as private investment. Transfers from a small percentage cannot give prosperity to a billion people. Reducing unemployment is important for political in productive employment, aggressive and redistribution becomes more likely and may provoke a flight of wealth taking India back to the stagnant seventies. financial stability. Without a rise 46. But will lower repo rates raise already high personal credit growth too much? Over the last two years overall credit growth has been around 15% per annum. This implies a mild rise in credit ratios since nominal GDP growth is about 12%. Indian private credit ratios have to rise safely and steadily towards levels in peer countries, avoiding the type of debt explosion that accompanied Chinese growth. Seasonally adjusted monthly momentum in credit growth is slowing somewhat since January 2024 especially as sectoral prudential regulation moderates building up of excessive leverages. This regulation is preventive and reduces the need for monetary rate action that has broad effects4. 47. Spreads are high in India. Average loan rates are in double digits. While risk- based pricing is required, a cut in repo rates will prevent retail interest rates rising to unbearable levels. There may be some stress in loans to self-employed. If leverage is rising, lower interest rates reduce costs and a possible indebtedness trap. Despite some initial reduction after a repo cut, rising loan demand and slower deposit growth will tend to raise both loan and deposit rates. 48. Third, is the belief, widespread in financial markets that India cannot cut before the US Fed. But the US has its own special problems that do not apply elsewhere. Many other central banks are cutting rates. The fall in India\u2019s current account deficit, index inclusion and ratings upgrade add to the many reasons that make interest differentials with the US less important. India\u2019s inflation differential with the US is also narrowing again. 49. Finally, let us turn to the mechanics of cutting and the communication around it. At present only small steps are required to align the repo with the fall in inflation so this should not be seen as the start of a rate cut cycle. Communication should make it clear that there is no softening path and forward-guidance remains data-determined. A neutral stance is appropriate since the rate can then move in either direction as required. 50. In line with the above reasoning, I vote for a 25 basis points cut to the repo rate and a change in the stance to neutral. Even with these changes, monetary policy would remain disinflationary towards bringing inflation credibly to the target. 51. In my statement for the last meeting (April 2024), I expressed concern about the growth sacrifice in 2024-25 induced by restrictive monetary policy. It now appears that the maintenance of restrictive policy for unwarrantedly long will lead to a growth sacrifice in 2025-26 as well. Professional forecasters surveyed by the RBI are projecting growth both in 2025-26 and in 2024-25 to be lower than in 2023-24 by more than 0.75%, and lower than the potential growth rate (of say 8%) by more than 1%. This is an unacceptably high growth sacrifice considering that headline inflation is projected to be only about 0.5% above target, and core inflation is extremely benign. 52. As I have stated in the last several meetings, the current real policy rate of around 2% (based on projected inflation) is well above the level needed to glide inflation to its target. I therefore vote to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points, and to change the stance to neutral. Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan The arguments made in my last statement are still valid. In a transition phase, 53. the role of the three Cs \u2013 Caution that entails conviction about durable alignment of inflation to the target with more incoming information; Consistency that rules out backpedalling; and Credibility that facilitates firm anchoring of expectations \u2013 is much more relevant. On the whole, we are broadly in a similar monetary policy setting as in the last two bi-monthly reviews. Growth continues to be robust and has surprised further on the upside. While core inflation has softened further, food inflation risks have remained elevated. 54. Our growth projection for 2024-25 has been revised upward for the following reasons. First, GDP recorded a strong momentum (quarter-on-quarter growth) of 7.8 per cent in Q4:2023-24 as against an average of 5.8 per cent during the corresponding quarters of the pre-COVID period (2012-13 to 2019-20). Even the momentum of gross value added (GVA) was strong at 5.7 per cent during Q4:2023-24 in comparison with the average momentum of 2.4 per cent during the same pre- COVID period. This strong momentum is likely to continue supporting growth in 2024- 25. The available high frequency indicators for April-May exhibits optimism to sustain momentum. Second, private consumption which was trailing will now get impetus from rebound in rural demand on the back of expected above normal south-west monsoon and improving agriculture sector. Third, external demand is witnessing a turn around with improving outlook for global trade. In April, merchandise exports entered into positive territory and services exports posted robust double-digit growth. Moreover, KLEMS database available for 2021-22 shows that total factor productivity has improved significantly. Given further digitalisation and formalisation of the economy leading to higher productivity, along with favourable demography, rising labour force participation and accelerated capital formation seems to have led to higher potential growth as I have been highlighting in my last four statements. Perhaps lower pressures from core inflation and the lower current account deficit in a scenario of high growth could be a pointer to it. Of course, monetary policy along with lower input costs have been the main driver of core disinflation. 55. On the inflation front, headline and core inflation have moderated on anticipated lines. There is, however, little comfort in the near-term with inflation projected to remain sticky at around 4.9 per cent in Q1:2024-25 primarily due to the impact of unprecedented heat wave conditions on summer crop of vegetables and fruits; lower agricultural and horticulture production estimates; revision in milk prices across major cooperatives; and signs of a turnaround in commodity prices along with logistics and transportation costs. Food, with a weight of 45.9 per cent in CPI, contributed to three- fourths of the headline inflation in April 2024 compared to about 40 per cent a year ago. Discounting the likely one-off drop in inflation to below target rate in Q2:2024-25 due to favourable base effects, the ongoing disinflation process, though gradual, is expected to continue over the second half of 2024-25, with headline inflation projected at 4.5 per cent by Q4:2025-26. Realisation of a normal monsoon, particularly in terms of its spatial and temporal distribution, and the recharge of reservoirs would be critical for the continued disinflation in food and headline CPI. 56. Against this backdrop, let me elaborate more on why we cannot afford any misjudgement on our policy action at this stage. First, while we can draw some comfort from headline inflation running within the tolerance band successively for eight months in a row, we cannot drop our guard as the headline inflation is still not aligned to the target. Repeated incidence of food price shocks is delaying the final descent of inflation to the target. It is, however, encouraging that elevated food inflation over the last six months have not spilled over into core inflation, reflecting the gains from credibility of our maturing flexible inflation targeting framework. Nevertheless, given the large share of food in the household consumption basket, we need to stay vigilant to resist any such spill over and ensure that such price pressures are clearly dissipated. Any consideration on policy change has to factor in this aspect to avoid backpedalling in future.5 57. Second, there could be an argument that a pause for eight successive policies is a long pause. Let me emphasise, the inertia of inaction should not drive us to action. Rather the driving force should be the macroeconomic setting of growth and inflation. Clearly, the favourable growth-inflation balance and the outlook is pointing towards status quo. That said, even though the repo rate has been kept unchanged since February 2023, several policy actions on liquidity, transmission and communication have played out to stabilise the economy further. The views and assessment of all major stakeholders seem to be closely aligned towards no action at this stage. In any case, we do not face the kind of pressures being faced by some advanced economies which have gone for very restrictive policy settings in the current rate hike cycle. 58. Third, it is also being argued that with the fisc consolidating, monetary policy should be more growth supportive by easing policy rates. The counter argument is two-fold: (a) we need to see what drives fiscal consolidation \u2013 if it is largely driven by higher revenues including dividend, which is the case now, the adverse impact on growth may be non-existent. On the contrary, fiscal consolidation may actually be growth enhancing if it leads to improved country ratings, easing the financial conditions for the private sector and improving the overall sentiment. (b) More 5 IMF, World Economic Outlook, April 2024. importantly, the best contribution that monetary policy can make to long-term growth is via price stability.6 In this context, I stand by what I said in my last minutes that we need to utilise the space provided by stronger growth to focus on inflation. 59. To sum up, our monetary policy actions should continue to be primarily guided by domestic macroeconomic conditions and the outlook. The growth-inflation mix at the current juncture allows us to move more cautiously on the inflation front. Hence, we should not waver from our focus on price stability which remains so important for our long term sustained growth outcome. Accordingly, I vote for status quo on rate and monetary policy stance in this policy. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 60. Economic activity in India is evolving broadly in line with the baseline projection. Prospects of a favourable monsoon should offset the slackening momentum that has become a typical feature of first quarter GDP outturns in the post-pandemic period. Domestic demand should continue to drive the economy, with private consumption receiving a fillip from the revival in rural spending. Corporate balance sheets are showing rising investments in fixed assets, which should find expression in a fuller capital spending upturn. With output in broad balance in relation to its potential, monetary policy can remain neutral to growth at this juncture and stay focused on aligning inflation to the target. That objective remains incomplete, which can undermine medium-term growth prospects. 61. The speed of the easing of inflation has been disappointing so far, even from a cross-country perspective. Food prices are persisting for too long as the principal impediment to a faster disinflation. The Indian economy remains hostage to intersecting food price shocks. Their repetitive occurrence calls for intensifying monetary policy vigil to ward off spillovers to other components of inflation and to expectations. This also warrants looking through the statistical soft patch in inflation\u2019s trajectory that is anticipated during July-August 2024, while staying prepared to blunt the uptick that is expected from September. Food prices are holding back any consideration of possible changes in the monetary policy stance. Hence, I vote for keeping the policy rate and the stance of withdrawal of accommodation unchanged. Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das The global economy is resilient but is growing at a lower rate than its historical 62. trend.7 Inflation is easing unevenly across major economies. With varying growth- inflation dynamics across countries, the importance of domestic factors in policy making has come to the fore. Accordingly, there are initial signs of divergence on monetary policy actions across countries. 63. The Indian economy is growing at a healthy rate, averaging 8.3 per cent in the last three years. During 2023-24, the economy posted an impressive growth of 8.2 per cent despite continued global headwinds and weather vagaries. This was largely driven by domestic demand, especially investment activity. On the supply side, manufacturing and services provided major support to gross value added (GVA). 64. Domestic growth outlook for 2024-25 remains upbeat as economic activity continues to maintain momentum. South-west monsoon is expected to be above normal, boosting agricultural activity and supporting rural consumption. Buoyant services activity should sustain urban consumption. Business confidence remains strong across manufacturing, services and infrastructure sectors. Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates and government\u2019s capex thrust are expected to support investment activity. Projections of improvement in global trade by agencies,8 when they materialise, will spur external demand. Considering these evolving dynamics, GDP growth projection for 2024-25 has been revised upward by 20 basis points to 7.2 per cent. When this happens, it will be the fourth consecutive year of 7.0 per cent or higher GDP growth. 65. Headline CPI inflation is moderating, but at a very slow pace. The last mile of disinflation is turning out to be gradual and protracted. Since the April 2024 MPC meeting, headline inflation moderated by around 30 basis points from 5.1 per cent in February 2024 to 4.8 per cent in April 2024. Inflation in CPI core (CPI excluding food and fuel) and its services sub-component were at historic lows in April 2024. Food inflation is the main factor behind the grudgingly slow pace of disinflation. Recurring and overlapping supply-side shocks continue to play an outsized role in food inflation. 66. Going forward, the baseline projections show inflation moderating to an average 4.5 per cent in 2024-25. In the immediate months, however, the impact of exceptionally warm summer months on output of certain perishables; a likely rabi production shortfall in some pulses and vegetables \u2013 particularly potatoes and onions; and the upward revisions in milk prices, warrant close monitoring. A normal monsoon may eventually lead to easing of price pressures in key food items. Large favourable base effects could lead to a temporary and one-off undershoot of inflation to below the target rate in Q2, before rising again in Q3 and Q4 of 2024-25. 67. The move towards an active disinflationary stance of monetary policy since the beginning of 2022-23 has helped to bring down inflation from its highly elevated levels, break the core inflation persistence and prevent inflation expectations from getting unanchored. The calibrated tightening by 250 basis points between May 2022 to February 2023 has achieved disinflation with minimal output sacrifice as growth remains strong. The growth-inflation balance is moving favourably in line with our projections. 68. Resilient growth creates space for monetary policy to focus unambiguously on inflation which remains well above the 4.0 per cent target. With persistently high food inflation, it would be in order to continue with the disinflationary policy stance that we have adopted. Any hasty action in a different direction will cause more harm than good. It is important that inflation is durably aligned to the target of 4.0 per cent. Price stability is the bedrock for high and sustainable growth. I, therefore, vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent and to continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. ", "file8": "The fiftieth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during August 6 to 8, 2024. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (August 8, 2024) decided to: Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. 6. The global economic outlook remains resilient although with some moderation in pace. Inflation is retreating in major economies but services price inflation persists. International prices of food, energy and base metals have eased since the last policy meeting. With varying growth-inflation prospects, central banks are diverging in their policy paths. This is creating volatility in financial markets. Amidst recent global sell offs in equities, the dollar index has weakened, sovereign bond yields have eased sharply and gold prices have soared to record highs. 7. Domestic economic activity continues to sustain its momentum. After a weak and delayed start, the cumulative southwest monsoon rainfall has picked up with improving spatial spread. By August 7, 2024, it was 7 per cent above the long period average. This has supported kharif sowing, with total area sown as on August 2, being 2.9 per cent higher than a year ago. Industrial output registered an expansion of 5.9 per cent (y-o-y) in May 2024. Core industries rose by 4.0 per cent in June, against 6.4 per cent in May. Other high frequency indicators released during June- July 2024 indicate expansion of services sector activity, ongoing revival of private consumption, and signs of pickup in private investment activity. Merchandise exports, non-oil non-gold imports, services exports and imports expanded during April-June. 8. Going forward, the Indian Meteorological Department\u2019s (IMD) projection of above normal southwest monsoon and healthy kharif sowing will support improving rural demand. The sustained momentum in manufacturing and services suggests steady urban demand. High frequency indicators of investment activity as evident in strong expansion in steel consumption, high capacity utilisation, healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, and the Government\u2019s continued thrust on infrastructure spending, point to a robust outlook. Improving world trade prospects could support external demand. Headwinds from geopolitical tensions, volatility in international commodity prices and geoeconomic fragmentation, however, pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2024-25 is projected at 7.2 per cent with Q1 at 7.1 per cent; Q2 at 7.2 per cent; Q3 at 7.3 per cent; and Q4 at 7.2 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2025-26 is projected at 7.2 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. 9. Headline inflation increased to 5.1 per cent in June 2024 after remaining steady at 4.8 per cent during April-May 2024. Worsening of food inflation pressures \u2013 driven primarily by a sharp increase in prices of vegetables, pulses and edible oils along with a pick-up in inflation across cereals, milk, fruits and prepared meals \u2013 pushed up headline inflation. The fuel group remained in deflation, reflecting the cumulative impact of the sharp cuts in LPG price in August 2023 and March 2024. Core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation at 3.1 per cent in May-June touched a new low in the current CPI series, with core services inflation also at its lowest in the series. 10. Headline inflation has moderated from its peak but unevenly. Looking ahead, food price momentum has remained elevated in July. In Q2:2024-25, though favourable base effects are large, the sharper uptick in price momentum relative to earlier expectations is likely to result in a shallower softening of CPI headline inflation. Inflation is expected to edge up in Q3 as favourable base effects taper off. The steady progress in monsoon, pick-up in kharif sowing, adequate buffer stocks of foodgrains and easing global food prices are positives for containing food price pressures. Adverse climate events remain an upside risk to food inflation. Crude oil prices continue to be volatile on demand concerns and geopolitical tensions. The revision in mobile tariff rates is likely to lead to an increase in core inflation. Manufacturing, services and infrastructure firms surveyed by the Reserve Bank expect a pickup in selling prices in the second half of this year. Households\u2019 inflation expectations have also gone up and consumer confidence has weakened. Assuming a normal monsoon, CPI inflation for 2024-25 is projected at 4.5 per cent with Q2 at 4.4 per cent; Q3 at 4.7 per cent; and Q4 at 4.3 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2025-26 is projected at 4.4 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly balanced. 11. The MPC expects domestic growth to hold up on the strength of investment demand, steady urban consumption and rising rural consumption. Risks from volatile and elevated food prices remain high, which may adversely impact inflation expectations and result in spillovers to core inflation. There are also indications of core inflation bottoming out. Accordingly, the MPC decided to remain watchful on how these forces play out, going forward. The MPC stays resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the 4 per cent target on a durable basis. In these circumstances, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting. The MPC reiterates the need to continue with the disinflationary stance, until a durable alignment of the headline CPI inflation with the target is achieved. Enduring price stability sets strong foundations for a sustained period of high growth. Hence the MPC also considers it appropriate to continue with the disinflationary stance of withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. 12. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. 13. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target, while supporting growth. Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted for a change in stance to neutral. 14. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on August 22, 2024. 15. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during October 7 to 9, 2024. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent 16. Subsequent to the June 2024 meeting of the MPC, there is cautious optimism around the growth estimate of GDP of around 7 per cent in 2024-25. In July 2024, the Economic Survey for 2023-24 by the Ministry of India, projected a GDP growth of 6.5- 7.0 per cent for 2024-25. The IMF, in its July update of the World Economic Outlook raised India\u2019s GDP growth projection to 7 per cent from 6.8 per cent indicated in its April 2024 assessment. The latest round of RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in July 2024 presents a median forecast of 7 per cent, up from 6.8 per cent projected in May 2024. These estimates are lower than the growth estimate of 7.2 per cent provided in the MPC resolution of June meeting. The YOY real GDP growth in 2023-24 exceeded 8 per cent in the first three quarters, dropping to 7.8 per cent in Q4. In 2023-24, growth of personal consumption expenditure and exports of goods and services experienced slower growth relative to gross fixed capital formation. While a favourable south-west monsoon and lower inflation rate may support higher personal consumption growth, sustained momentum of GFCF and export growth would also be crucial for the high growth in 2024-25. 17. At the global level, IMF\u2019s WEO July 2024 Update has retained the pace of economic growth at 3.2 per cent, projected previously in April. The volume of world trade in goods and services, has been projected to rise at a marginally faster pace in 2024 than previously projected, after near stagnation in 2023. These reflect a stable external demand environment for India, although uncertainty emanating from slower than expected pace of disinflation and the geopolitical conflicts have persisted. 18. In the domestic economy, growth stimulus, particularly on investment through central government expenditure on infrastructure development has been preserved. In the central government budget for 2024-25, the budget estimate for \u2018effective capital expenditure\u2019 increased by about 20 per cent in nominal value over the provisional actuals for 2023-24, marginally higher than the increase in 2023-24 (provisional actuals) over the actual spending in the previous year. In the case of private investment, that includes corporate and household sector investment, the favourable policy incentives, emerging new opportunities in the economy and improved longer term growth prospects would be the key drivers of accelerated spending. The high frequency indicators of some of the investment activity such as consumption of finished steel and import of capital goods for April-June 2024 reflect rising level of investment activity; but output of cement in April-June and IIP for capital goods in April-May point to contraction or modest improvement. FDI inflows during April-mid July show significant increase as compared to the same period in 2023-24. The latest RBI\u2019s survey of enterprises reflects greater optimism of improved demand conditions in H2:2024-25 over H1. 19. A major push on consumption spending growth is expected to come from the improved agricultural prospects supported by a favourable monsoon this year and the moderating inflation rate. While the monsoon rainfall is expected to be at the normal level and exceeding the level in the previous year, nature of its distribution during the monsoon period and across regions would be of critical for raising agricultural sector\u2019s growth substantially from its estimated GVA growth of 1.4 per cent in 2023- 24. The sale of 2-wheelers and tractors in May-June 2024 either exceeding or matching the levels seen in the same period in 2023 is a positive indication that rural demand would be strengthened by a favourable monsoon this year. 20. The indicators of urban demand such as the number of domestic air passengers and passenger vehicle sales for April-June 2024 exceed the levels YOY basis, but the pace of growth has been lower. The pace of vehicle loans in April-June 2024 has declined, compared to the previous year but remains in double digits. The latest consumer confidence survey of urban households conducted by RBI reflects weaker sentiments. A major factor affecting both rural and urban consumption would be the moderate headline inflation rate. 21. Merchandise exports and imports registered positive growth in April-June compared to negative YOY growth in the previous year. The service exports and imports also rose in April-June this year YOY basis, although there was a decline in exports and imports in June over May. 22. The purchasing manager indices (PMIs) for manufacturing and services declined in June from a high in May but remain in expansion zone. The indicators of broader level of economic activity, GST collections, E-way bills and non-food bank credit growth at close to double digit rates YOY in April-June 2024 reflect a strong growth momentum. 23. The outlook for growth in the current year, therefore, has both the positive features that may help maintain the momentum of 2023-24 and downside risks associated with both domestic and external factors. Considering these factors, the GDP growth projection for 2024-25 has been retained at 7.2 per cent, unchanged from the June MPC meeting. The quarterly estimates for GDP in 2024-25 are 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.2 in Q1-Q4, respectively. A significant driver of growth in the current year is likely to be consumption growth. 24. Since July 2023, food inflation has remained at significantly high level compared to the other two broad components of the headline inflation. From its peak of 10.6 per cent in July 2023, food inflation (CPI for food and beverages) has declined over a 12- month period, ranging from 7.6-8.4 per cent between January and June 2024. The headline inflation has declined from 5.1 per cent in July 2023 to 4.8 per cent in May and then risen to 5.1 per cent in June 2024. A progressive decline in food inflation would be necessary to achieve the 4 per cent headline inflation which can be sustained. 25. Favourable monsoon aiding agricultural growth this year would ease the supply side pressures to bring down the prevailing high food inflation. Appropriate supply management strategies would always be needed to minimise the sharp changes in the prices of perishable commodities. The evolution of price trends in the non-food categories also need to be monitored even as the food inflation declines. The latest RBI survey of urban households reflects an upturn in 3 months- ahead and 1 year- ahead headline inflation rate, a continuation of the pattern seen in the previous round of the survey. The survey of enterprises indicates expectation of increased growth in output prices in Q2:2024-25 in the case of enterprises in the service and infrastructure sectors as the manufacturing sector, growth in selling prices is expected to ease in Q2. A \u2018Business Inflation Expectations Survey\u2019 of panel business leaders conducted in June 2024 registered a marginal uptick in the one-year ahead consumer price index, while survey also estimated a marginal decline in the cost- based one-year ahead inflation rate relative to the previous round of the survey.1 The divergence in the cost-based inflation and consumer price inflation expectations may reflect the pressures of food prices in the latter. The international food and energy prices outlook has reflected stable or downward movement but risks from geo-political conflicts disrupting supply chains are significant. Taking into account these factors, and assuming a favourable monsoon rainfall, the average headline inflation rate for 2024-25 is projected at 4.5 per cent, the same as in the MPC meeting of June. With the actual reading of 4.9 per cent inflation in Q1, projections for the remaining three quarters of 2024-25 are Q2 at 4.4 per cent, Q3 at 4.7 per cent and Q4 at 4.3 per cent. The projected headline inflation in Q1:2025-26 is at 4.4 per cent. in input cost pressures also rise. However, 26. The overall macroeconomic outlook is one of fairly strong growth and moderating inflation trend. The setting for monetary policy is, however, marked by the risks to the projected patterns of both inflation and growth. In both the cases, risks faced are common: those associated with the monsoon and climate conditions, external demand and price conditions, and financial conditions. Under a favourable monsoon and climate scenario, food inflation is expected to moderate significantly and effective supply management policies provide an effective framework to address price spikes limited to a few commodities. However, persistent food inflation may require core inflation to soften sufficiently to maintain the headline close to the target. High food inflation would therefore hit growth adversely as it affects consumption and require restrictive monetary policy to soften core inflation, especially when faced with significant spillovers of persistent food price pressures to core components. The average sequential month-over-month momentum of headline inflation is likely to be high during July-September. Therefore, at this juncture it is necessary to maintain the priority on achieving inflation target objectives. 27. Accordingly, I vote i. to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and ii. to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 28. Global uncertainties continue. The Fed in indicating a cut in its September meeting, pointed out that since monetary policy acts with a lag they can\u2019t afford to wait until they reach their inflation target before cutting. That lag may be responsible for the sharply adverse August jobs report that has stoked recession fears and created market volatility. That a series of small signals were ignored, may have led to a critical large one. Monetary policy needs to act well in time. Spillovers led the global manufacturing PMI into contraction zone in July at 49.7. 29. In India food inflation has risen, but the heat wave has had less than the expected effect, although household inflation expectations, which are sensitive to supply shocks, have risen marginally. Vegetable inflation is transient, less than last year and is already correcting with the good monsoon. Supply chains seem to be improving. That Delhi now gets tomatoes from Karnataka as well as Himachal Pradesh has reduced the price spike compared to last year. Core inflation is at 3.1% and even if it rises should get anchored at the target, especially as global commodity prices are softening. The conservative view tends to build in mean reversion, but the mean is likely to have changed. Average Indian inflation is lower and trending down. 30. Although RBI inflation projections are rising after falling due to base effects, they fall again. So the overall trend into next year is downwards. The Q1 FY26 projection is 4.4%. Many analysts expect 4% headline inflation by summer next year as the base effect and good monsoon sharply reduces food inflation, implying the expected real policy rate is 2.5%. Since Indian inflation is not well measured, and could be over or under-estimated, too much precision with regard to a target is unproductive. 31. An EM is subject to many shocks, so it is better if forward guidance on rates is data-based, communicating only the reaction function. Even so, lags in action imply it is necessary to be forward-looking and take decisions based on expected future variables. 32. A view sometimes expressed is that government actions affect growth, not those of central banks (CBs). But then why would the MPC have growth as an objective? Since growth in economies in transition especially, is non-steady state and non- linear, excess monetary tightening can trigger a switch to a lower growth path so that the growth sacrifice is large. 33. There are some negative signals for Indian growth also. Early results of listed private manufacturing companies show sales and profits softened in Q1 FY25. Consumer confidence fell and the business expectations index has been moderating since Q4 FY24. The RBI Q1 FY25 growth forecast has been reduced. 34. Overall Indian growth is resilient, but it is still below potential. The Q1 FY25 softening in government expenditure was an election phenomenon and will reverse, while the good monsoon is likely to reverse the heat wave related softening in consumer expenditure. 35. Many experts had expected India to revert to low pre-pandemic growth. But growth has been robust at an average of 8.3% for 3 years now\u2014this is beyond base effects. Something is different, including macroeconomic policy, which effectively smoothed shocks. Rising diversity and scale have also increased shock absorbing capacity. 36. Since this is my last MPC meeting I would like to record here my appreciation of policy-making in this period that helped India overcome major external shocks and set it on a path of high growth with stability. It was a privilege to watch its working from close quarters. 37. But continued vigilance is the price of success. I will flag some of the principles (marked P) that in my view were responsible for outperformance and the risks in departing from these. 38. Real variables were kept near equilibrium. This is an indicator of countercyclical smoothing of shocks (P1). Large deviations of real rates can make growth volatile, as happened in the 2010s. 39. Another major factor that worked well for India in the last 3 years was good monetary-fiscal coordination (P2). The budget shows a conservative fiscal deficit target overachieved, infrastructure spending maintained and other ongoing supply- side improvements (P3) that will reduce inflation currently as well as over time. These are essential for non-inflationary growth in India. Of course, it is always possible to do more and further raise potential output. In particular, it is important to shift from interventions that distort resource allocation to those that improve productivity in agriculture. 40. With fiscal policy doing its part, monetary policy must also keep the repo rate as low as is consistent with reaching the inflation target. It is not that reforms must come before monetary action. In a dynamic economy both can act together. This type of coordination is compatible with CB independence and credible anchoring of inflation expectations (P4) since action is conditional on inflation outcomes. 41. Svensson had warned long ago that flexibility (P5) in inflation targeting (IT) is very important for its social acceptance.2 Interest rates affect many groups in opposing ways. A low positive repo is also called for since it balances (P6) these differing interests. It worked well in the last few years also reducing core inflation to historic lows. Deviations can lead to protests in a democracy and eventually dilute IT and undermine coordination. As the real repo rises, we are beginning to see such comments, for example in the current Economic Survey. 42. This is unfortunate since the inflation target can serve as a fair benchmark for contesting groups. Trend inflation in any sector should not rise above the target, although spikes can be looked through as expectations remain anchored. Those proposing a higher trend price rise should, in time, become aware that as aggregate inflation rises real gains tend to be lost. 43. There is a view that the neutral real policy rate (NIR) rises with growth. But this holds only for departures from steady-state growth and need not apply if higher transitional growth is absorbing hitherto excluded workers with low productivity and consumption.3 The other important country-relevant issue that a current estimation must include is falling risk premia (P7) due to fiscal, monetary and regulatory actions that are reducing levels and spreads in interest rates. For example, lower volatility in the FX market is reducing interest differentials required with the rest of the world. 44. A clear counter-factual to conservative estimations based on methods developed for advanced economies (AEs) is China, whose sustained high catch-up growth was supported by low real interest rates. 45. With a few exceptions market analysts that are most articulate about policy rates are mainly interested in the nominal level and its changes in order to guide their clients\u2019 market positions. They will accept any estimate of NIR policy-makers give them, since commitment to a NIR value helps them make predictions. 46. The real rate affects the real sector. It is the MPC, whose mandate covers all groups, that has to be concerned about \u2018correct\u2019 real rates in order to balance interests, respond to pressing priorities and seize opportunities. The first priority for India is to create more productive jobs in order to utilize the demographic dividend as well as to prevent possible political instability. 47. Even if growth is high, it has to rise to its full potential. A falling trend and low core inflation indicates growth is below potential,4 implying real rates are above the NIR and there is scope to reduce the repo rate and raise growth. This simple guide cuts through complexities in the estimation of NIR. The MPC must make sure, if the approach to target is long and slow, the real policy rate does not deviate too far from the NIR during that period. 48. Credit eventually creates deposits through rising incomes and savings, but in the meanwhile banks should maintain adequate liquidity buffers. We are seeing market rates coming down as liquidity improves with government spending. The call money rate is also near the repo rate. This should be maintained. Adequate liquidity is required along with prudential policies that create good incentives for the financial sector (P8), especially since the sources of liquidity are limited for many parts of India\u2019s financial sector leading to liquidity hoarding. Balance requires that over- strictness is avoided. 49. In view of the above arguments I vote for a 25 bps cut in the repo rate and a change in the stance to neutral. These are necessary to lower risks of departure from the principles outlined above, which have contributed to policy successes in the last 3 years. 50. For the last several meetings, I have been expressing concerns about the unacceptable growth sacrifice induced by a monetary policy that is excessively restrictive. The majority of the MPC however do not share this concern, perhaps because they think that the Indian economy is already growing at close to its potential growth rate. I think that such a view reflects (a) an unwarranted pessimism about the growth potential of the economy and (b) an overly sanguine expectation about growth in ensuing quarters. I disagree with both prongs of this assessment. 51. Multiple policy measures during the last few years including digitalization, tax reforms, and a step up in infrastructure investment have in my view boosted the potential growth rate of the Indian economy to at least 8 per cent. A confluence of demographic and economic factors present India with a rare opportunity to accelerate its growth over the next decade or more. It is one of the tasks of monetary policy to ensure that this opportunity is not squandered by excessively high real interest rates. In this context it is depressing that India\u2019s projected growth rates for 2024-25 and 2025-26 (despite being among the highest growth rates of any large economy in the world), are significantly lower than the potential growth rate of the Indian economy, 4 There is a literature that uses realized inflation to estimate potential growth, for example, Svensson, L. E.O. Woodford, M. 2003. \u2018Indicator variables for optimal policy\u2019, Journal of Monetary Economics, Volume 50, Issue 3, Pages 691-720. and also well below what is needed at the current stage of our demographic transition to meet the aspirations of the new entrants into the workforce. 52. At the same time, the majority of the MPC is, in my view, too sanguine about growth in ensuing quarters. Data from various RBI surveys show multiple early warning signals that growth may be already slowing down. Expectations of robust growth depend heavily on an expectation that private capital investment will pick up soon. However, we have been hoping for this revival for many quarters now, and hope is not a strategy. 53. The RBI\u2019s projections show inflation bouncing up and down from quarter to quarter, but the trend line is clearly downward, and the projected inflation for the first quarter of 2025-26 is 4.4 per cent. On a forward looking basis, the current repo rate of 6.5 per cent translates into a real rate of 2.1 per cent. This is well above what is needed to drive inflation to the target of 4 per cent. It is true that disinflation has been protracted, and therefore restrictive monetary policy has to be maintained for a few more quarters. But a real interest rate of 1.5 per cent is sufficiently restrictive in this environment. This means that a reduction of over 50 basis points in the repo rate is needed within a short span of time, but it makes sense to move cautiously in this direction. I therefore vote to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points, and to change the stance to neutral. Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan 54. Since the last monetary policy committee meeting, risks to the global economic outlook have increased, while the domestic economy continue to exhibit resilience. Domestically, risks to inflation are higher than risks to growth at the margin. Let me elaborate on each of these. though Q1:2024-25 growth projections have been slightly revised 55. Even downwards, I am now more confident of overall growth holding up in 2024-25 mainly on three counts. First, consumption, which was lagging during 2023-24 will recover in the current year led by rural consumption on the back of better progress of the monsoon, higher sowing and moderating inflation. Higher FMCG sales in the rural areas during the last two quarters bears testimony to this trend. Second, the Union Budget 2024-25 is growth positive with provisions for higher capital and revenue expenditure. Capital expenditure is budgeted to grow by 17.1 per cent (on top of 28.2 per cent in 2023-24), while revenue expenditure excluding interest payments and subsidies is budgeted to grow by 7.4 per cent (1.2 per cent last year) with an absolute increase of about \u20b982,244 crore from the Interim Budget estimates. Fiscal consolidation via higher receipts and medium-term debt reduction path as envisaged in the budget will be growth positive in the long run.5 Third, investment activity is picking up as witnessed from improving capacity utilisation, pick up in investment intentions, and continued buoyancy in steel consumption and capital goods imports. Strong FDI flows at the start of the year are also positive from capex cycle viewpoint. Thus, the growth of the Indian economy is likely to be sustained by all growth drivers working in tandem. The large divergence between gross value added (GVA) and GDP growth is expected to narrow down substantially in the current fiscal as central government subsidies are budgeted to contract moderately compared to a large contraction seen in the previous year. 56. On the other hand, inflation outlook remains uncertain. The upturn in headline inflation in June to 5.1 per cent has been on account of a substantial pick-up in price momentum to around 1.3 per cent (from 0.5 per cent in May) though it was considerably offset by a favourable base effect of around 1.1 per cent. The surge in headline CPI price momentum was driven by the food component even as core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation collapsed to a new low in the current CPI series. High frequency food price indicators point to continuing strong food price momentum in July, though large favourable base effects are likely to more than offset it leading to a softening in inflation. Further, core inflation has also likely bottomed out in June, primarily as the impact of the mobile-tariff revision is likely to get reflected in CPI core inflation numbers in July. As a result, there has been changes to the quarterly path of inflation projections with Q2 projections being revised upwards, even as full year CPI inflation projection has been retained at 4.5 per cent. 57. In the recent period, food inflation has remained persistently elevated, averaging 8 per cent since July 2023 and has contributed to around 75 per cent of the headline inflation during April-June 2024. Such persistent food inflation pressures cannot be ignored considering the high share of food in household consumption basket and risk of its spillovers to non-food core CPI components. In this scenario, monetary policy should continue to remain actively disinflationary to ensure that inflation and inflation expectations remains durably aligned to the target rate. 58. The old debate of \u2018core versus headline\u2019 that was well settled when in 2016 we had adopted the flexible inflation targeting framework with headline as our target in line with international best practices has resurfaced with persistent divergence between food inflation that has remained elevated and subdued core inflation.6 As long as food constitutes an important segment of the consumer basket and food inflation shows signs of persistence, one cannot ignore food in the CPI basket given the common perception of households to look at food prices while evaluating inflation. Moreover, the likely indirect spill overs from the interrelation of prices over time and across sectors for both households and firms remains important.7 Recent cross-country evidence indicates an increase in the size and significance of inflation persistence post pandemic, thus, slowing down the disinflation journey even after energy price shocks and supply disruptions have abated.8 All this complicates the central bankers\u2019 task and demands caution in policy conduct. Any adjustment of the goalpost, apart from undermining central bank\u2019s hard-earned credibility, may have to bear the wrath of the markets, thus wiping out all the good work done so far. 59. Developments on the global front further add to the uncertainty as the outlook is evolving at a fast pace amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions and various data releases leading to changing perceptions about global economic prospects adding to financial market volatility. Some countries have embarked on easing cycle as their growth has started exhibiting withering signs and headline inflation has started softening, despite core inflation ruling above the headline inflation. On the other hand, a few countries are waiting for supply shocks to abate and favourable economic conditions to emerge before pivoting towards a rate cut cycle, despite low core inflation. There is also a third set of countries that are hiking their benchmark rates due to their country-specific factors. Under these circumstances, it is important that we define our own policy path based on prevailing domestic growth-inflation 6 For details, please refer Report of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework (Chairman: U.R. Patel, January 2014). 7 The Pass-Through from Inflation Perceptions to Inflation Expectations by Stefanie Huber, Daria Minina, Tobias Schmidt :: SSRN (August 2023); How euro area firms\u2019 inflation expectations affect their business decisions (europa.eu) (July 2024) 8 https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3562 (July 2024) dynamics. We cannot let down our guards against inflation at this juncture, when supply shocks are proving to be so persistent. 60. Going ahead, however, some positive developments are envisaged. Headline CPI inflation is projected to continue on the disinflation path towards the target rate, though gradually, with inflation projections indicating a significant moderation by Q4 of the financial year. Steady progress in monsoon with a favourable La Nina; higher kharif sowing; a likely favourable rabi season on the back of good soil moisture conditions; and softening global food prices may lead to a more than anticipated decline in food inflation pressures over the course of the year. This could open up the window for monetary policy to change its course. At the current juncture, however, more clarity and definiteness are needed - on food inflation outlook; spillovers of food price pressures to core inflation; domestic demand; and global risks. Till then, I will prefer to stay the course and remain cautious and watchful for these uncertainties to play out. Resilient growth gives us the space to remain focussed on inflation and maintain status quo till some of these risks are mitigated and the trade-offs are minimised. Accordingly, I vote for status quo on both stance and rate in this policy. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 61. The wedge between headline and food inflation has been widening, and stalling the alignment of the former with the target. Taking into account double digit inflation in salient food categories such as cereals, pulses, spices and vegetables for several months, empirical evidence points to a rise in the time varying persistence of food inflation, i.e., it is taking longer to revert to its trend after a shock. There is also evidence of the time varying trend of food inflation increasing, negating the gains made through core disinflation. 62. Higher trend food inflation is spilling over into inflation expectations of households and consumer confidence. In the case of the former, even their current perceptions have now started rising along with outer-term expectations. The recent assessment of the neutral rate of interest suggests that the disinflationary stance of monetary policy is appropriate, especially in view of the persisting positive gap between actual inflation outcomes and the target. Potential output is now rising faster than its pre- pandemic pace; even so, a positive output gap has opened up \u2013 actual output is running ahead of potential output - warranting vigil on aggregate demand developments. 63. Monetary policy is an instrument for modulating aggregate demand. Food price shocks may originate outside the realm of monetary policy and initially manifest themselves in supply mismatches, but when their effects stay in the inflation formation process, they can propagate through second order effects and get generalised to which monetary policy cannot be insensitive. Persistently rising prices are always and everywhere a reflection of too much demand chasing too less supply even if it is a supply shortfall that starts the price spiral. It is the remit of monetary policy to adjust demand conditions to the state of supply because this accumulation of price pressures threatens the outlook for both inflation and growth. The monetary policy committee (MPC) of the RBI has committed to align inflation durably to the target. That is not yet achieved; any faltering from this commitment could undermine the prospects of the Indian economy. Hence, I vote for keeping the policy rate and the stance of withdrawal of accommodation unchanged in this resolution. 64. Global economic activity has remained stable since the last meeting of the MPC in June 2024. Incoming data, however, presents a mixed picture with signs of slowing growth momentum in certain major economies. Inflation is on a softening path, but persistence in services prices is imparting downward rigidity. With changing growth- inflation dynamics, several central banks have become less restrictive by way of rate cuts and forward guidance. At the same time, there are a few others who have hiked their interest rates. Market expectations are constantly varying on the pace and timing of policy pivots by central banks, resulting in financial market volatility. 65. In this mixed global backdrop, India is treading on a steady growth path driven primarily by domestic factors. High frequency indicators suggest that momentum of activity witnessed during Q4:2023-24 continued during Q1:2024-25, though with some slowdown in corporate profits, lower general government expenditure and core industries output. Kharif sowing is progressing well thanks to the south-west monsoon. Improving reservoir levels augur well for the rabi output. Manufacturing and services activity remain buoyant. 66. The pickup in agricultural activity is expected to further boost rural consumption. Urban consumption continues to be steady. Budget allocation for government capex remains robust. Private corporate investment is also gaining steam with capacity utilisation reaching its highest level in 11 years. Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates provide a congenial environment for private sector investments to gather pace. Indications of capacity creation in a few industries and growing investment intentions are getting visible.9 Improving global trade volume is expected to provide support to external demand. 67. Since the last bi-monthly policy review, headline inflation has seen upward movement in June to 5.1 per cent, as food inflation pressures increased and offset the impact of subdued core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation and deflation in the fuel group. 68. Going forward, headline inflation in July and Q2 of the current financial year are expected to be lower, given their base effect advantage; but with food inflation pressures showing little signs of abatement in the near-term, and household inflation expectations picking up, monetary policy has to remain vigilant to potential spillovers of food price pressures to the core components. This is critical for the \u2018last mile of disinflation\u2019 and anchoring of inflation expectations. Food inflation may soften due to good monsoon, steady improvement in kharif sowing, rising reservoir levels and a likely favourable rabi season output. Uncertainty, however, comes from frequent recurrence of adverse weather events, resurgence of geo-political tensions and financial market volatility. Further, core inflation might just have bottomed out. 69. The calibrated increase in policy repo rate by 250 basis points since May 2022 and subsequent change of stance to withdrawal of accommodation has facilitated gradual disinflation over 2022-23. With a forecast of 4.5 per cent headline inflation for 2024-25, the present policy repo rate is broadly in balance and avoids costly sacrifice of domestic economic activity. 70. At this stage, when durable disinflation to the target is still a work in progress, the issue of equilibrium natural interest rate is premature. Policy making in the real world cannot be based on an abstract, theoretical and model specific construct which is unobservable and time varying. Hence, any justification for policy easing based on so called high real rates can be misleading. 71. Introduction of flexible inflation targeting (FIT) in 2016 was a major structural reform. Over the last 8 years, it has gained in credibility and facilitated positive outcomes for the economy, despite the huge global shocks. Its credibility needs to be preserved and sustained. 72. Inflation is gradually trending down, but the pace is slow and uneven. Durable alignment of inflation to the target of 4.0 per cent is still some distance away. Persistent food inflation is imparting stickiness to headline inflation. Inflation expectations need to be kept anchored. Spillovers of food inflation to core have to be avoided. At such a crucial juncture, steady growth impulses are allowing monetary policy to unambiguously focus on supporting a sustained descent of inflation to the target. The best contribution that monetary policy can make for sustainable growth is to maintain price stability. Taking all these factors into consideration, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent and continuing with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. ", "file9": "The fifty first meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during October 7 to 9, 2024. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Nagesh Kumar, Director and Chief Executive, Institute for Studies in Industrial Development, New Delhi; Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Economist, Mumbai; Professor Ram Singh, Director, Delhi School of Economics, Delhi; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. for 5. After assessing the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (October 9, 2024) decided to: Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to change the monetary policy stance to \u2018neutral\u2019 and to remain unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. 6. The global economy has remained resilient and is expected to maintain stable momentum over the rest of the year, amidst downside risks from intensifying geopolitical conflicts. In India, real gross domestic product (GDP) registered a growth of 6.7 per cent in Q1:2024-25, driven by private consumption and investment. Looking ahead, the agriculture sector is expected to perform well on the back of above normal rainfall and robust reservoir levels, while manufacturing and services activities remain steady. On the demand side, healthy kharif sowing, coupled with sustained momentum in consumer spending in the festival season, augur well for private consumption. Consumer and business confidence have improved. The investment outlook is supported by resilient non-food bank credit growth, elevated capacity utilisation, healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, and the government\u2019s continued thrust on infrastructure spending. External demand is expected to get support from improving global trade volumes. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2024-25 is projected at 7.2 per cent with Q2 at 7.0 per cent; Q3 at 7.4 per cent; and Q4 at 7.4 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2025-26 is projected at 7.3 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. 7. Headline inflation declined sharply to 3.6 and 3.7 per cent in July and August respectively from 5.1 per cent in June. Going forward, the September inflation print may see a significant pick-up as base effects turn adverse and food prices register an upturn. Food inflation, however, is expected to ease by Q4:2024-25 on better kharif arrivals and rising prospects of a good rabi season. Sowing of key kharif crops are higher than last year and the long-period average. Sufficient buffer stocks for cereals are available for ensuring food security. Adequate reservoir levels, the likelihood of a good winter and favorable soil moisture conditions augur well for the ensuing rabi season, though adverse weather events remain a risk. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank enterprise surveys expect input cost pressures to ease; however, the very recent upturn in key commodity prices, especially metals and crude oil needs to be closely monitored. Taking all these factors into consideration, CPI inflation for 2024- 25 is projected at 4.5 per cent with Q2 at 4.1 per cent; Q3 at 4.8 per cent; and Q4 at 4.2 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2025-26 is projected at 4.3 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly balanced. 8. The MPC noted that the domestic growth outlook remains resilient supported by domestic drivers \u2013 private consumption and investment. This provides headroom for monetary policy to focus on the goal of attaining a durable alignment of inflation with the target. The MPC reiterates that enduring price stability strengthens the foundations of a sustained period of high growth. After a transient spike in the near term, headline inflation is expected to moderate as projected above. With better prospects for both kharif and rabi crops and ample buffer stocks of foodgrains, there is now greater confidence on the disinflation path later in the financial year. Keeping in view the prevailing and expected inflation-growth dynamics, which are well balanced, the MPC decided to change the monetary policy stance from withdrawal of accommodation to \u2018neutral\u2019 and remain unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target, while supporting growth. The change in stance provides flexibility to the MPC while enabling it to monitor the progress on disinflation which is still incomplete. Risks stem from uncertainties relating to heightened global geo-political risks, financial market volatility, adverse weather events and the recent uptick in global food and metal prices. Hence, the MPC has to remain vigilant of the evolving inflation outlook. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting. 9. Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Professor Ram Singh, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Dr. Nagesh Kumar voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. 10. Dr. Nagesh Kumar, Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Professor Ram Singh, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a change in stance from withdrawal of accommodation to \u2018neutral\u2019 and to remain unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target, while supporting growth. 11. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on October 23, 2024. 12. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during December 4 to 6, 2024. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent 13. At the outset, I must say, that looking at the global economic situation, one feels proud of the management of the Indian economy that has made it the fastest-growing large economy globally, with a relatively low inflation rate, exchange rate stability, large foreign exchange reserves, among other robust macroeconomic fundamentals. The effective monetary management by the RBI combined with the prudent fiscal management by the Finance Ministry over the years deserve to be applauded. 14. Within the broad overall picture, zooming in to the current juncture, however, certain pointers require consideration by the MPC. I wish to situate the discussion on the policy rates and inflation targeting in the context of the overall development priorities of the country from the perspective of the real sector, particularly the manufacturing sector. After all, the policies are the \u2018means\u2019 for achieving the \u2018ends\u2019 that are our development aspirations. 15. The job creation imperative for India\u2019s youthful population has pushed the Government to focus attention on the manufacturing sector which has the potential to create decent jobs not only directly but also indirectly, especially for semi-skilled and unskilled workers. Several reforms and policy measures such as PLI have been taken over the past decade as a part of the \u2018Make-in-India\u2019. India is not alone in pushing the manufacturing sector. The US, until recently the greatest champion of free markets, for instance, is pushing industrial policy aggressively with a trinity of the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and the Science Act, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act adopted in 2022 which have collectively put more than a trillion dollars on the table to be handed out to industry in incentives and tax breaks, besides heavy tariffs imposed on the imports from China to protect the domestic industry. The EU is following the same playbook. 16. The external context for pursuing industrial policy, however, has turned less benign compared to the 1990s and early part of the 2000s when China\u2019s industrial policy was supported by rapidly expanding world trade and investments. World trade and investments have never quite recovered from the global financial crisis and their growth rates have come down dramatically from an annual average of over 16% to under 4% for world trade and from around 20% to just 2% for FDI between the pre- and post-GFC periods. The rise of protectionism in the West, trade wars, and the collapse of multilateral into trade negotiations have \u2018slowbalization.\u2019 The situation is complicated further, especially for India, by large excess industrial capacities sitting next door in China, with access to the Western markets made more difficult, and the threat of predatory dumping in our markets is real. 17. The disruptions during the pandemic have sparked a trend of global companies derisking their supply chains by restructuring them on a China+1 basis. This trend of restructuring of supply chains by global companies could be an opportunity for India to attract investments to build our productive capacities if we can get our act together in terms of investment climate, efficient logistics, stable macroeconomic environment, cost of capital, and overall cost of doing business vis-a-vis peer countries. To some extent, India\u2019s success in attracting Apple and its vendors like Foxconn to assemble iPhones in India is a part of this trend. 18. The emerging trends in the Indian economy suggest a slowdown of the economic growth from 8.2% in 2023-24 to 6.7% in 2024-25:Q1 and the projection for the full year 2024-25, according to the Survey of Professional Forecasters, has been revised down by 10 basis points to 6.9%. The core sectors such as cement, iron & steel, and chemicals showing negative growth over the past two quarters despite a rather heavy infrastructure push by the government through unprecedented capital expenditure since 2023-24 is a matter of concern. The cost of finance of private companies has gone up steadily since March 2022 when the RBI started to raise the policy rates. According to the Enterprise Surveys, the demand conditions in manufacturing and the job landscape moderated across major sectors. The Consumer Confidence Surveys suggest that the general economic conditions have worsened compared to a year ago. Overall business sentiment has moderated in 2024-25:Q2. PMI for manufacturing eased somewhat in September although stayed in the expansionary zone. All these trends point to the weaknesses in demand in the domestic economy in general, and industry in particular. Similarly, India\u2019s merchandise exports have shrunk by 9.3% in August due to subdued demand abroad. The April-August growth of merchandize exports has been just a marginal 1.1% only. 19. Therefore, the Indian industry is clearly suffering from demand deficits in both domestic and external markets. Demand deficits may be the reason private investment has not picked up momentum despite the companies' healthy balance sheets and all the reforms and incentives extended by the government. 20. The inflationary trends, on the other hand, suggest that the monetary policy interventions of RBI have had greater success in managing inflation. The CPI headline has been around 4.5%, and was slightly lower at 3.6% in July-August 2024. The inflation excluding vegetables is even lower at 3.2% (July-August). Food inflation especially cereals and vegetables has been challenging but it is driven by cyclical supply side issues rather than demand which is addressed by monetary policy. Household inflationary expectations/ perceptions have declined by 10 basis points. A lower proportion of households expect prices and inflation to increase over 3 or 12 months ahead. Therefore, it is apparent that the policy tightening by the RBI has succeeded in anchoring inflationary expectations well. 21. Furthermore, several industrialized and emerging economies have started to cut interest rates to revive economic growth. In the US, the Fed has cut the policy rate by 50 basis points. The EU, Switzerland, Mexico, China, and South Africa have begun to normalize monetary policy by cutting rates. India risks currency appreciation if we do not follow the process of normalization. The rupee has been already appreciating in real terms and a further appreciation would hurt the competitiveness of Indian products. 22. Given that inflationary expectations have been successfully anchored, and industrial demand in both domestic as well as export markets is flagging, a rate cut could help to revive demand and help boost private investment. I believe that it is an opportune moment for RBI to start the process of normalizing the monetary policy. In view of these observations, I vote for a 25 basis point cut in the repo rate and the adoption of a neutral stance in the monetary policy. 23. Global growth, while resilient, remains uneven, slowing in many large economies, prompting central banks to start cutting policy rates. Prospects for future demand remain hazy, with each emerging data point seeming to present a confusing and occasionally dissonant outlook. The forthcoming IMF World Economic Outlook is awaited for forecast updates. Future G-7 central banks\u2019 rate actions and guidance, other than affecting economic activity, are likely to induce financial markets volatility, with expected spillovers to emerging markets. 24. In India, signals on growth momentum present a mixed picture, with uncertainty regarding aggregate demand. RBI projects a 7.2% real GDP growth for FY25. to be Forecasts of many progressively converging closer to this. institutional and multilateral organisations seem 25. In the near term, however, some high frequency economic indicators (both hard data and surveys) suggest a loss of momentum, but still do not seem to show a material slowdown. The Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers Indices (PMIs) for September, and the IIM Ahmedabad August Business Expectations Survey show a moderation in current and expected activity metrics. Lower cement and steel growth are a concern, but might partially reflect the base effects of very high growth rates in the corresponding months in FY24. Domestic IT hiring is reported to have slowed. The much-discussed slowdown in Personal Vehicles (PV) retail sales, with reported large inventory stocks at dealers, is a concern. The last reported prints for rural wages remain subdued. Tepid export growth is worrisome, accentuated by reports of China \u201cdumping\u201d excess capacity. 26. A contrarian viewpoint is equally compelling. RBI surveys show increasing consumer confidence, Two-wheeler sales are doing well, particularly in rural areas. Tailwinds from the largely good rains are likely to bolster rural demand. Steel consumption recorded double digit year on year growth during April \u2013 August 20241. The automobile dealerships\u2019 industry body notes that expectations of higher PV sales in October have improved. Manufacturing Capacity Utilisation (CU), seasonally adjusted, had inched up in Q1 FY25, auguring well for private sector investment. A study on banks\u2019 capex sanctions and disbursements in FY24 reinforces this2. Although dated, RBI collation of non-financial private listed corporate Q1 FY25 results show that high interest rates have not hurt corporate financials to any significant extent; interest costs as a share of sales were actually creeping lower (2.7% in Q1 FY25). Retail credit, conjectured (albeit untested) to be a driver of consumption demand, while slowing, still remains robust. Weighing these metrics, we assess that domestic growth outlook remains largely resilient, even as we recognise the need to closely monitor developments in near term economic indicators. 27. Inflation, on the other hand, appears to be more stable now. Persistent high food inflation might gradually trend down, given the relatively good distribution of above average rains and higher acreage sown. High reservoir levels and ground moisture augur well for rabi crops. Excluding vegetables, CPI inflation has remained below 4% for the past 8 months. All synthetic measures of core inflation have remained stable despite persistent and overlapping food price shocks. Diffusion indices of price dispersion for CPI Core also indicated a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (saar) price momentum of less than 4 to 6 per cent3. Yet, the September CPI inflation is likely to be significantly higher than in the last couple of months. Although we expect 1 Indian Steel Industry: August 2024, Joint Plant Committee, Ministry of Steel. 2 K. Gupta et al, RBI Bulletin August 2024, pp. 149-162. 3 RBI Monetary Policy Report, October 2024. this likely rise to be transitory over a couple of months, we need to closely monitor trends in commodities prices. The arduous battle against inflation is far from won, but we are more confident of eventual success in bringing CPI inflation durably closer to the target. One important reason for this confidence is that household inflation expectations remain well anchored and have trended lower in the latest survey round. 28. Yet, risks on commodities inflation seem to be building up. The FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) was up 2.1% yoy in September \u201824. Geopolitical risks have risen sharply. Most metals prices had hitherto remained moderate, largely due to the China slowdown, but now some metals prices, particularly aluminium, are trending up. The magnitude and contours of China\u2019s ongoing stimulus and their impact on Chinese demand still remain unclear. A study which had estimated India\u2019s potential output growth at 7% for January-March 20244 reinforces the heightened risks of premature easing. 29. Given this assessment, risks to the near-term growth \u2013 inflation trade-off at this point in time seem largely balanced, even as inflation is projected to be trending towards the target and is eventually likely to durably align with it. The effects of the current uncertainty on the evolving and fluid economic conditions need to be understood in greater detail in order to guide policy actions at this inflexion point. However, the extent of ambiguity emanating from economic signals warrants a need for policy to be able to respond readily to evolving economic conditions, based on incoming data. The first step is to change the policy stance to neutral, providing flexibility and optionality for future actions. 30. It needs to be emphasized, given the current heightened uncertainty, both global and domestic, that a very cautious and calibrated approach to easing is called for; the costs of a \u201cpolicy error\u201d are likely to be large. The multi-dimensional implications of a repo rate cut at this time and in the future needs careful evaluation. One of these might be a further and excessive easing of financial conditions; these conditions, to an extent, have already in the recent past resulted in a de facto easing of restrictive policy. In addition, structural system liquidity has shifted over time from deficit to surplus, helping to anchor overnight and short-term rates close to the repo rate. Updates inter alia on the ongoing festive season sales and the results of listed private sector corporates for the July-September quarter of FY25 might provide more clarity on evolving demand conditions. 31. Accordingly, based on my assessment of the appropriate response to this complex economic environment, I vote for a change of the monetary policy stance to neutral while keeping the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent. 32. The macroeconomic data and indicators available so far suggest that domestic economic activity remains steady. The real GDP has grown by 6.7 per cent in Q1:2024-25, a tad less than the projected value for the quarter. The GVA, on the other hand, expanded by 6.8 per cent in Q1 of 2024-25, higher than 6.3 per cent in the previous quarter. The core of production, i.e., manufacturing and services, grew by 7.0 per cent and 7.7 per cent, respectively, and drove the growth of GVA primarily in Q1. The data also suggest that a revival in private consumption and improvement 4 H. K. Behera, \u201cUpdating Estimates of the Natural Rate of Interest for India with Post Pandemic Evidence\u201d, RBI Bulletin, July 2024, pp. 77-88. in private investment has driven the growth in the first quarter. The GFCF has stood at 7.5 per cent in Q1:2024-25. It is also noteworthy that the investment as a share of the GDP has reached 34.8 per cent \u2013 the highest since Q2:2012-13. 33. The agriculture and services sectors remain resilient. Better kharif sowing owing to the above-normal monsoon rainfall is expected to help sustain the growth path. The improved reservoir levels and soil moisture conditions also augur well for the ensuing rabi crop. The services sector has continued to grow at a steady pace. PMI services at 57.7 in September indicate robust expansion though the pace slackened to a 10-month low in September as demand slowed. 34. The eight core industries' output fell by 1.8 per cent in August on an adverse base. Excess rainfall also dampened production in some sectors, such as electricity, coal and cement, in August. This comes in the backdrop of a tapering trend in the PMI over the last few months. However, PMI remains in expansion territory with a comfortable margin, and India has continued to record the highest PMI reading among major economies for manufacturing and services since July 2022 and April 2023, respectively. Also, the industrial outlook survey of manufacturing firms suggests improved expectations for production, order books, employment, capacity utilisation, and overall business situation during Q4:2024-25 and Q1:2025-26. Moreover, improving domestic demand with lower commodities and other input costs is conducive to the sustainability of manufacturing activities. On the external front, recent merchandise exports have contracted, but services exports support overall growth. 35. Regarding demand, PFCE growth has shown a moderate but consistent upward trajectory. It accelerated to a seven-quarter high of 7.4 per cent in Q1:2024-25. Rural demand is trending upwards, as manifested by several vital indicators: sales of two- wheelers during July-August 2024, a 16.6 per cent decline in demand for the MGNREGA work during July-September, and a higher growth of FMCG in rural areas. The sale of consumer durables and air traffic manifests a sustained urban demand. 36. Investment also remains buoyant, as indicated by steel consumption, production, and imports of capital goods. The GFCE is moderately improving after a 0.2 percent contraction during Q1:2024-25. Government capex from the contraction observed in the first quarter due to general elections. Government expenditures of the centre and the states are expected to pick up further pace in Q3 and Q4. The government\u2019s continued thrust on capex and healthy twin-balance sheets would help sustain business optimism. is also rebounding 37. An expansion in non-food bank credit for most manufacturing and infrastructure subsectors is sustaining private investment. An increase in the seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation\u2014from 74.6 per cent in Q4:2023-24 to 75.8 per cent in Q1:2024- 25\u2014also adds to the positive outlook, as does a rise in investment intentions. A downtrend in finished goods inventory (FGI)/sales and steady raw material inventory (RMI)/sales are also a source of comfort. 38. In the rest of the fiscal year, growth will also depend on whether government spending in the remaining two quarters remains in line with the budget estimates, the growth rate for the core industries, and the growth in the flow of financial resources to the commercial sector. 39. However, fundamental growth drivers and the mainstay of aggregate demand \u2013 investment demand \u2013 are gaining momentum. The core consumption and components of aggregate demand, viz., private consumption and gross fixed capital formation, have remained strong with over 7.0 per cent growth in Q1, suggesting resilience of looks sustainable on the back of improved agricultural outlook and rural demand. Sustained buoyancy in services is also expected to support urban demand. The high-frequency indicators point toward a sustained momentum in domestic economic activity. Overall, the real GDP growth for 2024-25 is projected at 7.2 per cent, which seems very much achievable. 40. The headline CPI inflation rate was below 4.0 per cent for the second consecutive month in August 2024. This is very comforting, especially given the core inflation readings remaining in the range of 3.3-3.4 per cent during this period. The fuel component of CPI remains in a contractionary phase. The RBI projected CPI inflation for 2024-25 at 4.5 per cent, with balanced risks. 41. Food inflation is an important source of uncertainty, which has increased in August from the preceding month. Moreover, there is a significant divergence within the food sub-groups. Going forward, the moderation in headline inflation can be unsteady in the near term due to adverse base effects. Food inflation is expected to moderate later this financial year because of strong kharif and rabi sowing on top of adequate buffer stocks. Adverse weather events, however, remain un-insurable risks to food inflation. 42. Considering all these factors, there is a case for remaining vigilant about food inflation and, at the same time, supporting growth. Therefore, I vote for: unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Keeping the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)  Changing the monetary policy stance to \u2018neutral\u2019. 43. In my August 2024 statement, I had stated that we could see a window opening up for monetary policy to change its course backed by steady progress in monsoon, higher kharif sowing, favourable rabi prospects and softening global commodity prices. Today, we have more clarity and definiteness on some of these aspects, all of which may contribute positively to our disinflation path. 44. There is ample evidence now to say that monetary policy actions since May 2022 have worked well. First, inflation expectations have come down significantly since September 2022, when they had reached a peak. Since September 2022, current perception, 3-month and 1-year ahead household inflation expectations declined by 210 bps, 160 bps and 100 bps, respectively, while business inflation expectations5 have seen a decline of 104 bps over these last two years. Second, core inflation has softened from a 6 per cent level during May to September 2022 to around 3.2 per cent during the current financial year. Third, the cumulative rate hikes have percolated through the system adequately, broadly in line with the transmission observed during the easing phase. Fourth, beyond the near-term hump, inflation projections during the latter part of the financial year give us comfort with food 5 As per the monthly Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. inflation likely to benefit from strong kharif sowing, adequate buffer stocks and likely good soil moisture conditions for rabi sowing. 45. Fifth, policy rate hikes since May 2022 along with the prudential measure of increasing the risk weights for certain unsecured loan segments undertaken in November 2023 helped lower credit growth in the targeted sectors. Thus, prudential measures \u2013 whether ahead of or during a monetary tightening \u2013 complements monetary policy by providing central banks with more policy headroom to fight inflation, while helping to reduce the likelihood of financial stress.6 Recent trends also indicate that credit and deposit growth gap, which has been a concern for some time, is narrowing. In absolute terms, the accretion to bank deposits has been higher than loan growth during the current financial year so far. 46. While being focussed on its task of containing inflation, monetary policy has also ensured that growth remains on a steady path. Both the major drivers of growth, consumption and investment, having more than 90 per cent share in GDP in Q1: 2024-25, continue to grow at a good pace. The confidence in the strength of domestic demand is led by the recovery in rural consumption emanating from buoyant agricultural activity which had been lagging during the previous two years. Festive season will provide further impetus to demand. It is also supported by the expected recovery in Government consumption (both central and state governments) as budgeted for 2024-25 \u2013 which is evidenced in the data available for Q2 so far. Government capex is rebounding after having contracted in Q1. It is expected to keep pace to match the budgeted amount. Private investment continues to gain traction, supported by rising capacity utilisation, strong corporate and bank balance sheets, and higher industrial credit. The improving outlook of capex is led by infrastructure, speciality chemical, EVs, pharma, solar PV module, automobile, steel and renewable energy. Global trade volumes remain strong which is good for our exports. Softer crude prices, if sustained, could be a tailwind for growth. 47. On the global front, it seems like we are in an interesting but challenging phase. First, uncertainties on the global front undoubtedly remain high, yet some resilience is getting built in. Notwithstanding the rise in geopolitical risks along with Chinese stimulus and its demand side impact, oil remains volatile within a range that is neither striking nor worrying like yesteryears. Second, countries seem to be determining their monetary policies based on indigenous factors, while remaining largely immune to the Fed policy pivots. Post the Fed rate cut in mid-September, the world is divided - while 10 countries have followed the Fed, another 11 countries have taken a pause, while one has hiked its policy rate. Such varying monetary policy responses reflect growing divergence in the inflation-growth dynamics across countries that coupled with continued uncertainties have prompted central banks across the globe to steer their policy path in a guarded manner managing the risk of policy errors. Third, those who have begun their policy pivot by rate cuts can be categorised into three types \u2013 those who face sharp slowdown in their economies (UK, EU, South Korea), those who had very restrictive policies (US, Canada, Norway and Iceland) and lastly, those who had started hiking very early in 2021 (like Brazil, Hungary, Columbia and Chile). Clearly, India does not fall in any of these categories. 48. To conclude, there are enough evidence to give confidence that we are on the right track. Our cautious and calibrated approach has paid off. Monetary policy is working well to contain inflation. Going ahead, there is now greater confidence on inflation aligning with the target unless disrupted significantly by weather events and worsening of geo-political risks. We also need to keep a close watch on global commodity prices, especially food and metal prices, which have shown some signs of hardening. Keeping in mind the balance in the growth-inflation outlook, the risk- reward for a change of stance to neutral is favourable now. This would allow flexibility to adapt and operate in accordance with the evolving situation. But change in stance in no way implies dropping the guard on inflation. Considering the uncertainties still prevailing on the global front, a cautious data dependent approach with regard to further course of monetary policy actions is called for. Between now and December, we will have greater clarity on some of the uncertainties \u2013 US elections, geopolitical risks and Chinese fiscal stimulus and its impact on global commodity prices. At this juncture, India\u2019s resilient growth story helps us to continue our determined focus on inflation and keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent. Hence, I vote for a status quo on rates and change of stance to neutral. 49. Since the beginning of 2022-23, monetary policy has pursued a sustained restrictive stance to achieve the goals of maintaining price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. There is now growing evidence that as the effects of some of the global shocks that drove up inflation are fading, our commitment is bringing about a better balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply domestically. Accordingly, the path of inflation is reconfiguring towards the target in the baseline forecast, by my metric of four quarters ahead inflation. This trajectory will likely encounter a hump in the near months as the projections indicate, but this is largely due to an adverse base and one-off shocks to prices of vegetables, edible oils and gram. The expectation is that effects of these shocks should dissipate by December as supply conditions improve. It is, therefore, possible for monetary policy to look through these spikes while monitoring their evolution closely until they are seen off. The overall inflation environment is improving. Households\u2019 and businesses\u2019 inflation expectations have eased and remain anchored. Consumer confidence on the price situation a year ahead is improving. Input cost pressures are expected to ease in the manufacturing sector and selling prices are expected to moderate in the services and infrastructure sectors during the third quarter of 2024-25. The decline in capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector is highly correlated with a slackening of the output gap in the sector, which should also work toward easing core price pressures. 50. Economic activity remains resilient in spite of the disinflationary monetary policy stance, supported by domestic drivers. While some high frequency indicators have slowed in the second quarter of 2024-25, this appears attributable to idiosyncratic factors like unusually heavy rainfall in the retreat of the south west monsoon and pitrupaksha. They should stabilize in the second half of the year as consumption receives a boost in the festival season, the revival of rural demand gathers further strength, and investment is buoyed by budgeted government capital expenditure gaining steam. Enterprises expect demand conditions to pick up for manufacturing companies; services and infrastructure firms indicate an optimistic outlook on demand. Overall business expectations for the last quarter of 2024-25 and the first quarter of 2025-26 are optimistic. 51. Given this outlook, it is possible to envisage that the persistence of inflationary pressures experienced so far could dissipate with a less restrictive stance of monetary policy. This assessment gains credence with the success in squeezing out inflation persistence that has been achieved. It would be apposite in this meeting to undertake an appropriate recalibration of the monetary policy stance that reflects an openness to reducing the degree of policy restraint if inflation evolves along the trajectory set out in the baseline projection. At the same time, reducing restraint too quickly may negate the progress made on disinflation. Hence, a gradual wait-and- assess approach to removing policy restraint in terms of the policy rate remains appropriate as long as inflation is not lastingly close to its target. Accordingly, I vote for maintaining status quo on the policy rate but a shift in the stance to neutral in this meeting. 52. The global economy continues to grow at a steady pace, with trade remaining resilient. Despite its uneven progress, headline inflation is softening. Divergent growth-inflation trajectories across countries have led to varying monetary policy responses from central banks. 53. In India, high frequency indicators suggest that economic activity remained steady during Q2:2024-25. Agricultural activity has significantly picked up due to a good south-west monsoon. This will contribute to both supply and demand side factors behind GDP growth. Manufacturing companies are expected to benefit from lower input costs. Services activity retains its buoyancy. 54. The Reserve Bank surveys indicate an improvement in consumer and business sentiments. Government expenditure has improved in Q2:2024-25 and this trend is likely to continue during rest of the year in line with the budget estimates. Private corporate investment is gaining steam with seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation improving in Q1:2024-25, and healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates. The two major drivers of GDP \u2013 consumption and investment \u2013 are expected to sustain their momentum observed in Q1. Consequently, the real GDP is projected to grow at 7.2 per cent in 2024-25. Further, the Reserve Bank\u2019s model based projection suggests that the economy will grow at 7.1 per cent during 2025-26. India\u2019s growth story remains intact. 55. Headline CPI inflation moderated during July-August 2024, as anticipated, benefiting primarily from a favourable base effect in July. Food prices registered a decline in July-August, but high frequency food price indicators available for September indicate an upturn in food prices. Together with a large unfavourable base effect, this would in all probability lead to a substantial jump in headline inflation in September. The momentum in food prices continues even in the first week of October which, if sustained, is likely to keep even October headline inflation high. Beyond the short-term, however, the outlook for food inflation is becoming more favourable with improvement in kharif and rabi season prospects. Core inflation, in absence of a major cost-push shock, is likely to remain contained on continuing transmission of past monetary policy actions. These considerations have resulted in inflation projection of 4.5 per cent for 2024-25. 56. Overall, the Indian economy presents a picture of stability and strength. The balance between inflation and growth is well-poised. Despite the near-term uptick in inflation, the outlook for headline inflation towards the later part of the year and early next year points to further alignment with the 4 per cent target. Thus, the conditions are appropriate for a change in monetary policy stance to neutral from withdrawal of accommodation. This would provide greater flexibility and optionality to monetary policy to act in accordance with the evolving outlook. It also provides space to watch out for the uncertainties on the horizon \u2013 ranging from heightened geo-political tensions and volatile commodity prices to risks of adverse weather in food inflation. These are significant risks and their impact cannot be underestimated. We need to remain vigilant. 57. At this stage of the economic cycle, having come so far, we cannot risk another bout of inflation. The best approach now would be to remain flexible and wait for more evidence of inflation aligning durably with the target. Monetary policy can support sustainable growth only by maintaining price stability. Taking all these factors into consideration, I vote for changing the stance from withdrawal of accommodation to \u2018neutral\u2019 while keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. ", "file10": "The fifty second meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during December 4 to 6, 2024. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Nagesh Kumar, Director and Chief Executive, Institute for Studies in Industrial Development, New Delhi; Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Economist, Mumbai; Professor Ram Singh, Director, Delhi School of Economics, Delhi; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. After assessing the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 6, 2024) decided to: Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral monetary policy stance and to remain unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. 6. The global economy remains stable with growth holding up amidst waning inflation, albeit at a slow pace. Geopolitical risks and policy uncertainty, especially with respect to trade policies, have imparted heightened volatility to global financial markets. 7. On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) registered a lower than expected growth of 5.4 per cent in Q2:2024-25 as private consumption and from a investment decelerated even while government spending recovered contraction in the previous quarter. On the supply side, the growth in gross value added (GVA) during Q2 was aided by resilient services and improving agriculture sector, but weakness in industrial activity \u2013 manufacturing, electricity and mining \u2013 tempered overall growth. Looking ahead, robust kharif foodgrain production and good rabi prospects, coupled with an expected pickup in industrial activity and sustained buoyancy in services augur well for private consumption. Investment activity is expected to pick up. Resilient world trade prospects should provide support to external demand and exports. Headwinds from geo-political uncertainties, volatility in international commodity prices, and geo-economic fragmentation continue to pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2024-25 is projected at 6.6 per cent with Q3 at 6.8 per cent; and Q4 at 7.2 per cent. Real GDP growth for Q1:2025-26 is projected at 6.9 per cent; and Q2 at 7.3 per cent (Chart 1). The risks are evenly balanced. 8. Headline CPI inflation surged above the upper tolerance level to 6.2 per cent in October from 5.5 per cent in September and sub-4.0 per cent prints in July-August, propelled by a sharp pick-up in food inflation and an uptick in core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation. Going forward, food inflation is likely to soften in Q4 with seasonal easing of vegetables prices and kharif harvest arrivals; and good soil moisture conditions along with comfortable reservoir levels auguring well for rabi production. Adverse weather events and rise in international agricultural commodity prices, however, pose upside risks to food inflation. Even though energy prices have softened in the recent past, its sustenance needs to be monitored. Businesses expect pressures from input costs to remain elevated and growth in selling prices to accelerate from Q4.1 Taking all these factors into consideration, CPI inflation for 2024-25 is projected at 4.8 per cent with Q3 at 5.7 per cent; and Q4 at 4.5 per cent. CPI inflation for Q1:2025-26 is projected at 4.6 per cent; and Q2 at 4.0 per cent (Chart 2). The risks are evenly balanced. 9. The MPC noted that the near-term inflation and growth outcomes in India have turned somewhat adverse since the October policy. Going forward, however, economic activity is set to improve along with rising business and consumer sentiments, as reflected in the Reserve Bank\u2019s surveys. The recent spike in inflation highlights the continuing risks of multiple and overlapping shocks to the inflation outlook and expectations. Heightened geo-political uncertainties and financial market volatility add further upside risks to inflation. High inflation reduces the purchasing power of both rural and urban consumers and may adversely impact private consumption. The MPC emphasises that strong foundations for high growth can be secured only with durable price stability. The MPC remains committed to restoring the balance between inflation and growth in the overall interest of the economy. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral stance of monetary policy as it provides flexibility to monitor the progress and outlook on disinflation and growth and to act appropriately. The MPC remains unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target, while supporting growth. 10. Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Professor Ram Singh voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. 11. Dr. Nagesh Kumar, Shri Saugata Bhattacharya, Professor Ram Singh, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for continuing with the neutral stance of monetary policy and to remain unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target, while supporting growth. 12. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on December 20, 2024. 13. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 5 to 7, 2025. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent 14. Since the October 2024 MPC Meeting, economic conditions have worsened dramatically on both economic growth and inflation fronts. At the last meeting, I had expressed my concerns about the growth slowdown and the need to support it through a cut in policy rates. The decline in the Q2 2024-25 growth numbers from 8.2% achieved in 2023-24 and from 6.7% on Q1 2024-25 to just 5.4% is much sharper than expected. The slowdown has led to the downgrading of the GDP growth forecasts for 2024-25 by most analysts from around 7% earlier to around 6.5% now. The RBI has downgraded it to 6.6% from 7.2% earlier. The extent of the slowdown is serious enough to warrant policy attention. 15. The slowdown largely reflects the weakness of the industrial sector. The growth rate of agriculture value added has actually improved from 2.0% in Q1 2024-25 to 3.5% in Q2. The services growth has moderated slightly from 7.7% in Q1 to 7.1% in Q2, while the growth rate of industrial value added has decelerated sharply from 7.4% in Q1 to only 2.1% in Q2. All the subsectors of the industry, namely mining, manufacturing and electricity, have decelerated. What is most worrying is the deceleration of growth of manufacturing value added from 7.0% to 2.2%. The corporate performance indicators corroborate the deceleration of manufacturing growth. The sales growth of manufacturing companies has moderated from 6.2% in Q1 to 3.3% in Q2. In particular, negative growth rates in iron & steel and cement are worrying. The listed private non-financial corporate performance results also suggest that manufacturing GVA growth decelerated from 11.7% (y-o-y) in Q1 to 5.0% in Q2. They also indicate the softening of corporate profit margins and corporate tax collections coming down for listed private manufacturing companies. The early results of Enterprise surveys suggest that seasonally adjusted capacity utilization declined from 75.8% in Q1 to 74.7% in Q2. There is also a trend towards deleveraging with the moderation of the total cost of projects sanctioned by banks and financial institutions. As a result of the slowdown of industrial activity, the employment sentiment deteriorated in Q2. 16. The factors driving growth slowdown are the slowdown of both consumption and investment. While government consumption has come out of elections-related squeeze of -0.2% in Q1 to a 4.4% growth in Q2, the growth of private consumption expenditure has moderated from 7.4% in Q1 to 6.0% in Q2. The fixed investment growth has declined from 7.5% in Q1 to 5.4% in Q2. The export demand has also declined from 8.7% in Q1 to just 2.8% in Q2. Although merchandise exports registered an impressive growth of 17.2% in October 2024, one has to see if the buoyancy sustains given the tendency of export figures to fluctuate wildly from month-to-month and were squeezing by -2.0% in July, -9.7% in August, and stayed rather flat at 0.4% in September 2024. 17. On the other hand, inflation, which was seemingly restrained in September, has hit 6.2% in October, a 14-month high. So, we find ourselves in a slow growth, high inflation scenario. However, inflation is largely on account of food prices, which have a rather high weight in the CPI. In particular, it is tomatoes, onions, and potatoes (TOP) which are largely responsible for the high inflation observed recently. As per the data from the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), price momentum for vegetables (TOP) went up from 0.7% in September 2024 to 14.0% in October but was easing to -4.4% in November 2024. DCA\u2019s edible oil prices had also shown a high price momentum of 8.6% in October 2024 from 1.8% in September but eased down to 3.7% in November. Excluding food, the CPI headline comes down to just 3.1% in October 2024. Keeping in mind the easing of vegetables and edible oil in November, food inflation should be easing further in the coming months. Core inflation persistence has declined over time, suggesting an improving anchoring of inflationary expectations. 18. The policy responses to address the challenges of high inflation and growth slowdown should look into their determinants. Monetary policy, being a demand management tool, has limitations in addressing inflation largely driven by a supply- side shock driving up vegetable prices. The high vegetable prices represent an essentially seasonal supply-demand mismatch that has started to correct itself in November 2024. 19. On the other hand, the slowdown of the manufacturing sector can be addressed by bringing down the cost of capital, which may stimulate investments as well as consumer demand. Hence, a rate cut could help, among other measures. Expanding the manufacturing sector could also help in containing inflationary pressures by enhancing the supply capacity. 20. Most of the central banks around the world, barring a few, have embarked on an easing cycle in recent months, with some, like the US Fed, adopting a rather aggressive posture towards cutting the policy rates. India risks currency appreciation if we do not follow the process of normalisation when most others have moved forward. The rupee has already been appreciating in real terms, and a further appreciation would hurt the competitiveness of Indian products. 21. Therefore, I believe that a rate cut would help in reviving economic growth without worsening the inflationary situation, which may soften with seasonal correction in prices. Hence, I will again vote for a 25-basis point cut in the repo rate while keeping a neutral stance. In addition, we should also explore the use of non-rate measures for enhancing liquidity, such as a 50-basis point cut in CRR, to help enhance liquidity. Statement by Shri Saugata Bhattacharya 22. Among the multiple economic and financial developments informing a difficult voting decision, extracting interpretable signals from the set of factors underlying the unexpectedly sharp Q2 FY25 real GDP growth slowdown was, square and centre, the primary one. Was this slowdown transitory or a harbinger of some deeper underlying trend? Leading indicators broadly suggest the former, while highlighting some specific weaknesses. RBI nowcasts show a revival in Q3 growth outlook consistent with its FY25 GDP 6.6% forecast. Both data and surveys also point to expectations of an improving growth \u2013 inflation balance in the second half of FY25. Yet, we also note that some indicators keep alive niggling doubts. 23. Second, what is the extent of the growth sacrifice induced by inflation-focused tight monetary policy conditions? This is a complex question, necessitating a decomposition of transient, idiosyncratic, cyclical, policy-related and structural components underlying this slowdown. This is further complicated by the ongoing transmission of the previous easing cycle. A study provides some quantitative insights on the transmission effects of repo rate actions.2 This study estimates that the macroeconomic impact of the cumulative 250 basis points increase in the repo rate since May 2022 was comparatively much smaller on aggregate demand while having a more significant effect on reducing headline inflation and inflation expectations. In addition, the \u201cImpulse Response Functions (250 bps Shock to Policy Rate)\u201d show that the largest adverse impacts on aggregate demand had been in FY23 and FY24, before tapering off in H1 FY25. 24. Third, among the factors widely reported to have contributed to the growth slowdown, high interest costs are increasingly hypothesised as the proximate one. This is a serious issue and deserves a more granular dissection. A priori, we would have expected that smaller companies have been more adversely affected. Based on the 2Q FY25 results of listed non-Govt non-finance (NGNF) companies3, we calculate interest costs to EBIDTA ratios for smaller (with sales of less than Rs 100 crs), mid-size (Rs 100-1,000 crs) and large (greater than Rs. 1,000 crs) companies. For smaller companies, interest costs to EBIDTA are indeed high, but have fallen from a high of 46% in Q3 FY24 to 38% in Q2 FY25. The ratio for mid-sized companies has moderated from 25% to 18% and has remained stable for large companies at 11-12%. However, the share of smaller and mid-sized companies in total interest expenses is only about 9-11%; hence, they are unlikely to have contributed significantly to the growth slowdown. In no way, however, does this detract from the need to reduce interest costs for small enterprises. 25. Fourth, in my October \u201924 statement, I had noted: \u201cRetail credit, conjectured (albeit untested) to be a driver of consumption demand, while slowing, still remains robust.\u201d Macro-prudential regulations have resulted in slowing growth in some of these segments, probably reducing the consumption stimulus. I remain unconvinced, though, given potential risks to financial stability, that lower policy rates are an antidote to this particular causal factor. Unquestionably, however, the flow of credit to micro and small enterprises needs to increase. This will require a coordinated policy response, one of which might be through augmenting system liquidity. 26. Fifth, the growth \u2013 inflation balance, from being \u201cwell-poised\u201d as noted in RBI Governor\u2019s October \u201924 statement, has, in my view, turned adverse on both growth (as elaborated above) and inflation. The October CPI inflation printed at 6.2% (above the tolerance ceiling), following a 5.5% readout for September. Although largely the result of high prices of a few vegetables, other food components are also becoming more expensive. Preliminary data suggest that food price inflation for November, while moderating, is expected to remain elevated. 27. Globally, prices of edible oils have risen sharply. The FAO Food Price Index had surged to its highest level in 18 months in October \u201924, up 5.5% yoy. This was led largely by vegetable oils, but also dairy products and sugar. High edible oils prices are also manifest in India. Prices of other agri-related inputs like non-edible oils (which are inputs into personal care products, confectionary, etc.) have also increased. These might eventually feed into consumer goods prices. IMD has 2 Patra, M. D. et al, \u201cMonetary Policy Transmission in India: The Recent Experience\u201d, RBI Monthly Bulletin, October 2024, pp. 189-201. 3 Capitaline forecast4 that \u201cduring the upcoming winter season (December 2024 to February 2025), above-normal minimum temperatures are likely over most parts of the country\u201d; this, I am told, does not augur well for rabi crop yields. Core inflation has also started to creep up. Various surveys also suggest that prices of non-farm inputs have risen and are expected to remain elevated; so are services prices. 28. Sixth, the effects of heightened uncertainty, largely emanating from global sources, on domestic macro-economic and macro-financial metrics have increased. Spillovers have already impacted domestic financial conditions, which, going forward, might affect economic activity. It is worth emphasising that financial channels influence domestic monetary policy through the well-established trilemma of open economy macroeconomics. The present neutral stance provides the flexibility to respond quickly and appropriately to evolving economic conditions. 29. The prevailing economic conditions bring to mind a phrase a former RBI Governor had invoked in a different context: \u201cFestina Lente\u201d, Latin for \u201cmake haste slowly\u201d. This is now apposite for guiding policy decisions. I had earlier noted the risk of making a \u201cpolicy error\u201d in my October \u201924 statement; if anything, this risk has now increased. 30. Accordingly, based on my assessment of the appropriate response to the increasing complexity of the economic environment, I vote to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent, while continuing with the neutral monetary policy stance. 31. In my view, the following questions warrant the attention of the MPC: Is there a strong case for a shift in the monetary policy (MP) in response to the recent developments on inflation and growth fronts, domestically and internationally? How are wages and prices likely to play out in the short term and impact inflation growth trade-offs? What is the nature of the relation between the short-term and the long- term inflation growth trade-offs for the Indian economy? What are the implications of the elevated uncertainty for the MP? 32. Though elevated, the inflation trajectory remains along the projected/expected lines. As we advance, food inflation is likely to soften in Q4:2024-25, and energy prices are also expected to be stable in the near future. Overall, CPI inflation for 2024-25, projected at 4.8 per cent, is within the tolerance band though above the 4.0 per cent target. The risks are evenly balanced. 33. Moreover, by now it is widely accepted that vegetable prices are essentially a supply-side phenomenon. Interest rates have little bearing on the volatility in fruits and vegetables prices. During the last ten years, changes in repo rates seem to have made little difference to vegetable price volatility. Specifically, the elevated interest rates during the last ten quarters had no significant effect on price volatility, especially of TOP (tomato, onion and potato) vegetables, the primary source of volatility in headline inflation. 34. Therefore, the question becomes: Does the food inflation transmit to the core inflation? 35. There is empirical evidence that the impact of food inflation on core inflation has significantly reduced in recent years suggesting that the wages and price-setting mechanisms warrant a serious reexamination. The effectiveness of the main channel of transmitting food inflation to core inflation, i.e., the food price-induced increases in wages, has reduced in recent years. The result is a duality - significant divergence between the food and core inflations. During the last nine quarters, while the food prices remained elevated, the CPI core has remained below the price inflation target of 4%. A significant part of this divergence is attributable to slacks (weak wage growth) and other frictions in the labour and food product markets. 36. Moreover, the CPI inflation figures used by the MPC are somewhat higher than what would follow if the share of food and beverages (45.86%) was in line with the total household consumption expenditure (MPCE) data. Even with current weights, core inflation is at 3.8%. From April to October 2024, the CPI excluding TOP, Gold, and Silver on an average stood at 3.80%, whereas the core inflation rate (%) excluding Gold and Silver was on an average at 2.84%. GDP Growth 37. The GDP growth rate has hit a seven-quarter low of 5.4% in Q2 amid a manufacturing slump and deceleration in private consumption and investment. The GVA, a critical indicator of economic activity, also came at 5.6 per cent in Q2. Accordingly, the RBI has lowered the GDP growth forecast to 6.6 per cent, down significantly from earlier projections of 7.2 per cent. 38. The MPC's mandate is to ensure price stability while supporting growth. The present situation of significantly slower growth without material changes in the prospects for inflation requires shifting the pivot of monetary policy to a counter- cyclical mode. 39. The empirical relation between the core inflation and GDP growth rate (actual and potential) is well established. A persistent decrease in the core inflation during the last 7-8 quarters, combined with the slowdown in growth rate, suggests that the difference between the actual and potential growth rate is increasing. These observations and the fact that the labour market is not tight mean that the economy can grow significantly faster without triggering inflation. 40. From another perspective, the difference between the core inflation (<4%) and the policy rate (at 6.5 %) has been more than 2.5% for over a year now; this makes for a restrictive monetary regime. Further, the existing policy rates are more than two percentage points higher even when compared to the estimated average CPI inflation for the next four quarters - CPI inflation for 2024-25 Q3 at 5.7 per cent and Q4 at 4.5 per cent. For 2025-26, Q1 is projected at 4.6 per cent, and Q2 at 4.0 per cent. Therefore, the forward-looking policy rate is greater than the neutral R-star. 41. When the correlation between food prices and core inflation is weak at best and the share of items contributing to inflation has come down, keeping interest rates elevated to keep overall inflation closer to the target imposes growth costs that are disproportionate to the gains on the prices front. 42. Several indicators point to a slowing economy. Nominal sales growth of listed private manufacturing companies has fallen to 3.3% in Q2: 2024-25. Operating profit margins have moderated for manufacturing and non-IT services while the staff cost has seen only a modest increase even after factoring in the additional jobs. The flow of financial resources to the commercial sector has slowed noticeably, and the total costs of bank/FIs-funded projects have come down. The leverage ratio of companies surveyed by the RBI has reduced from almost 35% in H1: 2022-23 to 29.5% in H1: 2024-25. 43. A rate cut will reduce the costs of doing business and increase the opportunity cost of holding on to cash for firms and companies. Hopefully, this will boost companies' investment plans and improve the scope of employment-linked incentive schemes helping induce a virtual cycle of wage growth and demand. By tightening the labour market, it will also improve efficacy of the MP. 44. A growth-supportive monetary policy is also consistent with the international scenario. In most of big developed markets, the central banks have already cut benchmark interest rates. China's central bank has also cut interest rates. Furthermore, the currencies of several Asian countries, including our competitors, including China, are depreciating against the USD. Expectation of low crude prices is expected to provide further elbowroom for rate cuts by the RBI. 45. While deciding on short-term inflation-growth trade-offs, MP must factor in the long-term implications of the decisions made today. How we address the short-term inflation-growth trade-offs has implications for the long-term growth path. High growth rate, by providing meaningful employment to the millions on the job, boosts demand while reducing supply-side constraints. 46. There will always be uncertainty about the path of inflation and the appropriate policy rates. Due to increases in the capital intensity of production processes due to advances in ICT and AI, the employment elasticity of output is likely to fall in the future. As such, we have a limited window of 10-15 years to capitalise on the demographic dividend. So, the imperative is high growth rate while minimising the likelihood of extreme scenarios on the inflation front. 47. In a world with heightened uncertainty, if the MP were to use insights from research in the areas of Rules-versus-Standards and Regulation under Uncertainty, it would be more plausible to aim for price stability within a range rather than aiming to bring CPI inflation to a point target of 4%. The costs of trying to shoot at the point target in every state of the uncertainty ridden future can be unjustifiably high. 48. Considering all these factors, I vote to: Reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent. Maintain the monetary policy stance to \u2018neutral\u2019. 49. In my August 2024 statement, I had stated that we could see a window opening up for monetary policy to change its course, which materialised in October 2024 as the risk-reward for a change in stance to neutral was favorable then. Subsequently, in my October 2024 statement, I had mentioned that the neutral stance would allow flexibility to adapt and operate in accordance with the evolving situation. Since then, however, incoming data seems to have disturbed the balance between inflation and growth, thereby pushing ahead the space to normalise policy rate that was opening up. Let me elaborate on this based on the global and domestic perspective. 50. Globally, the easing cycle is quite guarded notwithstanding the fact that the tightening was unprecedented in many dimensions.5 The challenges to policy makers are aggravated predominantly because of the uncertainty that is prevailing on various fronts keeping the financial markets on razor\u2019s edge. Even though many economies, who have had historical high policy rates or face severe sharp slowdown, have begun cutting policy rates, they remain cautious, maintaining a restrictive stance due to lingering uncertainty about inflation aligning sustainably with their targets. The last mile of disinflation is turning out to be trickier for many systemic and inflation targeting countries, slowing down the number and size of their rate cuts. With incoming data giving mixed signals, central banks are increasingly getting unintentionally checkmated by their own communication or rate action. Meanwhile, there are also countries like Australia, Norway and Malaysia, which had raised rates in a calibrated manner during their tightening cycle and are now holding back till their economic conditions become favorable to start the easing cycle. 51. On the domestic front, the inflation-growth balance turned adverse since the last policy in October. While inflation has surprised on the upside, growth has also surprised on the downside. As per our assessment, both are likely to reverse their course in the near future. At this juncture, confirmation of durable softening of inflation in the coming months is important. The critical factor would be the ongoing rabi season which will give us the clarity about the expected correction in food prices. Early indications point to a good start for crop sowing, adequate reservoir levels and good soil moisture conditions. We also need to be sure that the moderation in growth in Q2 was just one-off and the economy will recover on projected lines. Agriculture and government spending growth is expected to be much stronger and we expect around 7 per cent growth on average in the second half of 2024-25. 52. In this context, sequencing and timing of measures are very important for its effectiveness as witnessed during the pandemic time easing and post pandemic tightening. After the change in stance to neutral in the last meeting, addressing liquidity conditions to ensure adequate systemic liquidity seems more appropriate sequentially. Thus, a cash reserve ratio (CRR) cut of 50 bps by the Reserve Bank is appropriate at this juncture as it will provide durable liquidity to banks and keep the money market rate well aligned with the repo rate. It will also facilitate improvement in transmission, once the rate easing cycle sets in. This move is consistent with the neutral stance and will normalise the CRR to its pre-policy tightening and pre- pandemic level of 4 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). The multiplier effect of the CRR cut would have an expansionary impact on deposit and credit over an extended period. A deft mix of policy tools, if timed and sequenced well, can best address the current challenging situation. 53. To conclude, amidst difficult policy trade-offs, our cautious and calibrated approach has kept us in good stead. Related literature shows that during periods of heightened uncertainty with mixed data signals, conservatism and cautious approach can be useful.6 The need of the hour is to be watchful of the forthcoming data to ascertain the projected improvement in the balance between inflation and growth outlook. If food price pressures wane on projected lines, this would open up the policy space to normalise rates. Our neutral stance provides the flexibility to respond to the evolving situation. Accordingly, I vote for a status quo on rates and stance in this meeting. 54. The estimates of national accounts in India for the second quarter of 2024-25 reveal the corrosive power of repeated inflation shocks on economic activity. On the supply side, the drag from manufacturing performance shows the toll that persisting price pressures are taking on the urban consumer\u2019s spending capacity. In turn, this is depressing sales growth among non-financial corporations and slowing down capex plans \u2013 as evident in the deceleration in gross capital formation \u2013 since corporates\u2019 outlook for demand remains tainted by inflation. There may be wider ramifications on investment activity if slower growth in nominal GDP prompts expenditures on capital outlays to be pruned to ensure the achievement of fiscal targets. The prospects for the second half of the year are brighter than the outturn for the first half. It is now that efforts must be made to bring down inflation and revive consumption and investment spending. 55. Food price pressures are typically treated as transitory; however, if these shocks are not followed by reversals in the form of price declines, the pressures remain in the consumer price index and influence its evolution. Consequently, the readings for November and December are also expected to remain elevated, delaying the convergence of outcomes with the target. Households\u2019 inflation perceptions and a year ahead expectations have ticked up, and consumer pessimism on the inflation situation has increased. Professional forecasters have revised their inflation projections upwards and fears of complacency due to sub-target outcomes for July and August are coming to roost. What is worrying is that core inflation has edged up by 70 basis points from its July low. There are early signs of second order effects or spill overs of high primary food prices \u2013 following the surge in prices of edible oils, inflation in respect of processed food prices is starting to see an uptick. The pick-up in price rises of household services like those of domestic helps/cooks also reflects higher cost of living pressures due to elevated food prices beginning to transmit to these specific wages. In this environment, the hardening of input costs across goods and services and their flow into selling prices needs to be watched carefully. If allowed to run unchecked, it can further undermine the prospects of the real economy, especially industry and exports. the 56. It is a durable reduction in inflationary pressures that can rekindle the impulses of growth in a sustained manner. The expected winter easing of food prices may provide the turning point. With the prospects for private consumption expected to improve over the rest of the year, the key is to get investment going, since exports are hostage to a difficult external environment. Private investment will want to see a robust revival of domestic demand to draw in the slack that it is now experiencing. The monetary policy stance is open to support growth, but it must await the ebbing of inflation on a durable basis or else the uneven progress made so far in disinflation will get dissipated. Accordingly, I vote to maintain status quo on the policy rate and persevere with a neutral stance in this meeting. Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 57. The Indian economy remains resilient, notwithstanding the lower GDP data for Q2 of 2024-25. The direction of inflation is downwards, although the path is interrupted by periodic humps due to food inflation. As a result, the inflation growth balance has got somewhat unsettled now. 58. The latest high frequency indicators suggest that economic activity is recovering in Q3. Rabi sowing has exceeded previous year\u2019s level and high reservoir levels augur well for the overall rabi output. With the expected pick up in government capital expenditure and end of monsoon related disruptions, industrial activity is expected to normalise and recover from the lows of the previous quarter. Services activity remains buoyant. On the demand side, consumption and investment is expected to pick up in the second half of the financial year on the back of factors like improving agricultural outlook, higher government expenditure, steady services sector growth, etc. Improving global trade volume will provide support to external demand. Overall, the real GDP growth is projected to be higher in the second half of the year at 7.1 per cent and for full year at 6.6 per cent. 59. A sharp accentuation in food inflation pressures led to headline inflation moving above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent in October from sub-4 per cent levels in July-August. While primarily emanating from the spike in vegetable prices, the sharp pick-up in edible oil prices due to levy of import duties and continuing stickiness in cereals inflation also added to the surge in food inflation in October. Core inflation, though muted, also registered a sequential uptick during September-October 2024. Though, yet again, supply side shocks in food have interrupted the ongoing disinflation towards the target rate, moderation in food inflation can be expected in Q4:2024-25 due to correction in vegetables prices, robust kharif harvest arrivals, a likely good rabi crop and adequate cereal buffer stocks. Core inflation is likely to remain broadly contained as the disinflationary effect of past monetary policy actions continues to play out. On balance, headline inflation is expected to ease to 4.5 per cent in Q4:2023-24 and further to 4.0 per cent by Q2:2025-26. 60. In my overall assessment, the gains achieved so far in the broad direction of disinflation need to be preserved, while closely monitoring the evolving outlook of both inflation and growth. The flexibility inherent in the neutral stance of monetary policy gives us the space to monitor the incoming data and assess the outlook for confirmation of our expectations on the fronts of inflation and growth. 61. The policy priority at this critical juncture has to be on restoring the inflation- growth balance. The fundamental requirement now is to bring down inflation and align it with the target. Lower inflation will enhance disposable income with households and increase their purchasing power. Such an approach would support consumption and investment demand. Without addressing this core issue, it would not be possible to foster sustainable growth. As I have pointed out on several occasions, the biggest support for higher growth would come from price stability. Prudence and practicality demand that we now continue with the neutral stance of monetary policy and keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Accordingly, I vote for the same. Any other approach would be counterproductive and a case of inappropriate timing. (Puneet Pancholy) 61.
