{"file_1": "The thirtieth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45 Z B of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from August 4 to 6, 2021. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Senior 2. Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Professor, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma joined the meeting through video conference. According to Section 45 Z L of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the 3. Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45 Z I on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (August 6, 2021) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting during June 2-4, 2021 the pace of global recovery 6. appears to be moderating with the resurgence of infections in several parts of the world, especially from the delta variant of the virus. In June and July, global purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) slipped from the highs scaled in May. The growing consensus is that the recovery is occurring on a diverging two-track mode. Countries that are ahead in vaccination and have been able to provide or maintain policy stimulus are rebounding strongly. Growth in other economies remains subdued and vulnerable to new waves of infections. There has been a slowing of momentum in global trade volumes in Q2:2021, with elevated shipping charges and logistics costs posing headwinds. There has been a considerable hardening of commodity prices, particularly of 7. crude oil. The latest agreement within the Organisation of Petroleum Countries (OPEC) plus to raise oil production for a likely restoration of output to the pre- pandemic levels by September 2022 imparted transient softening to spot and future crude prices from the recent peak in early July. Headline inflation has ratcheted up in several advanced economies (AEs) as well as most emerging market economies (EMEs), prompting a few central banks in EMEs to tighten monetary policy. In contrast, sovereign bond yields have softened across AEs as markets seem to have acquiesced to the views of central banks that inflation is largely transitory. In EMEs, bond yields remain relatively high on inflation concerns and country-specific factors. In the foreign exchange market, EME currencies have depreciated in the wake of portfolio outflows since mid-June as risk appetite ebbed, while the US dollar has strengthened. 8. On the domestic front, economic activity picked up pace in June-July as some states eased pandemic containment measures. As regards agriculture, the south- west monsoon regained intensity in mid-July after a lull; the cumulative rainfall up to August 1, 2021 was one per cent below the long-period average. The pace of sowing of kharif crops picked up in July along with some high frequency indicators of rural demand, notably tractor and fertiliser sales. 9. Reflecting large base effects, industrial production expanded in double digits year-on-year (y-o-y) in May 2021 on top of the massive jump in April, but it was still 13.9 per cent below its May 2019 level. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) that had dropped into contraction to 48.1 in June for the first time in 11 months, rebounded well into expansion zone with a reading of 55.3 in July. High- frequency indicators \u2013 e-way bills; toll collections; electricity generation; air traffic; railway freight traffic; port cargo; steel consumption, cement production; import of capital goods; passenger vehicle sales; two wheeler sales \u2013posted strong growth in to COVID related protocols and easing of June/July, reflecting adaptations containment. Services PMI remained in contractionary zone due to COVID-19 related restrictions, though the pace eased to 45.4 in July from 41.2 in June 2021. Initial quarterly results of non-financial corporates for Q1:2021-22 show healthy growth in sales, wage growth and profitability led by information technology firms. 10. Headline CPI inflation plateaued at 6.3 per cent in June after having risen by 207 basis points in May 2021. Food inflation increased in June primarily due to an uptick in inflation in edible oils, pulses, eggs, milk and prepared meals and a pick-up in vegetable prices. Fuel inflation moved into double digits during May-June 2021 as inflation in LPG, kerosene, and firewood and chips surged. After rising sharply to 6.6 per cent in May, core inflation moderated to 6.1 per cent in June, driven by softening of inflation in housing, health, transport and communication, recreation and amusement, footwear, pan, tobacco and other intoxicants (as the effects of the one- off post-lockdown taxes imposed a year ago waned), and personal care and effects (due to sharp reduction in inflation in gold). 11. System liquidity remained ample, with average daily absorption under the LAF increasing from \u20b95.7 lakh crore in June to \u20b96.8 lakh crore in July and further to \u20b98.5 lakh crore in August so far (up to August 4, 2021). Auctions for a cumulative amount of \u20b940,000 crore in Q2:2021-22 so far under the secondary market government securities acquisition programme (G-SAP) evened liquidity across illiquid segments of the yield curve. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the changes in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 11.0 per cent y-o-y on July 30, 2021 driven by currency demand. As on July 16, 2021, money supply (M3) and bank credit by commercial banks grew by 10.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 43.1 billion in 2021-22 (up to end-July) to US$ 620.1 billion. Outlook 12. Going forward, the revival of south-west monsoon and the pick-up in kharif sowing, buffered by adequate food stocks should help to control cereal price pressures. High frequency indicators suggest some softening of price pressures in edible oils and pulses in July in response to supply side interventions by the Government. Input prices are rising across manufacturing and services sectors, but weak demand and efforts towards cost cutting are tempering the pass-through to output prices. With crude oil prices at elevated levels, a calibrated reduction of the indirect tax component of pump prices by the Centre and states can help to substantially lessen cost pressures. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is now projected at 5.7 per cent during 2021-22: 5.9 per cent in Q2; 5.3 per cent in Q3; and 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 5.1 per cent (Chart 1). 13. Domestic economic activity is starting to recover with the ebbing of the second wave. Looking ahead, agricultural production and rural demand are expected to remain resilient. Urban demand is likely to mend with a lag as manufacturing and non-contact intensive services resume on a stronger pace, and the release of pent- up demand acquires a durable character with an accelerated pace of vaccination. Buoyant exports, the expected pick-up in government expenditure, including capital expenditure, and the recent economic package announced by the Government will provide further impetus to aggregate demand. Although investment demand is still anaemic, improving capacity utilisation and congenial monetary and financial conditions are preparing the ground for a long-awaited revival. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank surveys expect expansion in production volumes and new orders in Q2:2021-22, which is likely to sustain through Q4. Elevated levels of global commodity prices and financial market volatility are, however, the main downside risks. Taking all these factors into consideration, projection for real GDP growth is retained at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 consisting of 21.4 per cent in Q1; 7.3 per cent in Q2; 6.3 per cent in Q3; and 6.1 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22. Real GDP growth for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 17.2 per cent (Chart 2). 14. Inflationary pressures are being closely and continuously monitored. The MPC is conscious of its objective of anchoring inflation expectations. The outlook for aggregate demand is improving, but still weak and overcast by the pandemic. There is a large amount of slack in the economy, with output below its pre-pandemic level. The current assessment is that the inflationary pressures during Q1:2021-22 are largely driven by adverse supply shocks which are expected to be transitory. While the Government has taken certain steps to ease supply constraints, concerted efforts in this direction are necessary to restore supply-demand balance. The nascent and hesitant recovery needs to be nurtured through fiscal, monetary and sectoral policy levers. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID- 19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 15. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. 16. All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das, except Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on August 20, 2021. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during October 6 to 8, 2021. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent 19. The revival of economic activity seen in Q4: FY2020-21 was disrupted in the first two months of Q1: FY2021-22 by the surge of second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sharp rise in infections and fatalities due to the pandemic during April-May 2021 compared to the same period in the previous year also led to imposition of restrictions on economic activities across states. As the second wave began to subside, some of the high frequency indicators of the economic activity have also shown revival in June and July 2021. 20. While pick-up in the pace of vaccinations against the disease enables return to more stable working conditions, uncertainties are highlighted by the continued potential for the emergence of new infections as the economic activity picks up unless the people\u2019s Covid appropriate behaviour becomes a norm. Likelihood of emergence of new variants of the virus and its impact is also posing a challenge to achieve sustained recovery of the economy. The global experience so far has highlighted the need for faster vaccination 21. coverage and adoption of preventive measures by the population to achieve greater control over the spread of the disease. In the economies of the US and UK where the activity bounced back in 2021, sustaining the pace of this recovery has come under pressure with the rise in the Covid infections. 22. Impact of the pandemic on the nature and extent of economic recovery has been illustrated by the experience of the past two waves. The resilience of formal sector on the supply side and higher income segment on the demand side appear to be greater than the informal or lower income segment. Recovery of the contact intensive sectors of the economy \u2013 such as travel by public transport, hospitality and tourism - is slow and weak. Both \u2013 staying afloat and recovery \u2013 have required accommodative monetary, financial sector policy support. These fiscal and interventions are critical in restoring business and consumer confidence. The negative impact of the pandemic in Q1: FY 2021-22 has been significant. 23. The outlook surveys by the RBI covering manufacturing, services and infrastructure enterprises conducted during April-June 2021 find the perceptions of overall business conditions to be unfavourable in all three sectors. The survey of industry finds that a larger proportion of manufacturing enterprises experienced decline in capacity utilisation in Q1: FY 2021-22 than those who experienced rise in capacity utilisation. However, the survey finds that enterprises expect the situation to improve in Q2: 2021-22 with respect to capacity utilisation. The production levels, employment and financing conditions are also expected to improve in Q2: FY 2021-22 compared to the assessment for Q1, consistent with the expectation of improvement in capacity utilisation in Q2: FY 2021-22. Expectation of improvement in profit margins is more widely shared among the respondents in Q2: FY 2021-22 in all the sectors compared to the assessment for Q1. Overall, firms in the manufacturing, services and infrastructure sectors expect improvement in demand conditions in Q2: FY2021-22. Moreover, the investment intentions remain muted for the current financial year with fewer firms planning fresh investments as compared to the previous year. 24. The consumer confidence survey by RBI polled during June 28-July 9 in the major urban centres of the country shows lesser pessimism in the perception of general economic conditions compared to the findings of the survey of May. On the other hand, the expectations for one-year ahead are also characterised by larger proportion of the respondents who do not expect the general conditions to improve compared to those who expect otherwise. Household income situation is seen to have deteriorated in July compared to the assessment in May 2021. However, one- year-ahead income situation is expected to improve but the optimism is yet to reach the level seen in January 2021. Expectations on overall spending recover slightly, with improvement in spending on \u2018essential items\u2019. Improvement in household income following the recovery of employment conditions is necessary to spur consumer sentiments. 25. In the case of industry, based on IIP data, while manufacturing output has shown high growth year-on-year basis in April-May 2021, on a low base in which the national level movement restrictions were effected, on month over month basis, there was a decline in growth rate. In the case of mining and electricity pattern is the same. 26. The high frequency indicators such as domestic air passenger traffic, passenger vehicle sales, motor cycle sales, tractor sales and consumption of finished steel and production of cement point to improvement in economic activity in June over the levels in May. In the case of GST collections and e-way bills, the year-on- year growth rate during May-June 2021 remains strong but over a weak base. The unemployment rate and labour participation rate, broader indicators of the economic activity tracked in the CMIE\u2019s household surveys, show improvement in the level of economic activity in June and July, with data available up to the week of 21 July 2021. Merchandise exports show sequential growth during the period April-June 2021. However, the year-on-year growth of non-food credit, another indicator of the economic activity at a broader level, was 6.2 per cent in early July not significantly higher than the growth seen a year ago. 27. The South-West monsoon, a key determinant of the performance of agriculture, has not been close to the long-period average in the current year up to July across all the different regions. The area sown in the Kharif season up to July 30th was 4.7 per cent lower than in the previous year, with cotton, oilseeds and coarse cereals areas declining at a higher rate than the overall crop area. The reservoir levels are, however, reported to be higher than in the previous year, leaving potentially improved availability of water for irrigation that supports improved crop yields. The overall picture that emerges points to signs of nascent stage of recovery 28. from the initial shock of the second wave of the pandemic during April-May 2021. Recent assessment of the year-on-year growth of GDP at constant prices in 29. FY2021-22 by a number of professional forecasting organisations, which were made in the month of July, has ranged from 8.8 to 10 per cent. Further, the median real GDP growth forecast of Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) conducted by RBI in July 2021 is 9.2 per cent. The SPF assessment of GDP growth is a downward revision from 9.8 per cent obtained by the survey carried out in May 2021, which itself was a downward revision from 11.0 per cent from the earlier round of March 2021. The successive reductions in the recent two rounds reflect the impact of the second wave of Covid-19. An important upward revision in the July 2021 SPF is in the external sector: merchandise exports and merchandise imports are projected to increase at a higher rate than in the May 2021 round of the survey. 30. Taking into the various factors, the projected GDP year-on-year growth rate of 9.5 per cent for FY 2021-22 is within the range of forecasts available in July including the SPF July 2021. The present projections are unchanged from the overall GDP growth projection in the June meeting of MPC, although quarterly projections of 21.4% (Q1), 7.3% (Q2), 6.3% (Q3) and 6.1% (Q4) reflect an upward revision in Q1 and downward revisions in the remaining three quarters. 31. Even as there are signs of economic recovery from the disruption to the growth momentum achieved in Q4: FY2020-21, the conditions impacting inflation are a concern. The global commodity prices impact the overall domestic price situation. One of the key drivers of present inflation is the fuel prices. The year-on-year inflation in CPI for fuel is up from 4.4 per cent in March 2021 to 12.7 per cent in June 2021. The sharp rise in the prices of fuels used for transportation, feed into the core inflation through transportation services prices. Similar is the impact of other prices affected by international commodity price rise such as the metals. While these may be one-time effects, prices would remain elevated unless the external shock is reversed. Although the sequential month-on-month momentum has moderated in June in the case of food and fuel and declined in the core components, the inflation rate remains elevated. In the case of CPI food, the year-on-year rate has remained above 5 per cent in May and June. Vegetables and edible oils are contributing to the sequential momentum and going forward, prospects of Kharif output would affect the price pattern. Finally, price adjustments to account for pandemic induced altered supply-side conditions may also emerge as the demand conditions improve. These may be one-time effects on prices. The households\u2019 expectations captured in the RBI\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of urban households conducted during June 28- July 9, 2021 reflect an increase of 0.5 percentage points in inflation expectations 3- months ahead. The pace of increase is lower than that observed in the previous survey of May 2021. 32. The projected year-on-year CPI inflation rate for the Q2-Q4 quarters of FY 2021-22 at 5.9, 5.3 and 5.1 per cent is higher than the projections in June, mainly on account of the higher fuel and items other than food and fuel. The FY 2021-22 CPI inflation is projected at 5.7 per cent. With faster expansion of vaccination program, better health care infrastructure 33. and measures by the public to prevent the spread of Covid infections, the rise in consumer sentiments can be expected to be sustained and supportive of the expansion of supplies. All policy measures are needed to achieve normalisation of economic activities and moderation of inflationary pressures. 34. I vote in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. I also vote in favour of continuing with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 35. A global conviction seems to have firmed up that the inflation spike is due to Covid-19 related supply bottlenecks and therefore is temporary. US ten year G-secs rates have softened. Research finds inflation to be more in Covid-19 affected products. 36. Oil, global commodity and semi-conductor prices are actually showing signs of reversal. Domestic inflation has also marginally fallen in June compared to May, and its momentum softened considerably, as second wave lockdowns were eased. There may be more reversals in future. Signs of second-round inflation pass through are still limited. The August RBI inflation forecasts may be an overestimate. 37. The MPC has a difficult job as it battles both the slowdown and the inflation Covid-19 has triggered. Even so, marginal moderation in inflation has twice this year provided just in time relief\u2014pointing again towards supply-side causation and volatility. 38. Advanced economy central banks emphasize the dangers of premature tightening: ECB plans to maintain its stimulus in the form of ultra-low interest rates until inflation durably reaches its 2% target. The US fed is targeting average inflation and wants it to rise above target to compensate for being below for long; in India the aim should be to provide support until the investment cycle starts durably. As long as inflation is in the tolerance band, it can gradually be brought down to target. 39. According to Taylor rules estimated for India a persistent rise in expected inflation above the tolerance band or rise after closing of output gap, require policy rates to rise. But optimal policy can differ. No mechanical formula is adequate, especially in these unusual times. Output gap is especially difficult to measure under the Covid-19 shock\u2014there is a requirement to recreate jobs, alleviate sectoral distress as well as pull out of a decade long investment slowdown. There is uncertainty regarding a possible third wave and global slowdown as delta and other variants spread, or of the reverse\u2014an aggressive revenge spending and export boom. 40. Moreover, currently we have a fiscal contraction, contrary to most countries. But here monetary policy is not at the zero bound and has space to keep real interest rates low. The equilibrium real rate does become negative under temporary output shocks. But real rates should not fall below the equilibrium rate. Wholesale price inflation is higher than consumer inflation giving lower real rates to firms, but it helps them less if the inflation is due to cost shocks. 41. If, however, indirect taxes impart persistence to inflation, this could de-anchor inflation expectations and pose challenges for monetary policy. Research shows that while temporary commodity spikes are looked through, a persistent rise tends to affect inflation expectations. The volatility of Indian fuel prices is much lower than international and average rise is more, since taxes are not decreased as much when international oil prices rise, as they are increased when oil prices fall. A persistent rise in Indian fuel prices is at odds with inflation targeting. 42. Although household inflation expectations are naive and much in excess of realized inflation, the direction of change is instructive. While household 3-month and 1-year inflation expectations continue to increase, current perceptions are stabilizing. The latter fell in September 2020 as the first wave clearly moderated. Expectations also fell later in November. This cycle may repeat, since the uncertainty associated with expectations rose sharply in May 2020 with the onset of Covid-19 and has remained high since. These aspects and the June softening in inflation momentum indicate it is 43. better to wait and watch inflation, inflation expectations and growth outcomes. Inflation has been above target for many months but the rise is due to multiple supply shocks associated with the prolongation of Covid-19. Sustained rise above the tolerance band has not yet exceeded the three quarters time given to the MPC. The reputation and responsiveness of an inflation targeting regime, as well as supply-side support from the government, may be adequate to prevent de-anchoring of inflation expectations despite these multiple shocks. Therefore, I vote for status quo on the repo rate and policy stance. 45. Whenever normalization starts, it should be very gradual and aligned to growth recovery and inflation paths. Since stance affects only repo rate actions, other normalization can start even in an accommodative stance. This is only my view\u2014the MPC does not vote on liquidity actions. In 2009 it was decided to first reduce excess liquidity and this is what markets expect. But in its normalization, the US Fed stopped balance sheet expansion, announced on October 29, 2014, but did not reverse its size\u2014this worked well in keeping markets calm after the taper-on shock and in helping recovery. Since excess liquidity is absorbed at the reverse repo, M3 growth cannot be excessive unless demand revives. A rise in the price of money can restrain its growth. The definition of the stance is consistent with some durable liquidity surplus continuing in a tight/neutral stance. 46. India had excessively tight financial conditions in much of the past decade. Some slack is required to lubricate the economy so payments percolate to low income segments. Banks are now unable to adequately supply the needs of an increasingly diverse financial sector, so schemes targeting liquidity to different sectors need to continue. Moreover, India is subject to large negative liquidity shocks from rise in currency holding, government cash balances and foreign capital outflows1. Surplus durable liquidity can help to absorb and counter these, especially as the US Fed exits accommodation. 47. Some G-SAP support may also have to continue until fiscal consolidation is adequate. But this consolidation is happening faster than expected as tax revenues are buoyant. Despite a rise in short-rates, long-term spreads may still fall with less than anticipated government borrowing and as there is more conviction on the inflation target. Government cash balances are already large. If, however, expected inflation raises G-secs rates by 1%, and the public debt GDP ratio is about 100%, government interest payments will rise by 1% of GDP. Compared to that, a cut in fuel taxes would sacrifice about 0.5% of GDP in revenues and have many other benefits such as anchoring inflation expectations, reviving demand as well as enabling a fair sharing of the burden of oil price shocks. Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma 48. In the last several meetings, my statements have expressed the belief that the balance of risk and reward is in favour of monetary accommodation. As the pandemic continues to mutate, it appears to me that the balance of risk and reward is gradually shifting, and this merits a hard look at the accommodative stance. 49. First, Covid-19 is beginning to look more and more like tuberculosis which kills a very large number of people every year without inflicting major damage to the economy; in other words, it is beginning to resemble a neutron bomb. The ability of monetary policy to mitigate a human tragedy of this nature is very limited as compared to its ability to contain an economic crisis. Related to this is the lengthening of the time horizon of the pandemic. Global experience (particularly countries like Israel which are witnessing rising case counts despite very high levels of vaccination) suggests that vaccination is insufficient to stamp out the pandemic though it might reduce its severity. The possibility that Covid-19 will haunt us (though with lower mortality) for the next 3-5 years can no longer be ruled out. Keeping monetary policy highly accommodative for such a long horizon is very different from doing so for what was earlier expected to be a relatively short crisis. 50. Second, monetary policy has very broad effects on the entire economy, and this was appropriate in the early phase of the pandemic which caused generalized economic distress. More recently, however, the ill effects of the pandemic have been concentrated in narrow pockets of the economy. At the industry level, contact intensive services have suffered heavily, while many other industries are now operating above pre-Covid levels. At the firm level, MSMEs have suffered severely, while large businesses have prospered. At the household level, the pandemic has been devastating for weaker sections of the society, while the affluent have weathered it reasonably well. Geographically also, the pandemic has done its worst damage in around 100-200 districts spread across a relatively small number of states. Monetary policy is much less effective than fiscal policy for providing targeted relief Indeed, monetary accommodation appears to be stimulating asset price inflation to a greater extent than it is mitigating the distress in the economy. to to show signs of greater 51. Third, inflationary that indications persistence expectations may be becoming more widely entrenched. Most worrying of all, there is now a reduced degree of confidence that demand side inflationary pressures would remain quiescent. After averaging above 6% in 2020-21, inflation is forecast to be well above 5% in 2021-22, and is not expected to drop below 5% even in the first quarter of 2022-23 according to RBI projections. While there is some comfort that inflation is forecast to be below the upper end of the tolerance band, it is important to emphasize that the inflation target for the MPC is 4% and not 6% or even 5%. The tolerance band is designed to allow for forecast errors, implementation shortfalls and measurement issues. Treating 5% as the target would significantly increase the risk of inflation targeting failures. (While I have seen some commentary suggesting that there may be a case for raising the inflation target during the pandemic, that decision clearly lies with the government and not with the MPC.) inflationary pressures are beginning than anticipated earlier. There are In this context, I believe that the current level of the reverse repo rate is no 52. longer appropriate. I am conscious of the fact that the MPC\u2019s mandate is supposed to be restricted to the policy rate or the repo rate. Unfortunately, the monetary policy statement of this meeting (as in the past several meetings) contains the line: \u201cConsequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent\u201d. I have for some time now being arguing that if the reverse repo rate does not fall within the remit of the MPC, then the announcement of this rate should be in the Governor\u2019s statement and not in the MPC\u2019s statement, but this view has not found favour with the rest of the MPC. Hence, I have no choice but to express my disagreement with the level of the reverse repo rate. A gradual normalization of the width of the corridor is warranted. In my view, a phased normalization of the corridor would increase the ability of the MPC to keep the repo rate at 4% for a longer period, and this should in my view be a greater priority for the MPC than maintaining an ultra- low reverse repo rate for some more time. 53. At a time when the economic recovery is still nascent, it is extremely important that monetary policy serves as an anchor of macroeconomic stability. That would reduce the inflation risk premium as well as the term premium and help stabilize long term interest rates. As I have argued in my past statements, a low long term interest rate is more important for inducing an investment led growth than a low short term rate. In this light, I fear that the forward guidance and monetary stance are becoming counter productive. By creating the erroneous perception that the MPC is no longer concerned about inflation and is focused exclusively on growth, the MPC may be inadvertently aggravating the risk that inflationary expectations will be disanchored. In that scenario, rising risk premia could cause long term rates to rise. Easy money today could lead to high interest rates tomorrow. On the other hand, by demonstrating its commitment to the inflation target with tangible action, the MPC will be able to anchor expectations, reduce risk premia, and sustain lower long term interest rates for longer thereby aiding the economic recovery. For these reasons, I am not in favour of the decision to keep the reverse repo rate at 3.35%, and vote against the accommodative stance. 54. On the other hand, I vote for maintaining the repo rate at 4% for the following reasons. Economic growth was unsatisfactory long before the pandemic, and even if the economic ill effects of the pandemic abate to some extent, substantial monetary accommodation is warranted. Persistent high inflation means that the monetary accommodation has to be somewhat restrained, and, therefore, I argued above for raising money market rates towards the repo rate of 4% from the current ultra-low level of 3.35%. The repo rate of 4% corresponds to a negative real rate in the range of 1-1.5% based on forward looking inflation forecasts. In my view, this level of rates is currently appropriate for reviving economic growth without excessive risk of an inflationary spiral. Needless to say, the MPC needs to remain data driven so that it can respond rapidly and adequately to any unforeseen shocks that may arise in future. The policy trade-offs that I highlighted at the June MPC meetings are no less 55. relevant today. However, the policy balance needs to be reviewed after appraising the recent information on inflation and growth. 56. The trepidation reflected in my June MPC statement, when I stated that the risks of breaching the upper tolerance level are not insignificant, materialised in its dreaded form when May inflation data was released in June. There were three important facets of that data. First, the headline inflation crossed the upper tolerance level, raising the prospects that inflation could stay above the tolerance band for most part of the year. Second, the momentum in May was high with 1.65 per cent month- over-month (m-o-m) increase being about 2\u00bd times of what can be considered normal for the month. Third, price increases were generalised across commodities that month. Of the 299 commodities for which item-level price data is made available by NSO on a monthly basis, as many as 240 commodities witnessed price increase during the month, which was the highest ever for the flexible inflation targeting period. 57. The latest available CPI numbers for June released in July, however, turned out to be antithetical, telling a very different story. First, the headline inflation surprised on the downside and stayed at 6.3 per cent with price levels dropping for several groups. It showed that May price spike may have been caused by fresh supply-side disruptions in the second wave and the month\u2019s inflation number may have been biased upwards contaminated by data collection difficulties. Second, the momentum in June with a m-o-m increase of just 0.56 per cent was distinctly below the average momentum seen for the month. Third, the general increase in prices seen in May did not sustain in June and fewer items witnessed price increases during the month than is witnessed on an average. Moreover, the momentum in WPI that was exceptionally high during February-April 2021 has also receded during May-June 2021 reducing the risks of high passthrough ahead by producers to consumers at a retail level. 58. Interpreting inflation trends have turned difficult with these mixed trends and some fuzziness in data. However, going forward, three considerations are important. First, in terms of baseline forecast, post the correction in price levels witnessed in June, inflation is projected to stay above the target, but within the tolerance bands. Second, with inflation averaging 6.23 per cent since December 2019 and breaching the upper tolerance level in 13 of those 19 months, inflation persistence remains a concern even though the supply-side shock in May could have large transitory component. Even though the nature of inflation is cost-push, persistence of inflation is worrisome, especially as inflation expectations are getting impacted partly by the adaptive expectations but also in part due to inertial element in this inflation that needs to be closely watched. The third aspect, that can have an overriding consideration in policy decision at hand, is that this inflation is not from the demand side. Aggregate demand remains sub-normal and fragile. The extended price pressures are emanating from second round effects of a very large cost-push shock which to a sizable part has been passthrough from global commodity prices across energy, metal and mineral space, though mineral prices have seen a sharp correction over last two weeks. The effects have been magnified as on May 6, 2020, excise duty on petrol and diesel was hiked by 44 per cent and 69 per cent, respectively and has not been reversed in face of fiscal constraints. Model based estimates suggest the excise duty hike itself may have pushed headline inflation higher by 60-80 bps, adding to cost push inflation. 59. Growth recovery remains fragile accentuated by the dent caused by the second wave and continued uncertainties about pandemic driven by distance to herd immunity and virus mutations. Risks that recovery can falter ahead remain on number of counts. First, at the start of our meetings, cumulative rainfall deficiency in monsoon, has been just 1 per cent. However, the spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon this season has been sub-par. While sowing deficiency that was large in early July has been largely bridged, some adverse impact on yields and outturn can emerge. These risks can magnify if climate changes cause a repeat of weather disruptions as has often happened of late with unseasonal rains affecting some horticulture crops. Second, the IIP in Q1 of 2021-22 is likely to remain below the pre- pandemic average for fiscal year 2019-20 as is already known to be the case for the output level of eight core industries with its June levels still 3.8 per cent below the pre-pandemic fiscal year average for 2019-20. Third, the high frequency indictors also have similar story. Over two-thirds of high frequency indicators remain below pre-pandemic levels. Fourth, services sector is particularly vulnerable. Services PMI at 45.4 in July remains in contraction zone implying two months after the second wave, services activity is still perceived to be falling m-o-m. Fifth, informal sector particularly requires policy support, with emerging evidence of added scaring from the second wave. Sixth, capacity utilization rates are still abysmally low with OBICUS seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation rate of 67.6 per cent in Q4 not only being markedly lower than the long-term average (from start of the survey in Q1:2008-09 till the pre-pandemic period ending Q4:2019-20) of 74.6 but is also below the all-time pre-pandemic low. In Q1:2021-22, the second wave of Covid-19 infections would have again brought the capacity utilisation rates further down from this low as is also the indication from the Industrial Outlook Survey. the bottom of 60. It is not unusual for central banks to set policies based more on current conditions than forecasts in times of crisis or extreme uncertainties. Currently, risk of policy errors on either side remains given the large uncertainty on growth and inflation as well as policy trade-offs attached to it. Relying exclusively on forward- looking policies increases these risks, especially with extant wide probability distribution attached to inflation forecasts and lack of good information on distributional aspects of growth the pyramid disproportionately, the importance of which I explained in my last MPC statement. Inflation is currently elevated above target and as a baseline is expected to recede. However, the probability distribution of the projections over a one-year horizon, as provided in the resolution fan charts, even at 50 per cent confidence level leaves the possibility of inflation breaching the upper tolerance level or falling below the lower tolerance level. In these circumstances, policy can respond with agility should need arise. If newer supply-side disturbances or elongation of imported commodity price inflation occurs it can impel a reassessment. However, currently these risks seem to have diminished, though not waned, with Kharif sowing deficiency getting bridged and global commodity price cycle showing signs of thawing on back of anticipated cyclical slowdown of the Chinese economy and possibility that the US economy, dented by the third wave, may not overheat. On the other side, the possibility of prolonged disinflationary impulse on back of sustained demand weakness cannot be ruled out altogether. 61. The MPC\u2019s current mandate is to set the policy repo rate and the stance of the monetary policy. Getting the timing and sequence of policy change wrong and inviting policy reversals later can result in costly increase in output and inflation volatility. Therefore, at this stage status quo would be better option awaiting further clarity from near-term incoming data. Changing repo rate at this stage will not be effective and apt from sequencing viewpoint. So, I vote for keeping repo rate unchanged and continuing the accommodative stance. 62. Policy focus to revive growth on a durable basis needs to continue and should entail consideration to avoid inflation risks that may emanate when credit demand improves, likely ahead of output gap closing. This arduous task needs to be carried without endangering sustainable recovery in growth. Narrative economics plays an important role in difficult times as even animal spirits are characterised by fat tails and can produce endogenous business cycle movements. However, averting markets becoming opiated to slush liquidity designed as temporary crisis measure is critical to facilitate unwinding when the time comes. Gradual adjustments that are non-disruptive are possible within the accommodative stance. Therefore, I vote with the resolution. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 63. With infections plateauing and vaccination underway on a national scale, people are stepping out of isolation and workplaces are filling up. Power consumption is recovering, freight traffic has shown pandemic-proofing, air travel is rebounding, and all payment modes have registered an uptick in volumes. In my opinion, these indicators are foretelling a revival of business and consumer confidence. This window must be utilised to reinvigorate the interrupted recovery even while preparing for a possible third wave. Absorptive capacity of the economy is rising again, and this is reflected in higher imports and utilisation of capital flows from abroad to supplement domestic saving and push up the investment rate - gross capital formation has risen to 31.3 per cent in January-March 2021, with two-thirds of net foreign capital inflows received by India during that quarter being absorbed domestically. Yet, even as near- term prospects have brightened, aggregate demand conditions are taking more time to heal. 64. Amidst the extreme uncertainty encircling the path of the pandemic, monetary policy authorities have sought to impart some certainty by a commitment to a stance of accommodation extending into the future. With the upsurge of inflation worldwide, this effort to anchor expectations is under scrutiny. In some countries, markets have acquiesced with the authorities\u2019 view that inflation pressures are transitory and do not warrant a change in the policy stance. In others, central banks have pre-emptively tightened the policy stance despite assessing inflation as transitory. This is a razor\u2019s edge dilemma and responding to it, in my view, involves a judgment call that puts both foresightedness and inflation fighting credibility on the line. 65. My vote in this meeting is to maintain the policy rate at 4 per cent and continue with the accommodative stance as adopted so far. In my view, monetary policy has an inherently domestic orientation and the stance of policy is predominantly shaped by country-specific exigencies. In India, my assessment is that headline inflation may persist at current elevated levels at least through the second quarter of 2021-22 before easing in the third quarter when the kharif harvest arrives in markets. There are demand-supply mismatches as in the case of protein-rich food items, edible oils and pulses, which are being addressed by specific supply measures, and there are indications that these price pressures are softening. On the other hand, underlying or core inflation may remain stubborn for longer due to disruptions caused by the pandemic, overlaid with increases in margins and taxes. The high flux in elevated international crude prices remains a risk to inflation and to the terms of trade. It is important to cushion the economy from this volatility through policy interventions. The economy is struggling to regain the momentum that had gathered in the 66. second half of 2020-21. As mentioned earlier, a solidly entrenched increase in aggregate demand is yet to take shape. Although it seems meaningful to compare progress with a pre-pandemic year, it needs to be noted that in 2019-20, a cyclical downturn had matured over 2 and a half years, taking down real GDP growth to its lowest in the 2011-12 based series of national accounts. Thus, there is substantial slack in resource utilisation in the economy which needs to be drawn in to get economic activity back to normalcy. The highest priority now is to revive growth along a sustainable trajectory that becomes compatible with the inflation target as the pandemic recedes. The price that has to be paid for this policy choice is inflation in the upper reaches of but within the tolerance band in this exceptional, pandemic ravaged year of 2021-22, as against the overshoot above the upper tolerance band in 2020-21. So far, inflation outcomes are tracking this projected path. 67. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, all the meetings of the MPC have been held under challenging circumstances. This one was no less, given the nuancing required at this critical juncture \u2013 to continue to foster growth which is nascent even as there is a sharp spike in inflation almost across the globe. The MPC has prioritised revival of growth and mitigation of the impact of the 68. pandemic while ensuring that inflation expectations remain anchored, as its guiding principle. Last year, when inflation rose sharply to 7.3 per cent in September and further to 7.6 per cent in October 2020, our assessment pointed to exogenous and largely temporary supply shocks driving the inflation process. Under these conditions, the MPC decided to moderate irrational expectations building up at that time of a possible reversal of the monetary policy stance through time-specific guidance. The MPC took a call to look through the supply shocks driven inflation and sought a convergence of expectations all around that monetary policy would continue to remain accommodative in support of growth and not respond to the supply side pressures on inflation. In hindsight, our prognosis turned out to be correct as inflation ebbed to around 4.1 per cent by January 2021 and was at an average of 4.9 per cent in Q4:2020-21. The forward guidance given during October-February 2020-21 was helpful in anchoring market expectations; navigating the recovery from the crisis; and strengthening the pace of monetary policy transmission. 69. The resurgence in inflation in May and June above the upper threshold has reignited the debate on the appropriate monetary policy response. The gains in monetary policy credibility since the adoption of inflation targeting have helped the MPC to respond effectively to growth-inflation trade-offs posed by an exceptional shock like the COVID-19 pandemic. The flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework allows adequate flexibility to the MPC to deal with unanticipated shocks to the economy in the conduct of its monetary policy. The Reserve Bank\u2019s whatever it takes approach, bolstered by careful guidance on all aspects in the conduct of monetary policy, has been an important facilitator for the cusp of recovery that we are witnessing at the present juncture. 70. Our own assessment of the resurgence in inflation in India since the June 2021 policy is that it is driven largely by adverse supply-side drivers impinging on food, fuel and core groups due to multifarious disruptions caused by the pandemic. Many of current price shocks are likely to be one-off or transitory. Weak demand conditions and low pricing power are limiting the extent of their pass-through to output prices. 71. The inflation forecast given by the MPC shows that headline inflation will remain within the tolerance band \u2013 albeit closer to the upper tolerance level. The economy is slowly returning back to normalcy from the biggest shock in 100 years. The MPC\u2019s projection of 9.5 per cent GDP growth for the current year would mean that the size of the economy in 2021-22 will be moderately higher than 2019-20. There is still considerable slack in the economy. Domestic demand is picking up, but at a slow pace. Several supply side measures have been taken by the Government to deal with the inflationary pressures; however, more needs to be done. The daily new COVID-19 infections are sticky at around 40,000 cases per day. Possibility of a third wave looms somewhere in the horizon. On the whole, the economy still requires support in terms of maintaining congenial financial conditions and fiscal boosters. At such a critical juncture, can we really pull the rug and the let the economy tumble? The need of the hour is twofold: first, continue the monetary policy support to the economy; and second, remain watchful of any durable inflationary pressures and sustained price momentum in key components so as to bring back the CPI inflation to 4 per cent over a period of time in a non-disruptive manner. 72. Managing the economy and the financial markets since the beginning of the pandemic has thrown up several challenges with crosscurrents and conflicting objectives. Under such circumstances, macroeconomic policies have to be carefully nuanced by making judicious policy choices. Continued policy support with a focus on revival and sustenance of growth is indeed the most desirable and judicious policy option at this moment. I, therefore, vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as spelt out by the MPC in its June 2021 meeting. In parallel, close monitoring of the inflation dynamics will have to continue so as to anchor the inflation expectations. ", "file_2": "The thirty first meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from October 6 to 8, 2021. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. This was the first face to face meeting of the MPC after February 2020. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (October 8, 2021) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. The reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting during August 4-6, 2021, the momentum of the global recovery has ebbed across geographies with the rapid spread of the delta variant of COVID-19, including in some countries with relatively high vaccination rates. After sliding to a seven-month low in August, the global purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose marginally in September. World merchandise trade volumes remained resilient in Q2:2021, but more recently there has been a loss of momentum with the persistence of supply and logistics bottlenecks. 7. Commodity prices remain elevated, and consequently, inflationary pressures have accentuated in most advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs), prompting monetary tightening by a few central banks in the former group and several in the latter. Change in monetary policy stances, in conjunction with a likely tapering of bond purchases in major advanced economies later this year, is beginning to strain the international financial markets with a sharp rise in bond yields in major AEs and EMEs after remaining range-bound in August. The US dollar has strengthened sharply, while the EME currencies have weakened since early-September with capital outflows in recent weeks. Domestic Economy 8. On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 20.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) during Q1:2021-22 on a large favourable base; however, its momentum was dragged down by the second wave of the pandemic. The level of real GDP in Q1:2021-22 was 9.2 per cent below its pre-pandemic level two years ago. On the demand side, almost all the constituents of GDP posted robust y-o-y growth. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) increased by 18.8 per cent y-o-y during Q1:2021-22. 9. The rebound in economic activity gained traction in August-September, facilitated by the ebbing of infections, easing of restrictions and a sharp pick-up in the pace of vaccination. The south-west monsoon, after a lull in August, picked up in September, narrowing the deficit in the cumulative seasonal rainfall to 0.7 per cent below the long period average and kharif sowing exceeded the previous year\u2019s level. Record kharif foodgrains production of 150.5 million tonnes as per the first advance estimates augurs well for the overall agricultural sector. By end-September, reservoir levels at 80 per cent of the full reservoir level were above the decadal average, which is expected to boost rabi production prospects. 10. After a prolonged slowdown, industrial production posted a high y-o-y growth for the fifth consecutive month in July. The manufacturing PMI at 53.7 in September remained in positive territory. Services activity gained ground with support from the pent-up demand for contact-intensive activities. The services PMI continued in expansion zone in September at 55.2, although some sub-components moderated. High-frequency indicators for August-September \u2013 railway freight traffic; cement production; electricity demand; port cargo; e-way bills; GST and toll collections \u2013 suggest progress in the normalisation of economic activity relative to pre-pandemic levels; however, indicators such as domestic air traffic, two-wheeler sales and steel consumption continue to lag. Non-oil export growth remained strong on buoyant external demand. 11. Headline CPI inflation at 5.3 per cent in August softened for the second consecutive month, declining by one percentage point from the recent peak in May- June 2021. This was primarily driven by an easing in food inflation. Fuel inflation edged up to a new high in August. Core inflation, i.e. inflation excluding food and fuel, remained elevated and sticky at 5.8 per cent in July-August 2021. 12. System liquidity remained in large surplus in August-September, with daily absorptions rising from an average of \u20b97.7 lakh crore in July-August to \u20b99.0 lakh crore during September and \u20b99.5 lakh crore during October (up to October 6) through the fixed rate reverse repo, the 14-day variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) and fine- tuning operations under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF). Auctions of \u20b91.2 lakh crore under the secondary market government securities acquisition programme (G- SAP 2.0) during Q2:2021-22 provided liquidity across the term structure. As on October 1, 2021, reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 8.3 per cent (y-o-y); money supply (M3) and bank credit grew by 9.3 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively, as on September 24, 2021. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 60.5 billion in 2021-22 (up to October 1) to US$ 637.5 billion, partly reflecting the allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs), and were close to 14 months of projected imports for 2021-22. Outlook 13. Going forward, the inflation trajectory is set to edge down during Q3:2021-22, drawing comfort from the recent catch-up in kharif sowing and likely record production. Along with adequate buffer stock of foodgrains, these factors should help to keep cereal prices range bound. Vegetable prices, a major source of inflation volatility, have remained contained in the year so far and are likely to remain soft, assuming no disruption due to unseasonal rains. Supply side interventions by the Government in the case of pulses and edible oils are helping to bridge the demand supply gap; the situation is expected to improve with kharif harvest arrivals. The resurgence of edible oils prices in the recent period, however, is a cause of concern. On the other hand, pressures persist from crude oil prices which remain volatile over uncertainties on the global supply and demand conditions. Domestic pump prices remain at very high levels. Rising metals and energy prices, acute shortage of key industrial components and high logistics costs are adding to input cost pressures. Weak demand conditions, however, are tempering the pass-through to output prices. The CPI headline momentum is moderating with the easing of food prices which, combined with favourable base effects, could bring about a substantial softening in inflation in the near-term. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 5.3 per cent for 2021-22; 5.1 per cent in Q2, 4.5 per cent in Q3; 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 5.2 per cent (Chart 1). 14. Domestic economic activity is gaining traction with the ebbing of the second wave. Going forward, rural demand is likely to maintain its buoyancy, given the above normal kharif sowing while rabi prospects are bright. The substantial acceleration in the pace of vaccination, the sustained lowering of new infections and the coming festival season should support a rebound in the pent-up demand for contact intensive services, strengthen the demand for non-contact intensive services, and bolster urban demand. Monetary and financial conditions remain easy and supportive of growth. Capacity utilisation is improving, while the business outlook and consumer confidence are reviving. The broad-based reforms by the government focusing on infrastructure development, asset monetisation, taxation, telecom sector and banking sector should boost investor confidence, enhance capacity expansion and facilitate crowding in of private investment. The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for domestic manufacturing and exports. Global semiconductor augurs well shortages, elevated commodity prices and input costs, and potential global financial market volatility are key downside risks to domestic growth prospects, along with uncertainty around the future COVID-19 trajectory. Taking all these factors into consideration, projection for real GDP growth is retained at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 consisting of 7.9 per cent in Q2; 6.8 per cent in Q3; and 6.1 per cent in Q4 of 2021- 22. Real GDP growth for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 17.2 per cent (Chart 2). Inflation prints in July-August were lower than anticipated. With core inflation 15. persisting at an elevated level, measures to further ameliorate supply side and cost pressures, including through calibrated cuts in indirect taxes on petrol and diesel by both Centre and States, would contribute to a more durable reduction in inflation and anchoring of is progressively improving but the slack is large: output is still below pre-COVID level and the recovery is uneven and critically dependent upon policy support. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, contact intensive services, which contribute around two-fifth of economic activity in India, still lag considerably. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector is below its pre-pandemic levels and an early recovery to its long-run average is critical for a sustained rebound in investment demand. Even as the domestic economy is showing signs of mending, the external environment is turning more uncertain and challenging, with headwinds from slowing growth in some major Asian and advanced economies, steep jump in natural gas prices in the recent weeks and concerns emanating from normalisation of monetary policy in some major advanced economies. Against this backdrop, the ongoing domestic recovery needs to be nurtured assiduously through all policy channels. The MPC will remain watchful given the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for growth and inflation. Accordingly, keeping in mind the evolving situation, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 16. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. 17. All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das, except Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during December 6 to 8, 2021. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent 20. A number of indicators now point to recovery of economic activity from the severest shock of the second wave of the Covid 19 pandemic the country suffered in the first two months of the present financial year. The estimates of GDP for Q1: 2021- 22 by the National Statistical Office (NSO) point to year-on-year (yoy) increase of 20.1 per cent in this period of the second wave. This sharp rise in GDP reflects a substantially smaller economic impact of the second wave than in the first wave as relative to Q1: 2019-20, GDP in the first quarter of the current financial year is lower by 9.2 per cent compared to the decline of 24.4 per cent in Q1: 2020-21 during the first wave. These patterns highlight the extent of the negative impact of the pandemic and the challenge of rebuilding the economy considering the fact that some sectors have suffered far more than others. 21. At a disaggregate level, all major components of GDP, the private final consumption expenditure (PFCE), gross fixed investment (GFCF) and exports have increased sharply by 19.3 per cent, 55.3 per cent and 39.1 per cent, respectively, in Q1: FY 2022, year on year basis. As in the case of aggregate GDP, PFCE and GFCF are below their pre-pandemic levels in Q1: 2019-20. The Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) declined in Q1: 2021-22 over the same period in 2020-21, as it had increased substantially in the latter period. Exports are now above the pre-pandemic level seen in Q1: 2019-20. Imports rose sharply in Q1: 2021-22 but remained below the level seen in Q1: 2019-20. 22. The supply side disruptions during the second wave of the pandemic were slightly less stringent from the first wave as these disruptions were not at the national level but state level or even more localised. This helped reduce the constraints on the supply side but the demand side weakness remained slower to overcome due to the significant income and employment losses. Some of these differences in the nature of economic recovery are reflected in the present uneven pattern of growth. 23. While return to the pre-pandemic level of economic activity is to be expected when the restrictions on the supply side are liberalised, pace of this return to normalcy would depend on the factors affecting supply as well as demand. On the supply side, in the presence of adequate demand, expansion may be constrained by the supply of inputs, rise in the prices of inputs besides the need for new investments to do business in the new environment. If the pace of this recovery is slower on the supply side, prices would rise if demand grows more quickly. If the supply rises more quickly, price rise may be muted, although in both the cases, the exogenous price shocks from the external sector including crude oil and commodity markets impart upside risks to the outlook. 24. Excluding the data for April 2021, for which the yoy growth rates were exceptionally high, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP-General), while registering double digit growth rates in May and June of 2021, was still below the level of 2019 for the same two months. However, in July 2021, the IIP was above the level two years back in the case of mining and electricity and the IIP-General was only 0.3 per cent below the level in July 2019. The trend is clearly one of catching up with the pre- pandemic levels of industrial activity. There are patterns that also suggest weaker output growth in certain sectors. In July 2021, IIP for Consumer goods was lower than in July 2019, particularly for Consumer durables; it was marginally higher than the pre-pandemic levels of July 2019 for primary and capital goods; between 2 and 2.5 per cent in the case of intermediate goods and infrastructure/ construction sectors. 25. It is also important to recognise sectors in the non-IT services that are in the early stages of recovery. The MSME and informal sector enterprises face greater challenges in operating in conditions in which input price pressures are significant and consumer demand is still recovering. 26. While rural demand is expected to be buoyant in the light of higher Kharif crop output projected in the First Advance Estimates for 2021, the sales of tractors and motor cycles \u2013 proxies for rural demand conditions - show divergent pattern for April- August 2021 over the levels seen in 2019 for the same period. Tractor sales have increased sharply and motor cycle sales show a negative growth. In the case of urban demand, domestic air passenger traffic, passenger vehicles sales and consumer durables sales show divergent trends. While some of this pattern is related to supply side restrictions (air traffic) or supply chain disruptions (automobile sector), the recovery of overall consumption demand to the pre-pandemic levels is uneven. 27. RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey for September 2021 shows that a larger proportion of the respondents reported improvement in the general economic situation compared to the July 2021 survey. But a large majority of the respondents - more than 72 per cent - perceive the overall situation to have worsened compared to a year back. A larger proportion of the respondents expect improvement in the overall economic situation a year ahead, as compared to the results of the July 2021 survey. But this proportion is lower than the survey results a year back. The concerns exhibited in the consumer sentiments appear to mirror the assessment of employment and income conditions. A larger proportion of respondents are now spending more now than a year back, but the improvement is in spending on \u2018essentials\u2019 as compared to \u2018discretionary spending\u2019. A positive pattern is the decline in unemployment rates and increase in the labour force participation rates in the rural and urban areas from the peak levels seen in May 2021, as brought out by the surveys of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). 28. Investment activity has picked up over the levels seen 2020-21 but yet to reach the 2019-20 levels. Accelerated progress in vaccinations and a number of economic policy initiatives to open up opportunities for investment are among the factors constituting positive stimulus to fresh investments. Some of the positive investment sentiments are reflected in the strong FDI inflows and successful IPOs in the current financial year. The survey of enterprises conducted by the RBI mainly in August-September 2021 shows sharp improvement in demand conditions compared to the decline in the previous quarter, especially in the manufacturing sector. The demand conditions are expected to improve steadily in the next two quarters of the current financial year. Input cost pressures remain the main concern for the enterprises, leading to higher selling prices to achieve profitability. Overall business situation is expected to improve in Q3: 2021-22 and remain robust in Q4 and Q1: 2022-23, particularly for manufacturing and services. The indicators such as the PMI were in expansionary zone in July-September 29. 2021 in the case of manufacturing and August-September 2021 for services. A number of high frequency indicators point to recovery in economic activities, from the trough seen during July-August 2020. Air passenger traffic and consumption of transportation fuels show significant growth in July-August 2021, year on year basis. Broader recovery in economic activity is reflected in the steady rise in railway freight traffic, pickup in port traffic, air cargo, e-way bills and GST collections. Non-food credit has continued modest expansion although below the rate of expansion in bank deposits. The overall trends point to emerging growth momentum, some of it from the relaxation of administrative restrictions imposed in the face of the pandemic as vaccination drive is gaining acceleration across the country and reduction in the number of active cases of infection. 30. One of the key drivers of the aggregate demand in 2021-22 so far has been the exports, both merchandise and services. Imports have also increased reflecting pick-up in domestic demand. Revival of external demand on the back of pick-up of economic growth in the advanced economies has been an important factor supporting export performance. The supply chain constraints and persistence of pandemic conditions globally, particularly in some of the advanced economies are a concern. 31. With the present growth momentum, GDP in 2021-22 is expected to exceed the level achieved in 2019-20. The uneven pace of ongoing recovery across sectors highlights that the protection against the Covid infections through vaccination, practice of Covid appropriate behaviour and availability of health services to mitigate any fresh wave of the infections would be essential to achieve a broad based sustained growth. 32. Revival of economic growth has also been accompanied by inflationary pressures. Sources of inflation include price pressures from international markets and also domestic markets. Restricted supply conditions have added to the price pressures in the domestic markets. Sharp price increases in a few critical items of production and consumption also have cascading effects. The present outlook for CPI inflation has been driven by the rise in petroleum fuel prices, and international commodity prices leading to increase in raw material costs, transportation costs and energy costs, even when the recovery in demand conditions has been modest. The fiscal and administrative measures to ease infrastructure constraints by the government have helped in reducing the potential impact of price impulses from external markets. But fuller capacity utilisation, new investments to improve productivity are needed to meet the rising aggregate demand without further price pressures. Monetary and fiscal measures to support supply response to the rising demand would be needed at this crucial juncture. 33. The headline CPI inflation (yoy) during June-August 2021 averaged 5.7 per cent, well below 6.5 per cent seen during June-August 2020. Drivers of inflation were indeed different between the two years. In June-August 2020, it was food inflation and in the same period in 2021, it has been fuel inflation. The CPI for fuel rose by 12.6 per cent during June-August 2021 compared to 2.1 per cent in June-August 2020; CPI for food rose by 4.6 per cent in June-August 2021 and in the same period of 2020, the increase was 8.2 per cent. Core CPI inflation in June-August 2021 was 5.9 per cent and 5.5 per cent in the same period in 2020. Besides the spill over effects from food and fuels, core inflation is affected by the prices of transport fuels and transport services that are directly affected by the crude oil price shocks. Improving efficiency of logistics services and reduction in indirect taxes would play an important role in easing such exogenous shocks on the cost of transport services and overall inflation. Going forward, external factors such as international commodity prices 34. including petroleum crude would play an important role in the evolution of CPI. Improved demand conditions would also mean upward pressure on the price front unless supply expands with improved productivity. The projected CPI inflation rate for Q2, Q3 and Q4 in FY 2021-22 are 5.1, 4.5 and 5.8 per cent, respectively, with an average of 5.3 per cent for FY 2021-22 considering the actual rate of 5.6 per cent for Q1. This projected inflation rate for 2021-22 is lower by 40 basis points compared to the projected 5.7 per cent in August, still above the target but within the tolerance band of the inflation target. RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for September 2021 provides a median forecast of 5.3 per cent for FY 2021-22, taking actual rate of 5.6 per cent for Q1. A clear driver of this decline in projections is the food inflation. Reduction in the core CPI inflation rate from the present level will require, inter alia, reduction in petroleum fuel prices. 35. Taking into account the recent trends in output the GDP growth for FY 2021- 22 has been retained at 9.5 per cent. The projections of yoy GDP growth for Q2 have been revised upward from 7.3 per cent in the MPC meeting of August to 7.9 per cent, Q3 from 6.3 to 6.8 per cent, with the Q4 growth remaining unchanged at 6.1 per cent. The SPF for September 2021 provides a median forecast for FY 2021-22 of 9.4 per cent, revised upward from its July survey. 36. The projected moderation in the headline inflation rate and unchanged GDP growth rate for FY 2021-22 reflect improving underlying macroeconomic conditions. However, in the context of the uncertainties in the external demand and price conditions and an uneven sectoral growth pattern an accommodative monetary policy stance and broader policy support are necessary at this juncture for strengthening the growth momentum and reducing inflation pressures. 37. Accordingly, I vote in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. I also vote in favour of continuing with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 38. We have navigated a difficult year well so far with strong recoveries. Headline inflation is also softening towards the target. 39. The theory that temporary Covid-19 related supply shocks are largely responsible for inflation seems to have held out well, although repeated commodity price shocks are an issue. There is some pass through to other items but it is not generalized as yet. In addition to oil prices, inflation is higher for electronic goods and consumer durables affected by Covid-19 global shortages and supply chain issues; retail perishables supply chains were able to resolve faster. Inflation, as well as household and business inflation expectations rose during peak waves and fell thereafter. Global price shocks have turned out to be more persistent, contributing to sticky core inflation. Tax cuts on petroleum products are essential to break the upward movement that could impart persistence to domestic inflation. Government initiatives have contributed to the fall in food inflation. This, and relative fiscal conservatism, enables monetary policy to remain accommodative, keeping the real interest rate well below the growth rate, stimulating the recovery and reducing public debt ratios. The transmission to output growth from low real rates combined with surplus liquidity is well established. 40. Causality is normally from core inflation to headline but this need not be so if rise in core inflation is due to reversible supply shocks. There is large uncertainty built into current prices because of the speculative element that seeks to profit from aggravated shortages. Large sudden falls are therefore possible. Oil prices have shown high volatility. The climate change activism that is partly responsible for current spikes will also reduce oil demand in the future. There are signs of container prices softening as exports from China reduce. Policy has to be data based, since inflation may fall faster than guidance, or supply-side issues may cause new spikes. 41. Demand is also uncertain beyond pent up demand and the festival season. Some slowdown in global growth and more surprises from Covid-19 are possible, although vaccination is progressing well. Data lags mean we do not as yet know the extent of scarring in small and medium enterprises (SMEs), contact intensive services and in employment. The current situation warrants that monetary-financial conditions remain 42. accommodative. In times of great uncertainty it is important that policy remains steady and supportive. Therefore, a pause in the repo rate and an accommodative stance is required and I vote for these. Even so, policy has to continuously adapt in line with changing circumstances. Over-stimulus as after the global financial crisis, with delay resulting in sharp adjustment, has to be avoided. 43. What is the quantity of excess liquidity required? Large inflows have led to a rise in liquidity over the past two months. In advanced countries exit normally starts by stopping fresh injections of liquidity although existing levels are only allowed to reduce slowly and naturally as securities mature. The experience is markets react well to transparent changes in policy rates that follow the data. For example, if rates rise as growth is well-established, stock markets continue to do well. 44. India, however, has an informal sector as well as a modern sector that are differently served by existing arrangements for short term liquidity. Only banks have access to repo and reverse repo windows. There are also large shocks from foreign flows, government cash balances and currency leakages. Therefore, liquidity needs to be kept in sufficient surplus to absorb these shocks even as the excess is reduced allowing the reverse repo to rise gradually and arrangements for non-banks remain in place. A higher fixed reverse repo rate for banks could be linked to raising their interest rates on deposit accounts. The ECB has done this. 45. With some growth recovery, but more to go, and one year ahead inflation expected at about 5%, a real policy rate of about -1% is appropriate. 46. As the LAF band was widened last year short rates fell much more than long rates. Spreads widened for 10-year G-secs, although rates fell to their lowest in many years. Market expectations in current forward rates see short rates rising over the next year with little change in 10-year G-secs rates. As uncertainty reduces, the inflation target is well internalized, and government borrowing requirements reduce, spreads should fall further. Long rates are important for investment and as benchmarks for private borrowing. The yield curve is likely to flatten, although oil price uncertainty is a risk. 47. Given India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves and strong external fundamentals, India is well placed to absorb any volatility as advanced economy central banks begin their exit or if financial shocks spread from China. It is important that policy remains aligned to the domestic cycle and any external shocks are smoothed. 48. Several of the arguments that I made in my August statement continue to be valid, and I will summarize them quickly without repeating the detailed analysis underpinning them. First, the Covid-19 pandemic has mutated into a human tragedy rather than an economic crisis, and monetary policy is not the right instrument to deal with this. Second, the ill effects of the pandemic are now concentrated in narrow pockets of the economy, and monetary policy is much less effective than fiscal policy for providing targeted relief to the worst affected segments of the economy. Third, inflationary pressures are beginning to show signs of greater persistence than anticipated earlier. 49. Since August, I have become increasingly concerned about two other risks that have become salient globally in recent weeks. The first is that the ongoing transition to green energy worldwide poses a significant risk of creating a series of energy price shocks similar to that in the 1970s. This means that the upside risks to long term inflation and to inflation expectations are now more aggravated. My second recent concern is about the tail risk to global growth posed by emerging financial sector fragility in China reminiscent of Japan of the late 1980s. Both of these risks - one to inflation and the other to growth - are well beyond the control of the MPC, but they warrant a heightened degree of flexibility and agility. A pattern of policy making in slow motion that is guided by an excessive desire to avoid surprises is no longer appropriate. 50. For these reasons, I am not in favour of the decision to keep the reverse repo rate at 3.35%, and vote against the accommodative stance. Raising effective money market rates quickly towards 4% would demonstrate the MPC\u2019s commitment to the inflation risk premia, enhance macroeconomic stability, and allow lower long-term interest rates to be sustained for longer thereby aiding the economic recovery. reduce 51. On the other hand, I vote for maintaining the repo rate at 4% for the following reasons. Economic growth was unsatisfactory long before the pandemic, and even if the economic ill effects of the pandemic abate to some extent, substantial monetary accommodation is warranted. The repo rate of 4% corresponds to a negative real rate in the range of 1-1.5% based on forward looking inflation forecasts. In my view, this level of rates is currently appropriate for reviving economic growth without excessive risk of an inflationary spiral. Needless to say, the MPC needs to remain data driven so that it can respond rapidly and adequately to any unforeseen shocks that may arise in future. 52. Since we last met, real economic activity is on track to gradual normalisation, inflation spike has turned out to be transitory, fiscal position appears to be back on In short, budgetary macroeconomic conditions have improved and the economy looks stable. However, this should not lull us into assuming a goldilocks scenario. Significant headwinds have started blowing from the shifting global macro-economic conditions. Rising geopolitical risks complicate the scenario further. The expectations of a red piping-hot recovery have been belied. Global growth expectations are getting scaled down on account of likely taper, China slowdown, scaling back of US fiscal stimulus on back of uncertainties surrounding infrastructure bill and debt ceiling and adverse impact on activity of gas and energy shortages in Europe and elsewhere. These can have significant spillovers and spillbacks running through trade, financial and market expectations channels. They can alter the domestic macroeconomic balances and cause spells of volatility clustering over a year or more, even though the buffers so assiduously built in the recent past are likely to see the economy through without any growth collapse. 53. How do we frame monetary policy in the backdrop of the emerging new challenges? First and foremost, we need to remain data dependent. Financial markets are characterised by multiple equilibria. Capital flows can turn volatile in either direction if taper paths come with surprises. Within the flexible inflation targeting framework, we need to be conscious about exchange rate dynamics originating from exogenous shocks and incorporate those in risks though not in baseline. Amid these uncertainties, policies will need to respond with alacrity and should be untangled from any pre-commitments. If at all some guidance is needed at this stage, it has to be a soft one; with the Reserve Bank preparing markets that while policy stance is likely to remain accommodative till growth is revived on a durable basis, liquidity levels will be adjusted dynamically to appropriate lower levels that are still consistent with accommodative stance. Second, we need to reinforce our commitment to the assigned inflation target guided by data inflows on growth, inflation and other parameters. The central bank needs to remain committed to goal dependence and instrument independence as it has a statutory foundation and is also consistent with general worldwide practice amongst inflation targeting central banks. Third, we need now to focus more on risks to both inflation and growth and calibrate policies as the situation evolves. Considerable uncertainty about output gap in pandemic times remains, with filtering techniques guiding much faster closure than structural models that capture scarring better. However, in my judgement, if no new disruptions to growth emerge, output gap will close sometime in 2022-23 and monetary policy should start to gradually reposition to lowering underlying inflation and inflation expectations next year, especially if inflation edges up from the energy and services side amid sticky goods core inflation. Fourth, an Arjuna\u2019s eye needs to be kept on commodity prices and we need to consider different scenarios according to which we can calibrate our policies. I will explain this point in some details later. 54. Let me now revisit growth and inflation landscape for the next 12-months. Growth recovery after the second wave remains nebulous and there is anecdotal evidence that the wave deepened scarring on small businesses. Of the industries at NIC 5-digit level, 55 per cent of the 404 industries for which data is available, are operating at below 2019-20 levels and 63.4 per cent are operating at below 2018-19 levels, indicating need for not only to support demand revival and ameliorate pandemic supply disruptions but also address the structural malaise that appears to be causing an industrial stagnation. After an encouraging sequential improvement in high frequency indicators in July, there was a loss of momentum in August, when only about three-fifths of the indicators registered improvement over the preceding month. As of now, only about half the indicators have normalised to pre-pandemic levels and only a fifth of indicators to levels achieved in March 2021 before the second wave derailed the normalisation process. However, the activity levels can normalise faster in H2:2021-22 and reach pre-pandemic levels before fiscal year-end on back of vaccinations ramp-up and considerable re-opening of the economy with removal of most Covid-related movement restrictions. 55. Investment intentions, as revealed by the phasing details of projects financially assisted by the financial intermediaries or funded through oversees borrowings or equity raising, show investment retrenchment in 2020-21 and a rather weak pipeline for 2021-22 with a 47.5 per cent year-on-year drop. Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation rate that was at 66.6 per cent in Q4:2020-21 had dipped to 61.7 per cent in Q1:2021-22 marred by the second wave, but the dip was much lower than in the first wave when the rate had dropped to 48.9 per cent. Investment demand is lagging consumption demand but has started to look up. Net responses of Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) shows that capacity utilisation rebounded in Q2:2021-22 and further improvement is expected. While in recent years capex has been essentially led by power and roads, there are signs that true investment may be getting somewhat understated given the recent spurt in intangible investments that are not getting fully reflected in national accounts. There are also signs that on the back of PLI scheme investment will get more broad-based in near-term. Monetary policy has already lowered the hurdle rates since 2019-20. Fiscal policy has cut the effective corporate tax rates by nearly 39 per cent in September the same year. This means that the user cost of capital has dropped markedly. However, investment has not responded much till now because of huge pandemic related uncertainty that has affected consumer and business confidence, depressed aggregate demand and posed execution and cash flow difficulties. Corporates chose to deleverage, and their investment intentions have fallen. Consumer confidence improved sequentially in Q2:2021-22 but remains gap down compared to normal levels pre-pandemic. Debt/Equity ratio of corporates has already declined from above 60 per cent in 2015- 16 to around 35 per cent in 2020-21. Once structural policies work and animal spirits revive on back of reduced uncertainties, investment will turnaround. In the interim, the current accommodative policy is helping in shoring up consumption demand. With rising global uncertainties, at this juncture, it important that we preserve macro- financial stability, so as to be able to nurture growth rebound. 56. Coming to inflation, while one expects further disinflation in near months, the baseline reverses thereafter despite base effects being moderately on the favourable side. The momentum is expected to pick up in H2:2021-22 and there are upside risks and stickiness of core that warrant attention. In my assessment, the probability that oil prices may touch or cross US$85/barrel before the year ends and could average US$80/barrel or more in H2 are not insignificant. It can have significant impacts that are hard to precisely quantify due to non-linearities and uncertainties but, on a ballpark from the baseline, can be expected to raise inflation by 15-20 bps, lower growth by 13-15 bps, have negligible effects on fiscal subsidies and widen CAD by about 0.25% of GDP. Unless cooperative solutions are found, the underlying gas shortages in Europe are going to get worse in the winters and as they might enervate climate change commitments. The increased dependence on fossil fuels can structurally lift energy inflation and its passthrough to general price level. High imported coal prices are already affecting power generation in some coastal plants in India. Chips delivery time has gone up to 21 weeks from 12 weeks in the pre- pandemic period. Automakers are compelled to cut down production. Container freight rates are still on the rise having risen 2-8 times on various global routes. In general, supply constraints persist and if demand revives fast, it can add to inflation. So, managing supply side will be critical. While there are some signs that price rise broadened during August CPI, the spread is moderate at best and not reflective of generalisation of price rise. Inflation expectations remain high but are not unanchored yet and have dampened by 50-60 bps in the latest round. While this does afford solace, further dampening of inflation expectations will be needed as output levels gets normalised. Interestingly, some recent research from an influential central bank has casted scepticism over long-run inflation expectations being an important factor driving inflation dynamics. To my view, introducing such new paradigms in monetary policy is playing with fire and carry dangers that central banks will lose control over inflation as the economies recover. 57. In sum, we have broadly been right in averting premature tightening and allowing economy to recover. With complementary actions in calibrating liquidity, negative real rates to savers can now be corrected in period ahead. Considering the above, I vote for keeping the stance unchanged and for keeping policy rate unchanged in line with the resolution. 58. The assessment made in August 2021 that inflation would ease in the third quarter of 2021-22 has been happily overtaken by actual outcomes in the form of a decline in food inflation. Looking ahead, specific supply measures are working to address demand-supply mismatches in this category. With agricultural production prospects looking bright, further easing of food inflation may take down the headline in the third quarter more than initially expected. On the other hand, the formation of inflation is being buffeted by repeated shocks that have taken fuel inflation to an all- time high and turned core inflation persistent, with risks to the upside. Accordingly, it is important to remain on guard about second order effects from these transitory perturbations that gives these components of inflation a resistant character by their recurring incidence. At this time, however, pressures from wages and rentals remain muted. Staff costs in the organised sector are rising again as hiring and normal work processes resume. There is also some evidence forming that cost pressures may not be able to be absorbed any longer and selling prices may turn up. Thus, while the trajectory of inflation may undershoot the projections made in August, it is likely to be uneven, sluggish and prone to interruptions. 59. Beginning in August, various indicators are suggesting that the economy is negotiating a potential gravitational swing-by from the retarding forces unleashed by COVID-19. Pre-pandemic levels of output are being sighted. Agriculture and allied activities look set to achieve and even exceed last year\u2019s record production; manufacturing \u2013 the laggard among the components of industry \u2013 is just short of 2019-20 levels; and contact-based services are healing fast. Exports can become a force multiplier that accelerates the pace of growth. They provide the avenue for the economy to break out of the limits imposed by the size of the domestic market which is still struggling with pent-up demand becoming more durable. By the end of September, the half-way mark of an ambitious export target for the year is about to be crossed. 60. Even as domestic macroeconomic configurations are improving, the risks from global developments are rising and warrant a close watch as they could stifle the recovery that is underway in India. Exports are directly at risk from logistics bottlenecks, shortages of containers and personnel in international shipping, and elevated freight rates. Policy interventions, including coordinated multilateral efforts, are needed urgently to prevent global trade from choking. More broadly, global growth is losing steam, circumscribing the strength of the recovery with shortages of key intermediates such as chips and semi-conductors. And inflation is now everywhere and raging, with implications for the revival of consumption demand. This is precipitating diverse monetary policy actions which are accentuating the fissures in the global economy. Recent financial developments amidst a sea of froth highlight the excesses of indebtedness and the potential contagion for the real economy, especially if financial conditions tighten. In my view, the biggest risks to India\u2019s macroeconomic prospects are global and they could materialise suddenly. 61. In this milieu, I vote to maintain the policy rate and the accommodative stance of policy unchanged, awaiting stronger evidence on demand-led inflationary pressures. Until then, congenial financial conditions need to be in place. 62. The COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented crisis, that led to record output and employment losses combined with bouts of financial market volatility and supply disruptions, has rendered the job of central bankers across the globe even more challenging. In India also, we had to deal with sharp meltdown in growth, rise in inflation and threat to financial stability, all at once. Given the complexity of the challenges, the policy responses had to be geared not just towards short-term stabilisation, but also to potential long-term implications. During the last eighteen months, therefore, our priority has been to revive growth and preserve financial stability, even as we remain steadfastly committed to keep inflation closer to the target. The global economy now is on a more difficult tangent of slowing growth 63. momentum with entrenching inflationary tendencies. As the classical trade-off that central banks face between slowing growth and higher inflation is getting edgier, their actions have been in response to their domestic macroeconomic circumstances. India\u2019s policy has also been driven by domestic factors. 64. As per our assessment, while the recovery is gaining traction and aggregate demand is rebounding, the economy still operates below the pre-pandemic level. Despite the projected 9.5 per cent GDP growth for 2021-22, there is still slack in the economy as the level of GDP will only be moderately above its pre-COVID level of 2019-20 GDP. In fact, the recent data release of GDP on August 31, 2021 suggests that the real GDP in Q1:2021-22 was well below the Q1:2019-20 level as well as the Q1:2018-19 level. We expect to exceed the pre-pandemic level of output only in Q3:2021-22. The second wave amplified the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on contact-intensive activities and increased pace of vaccination, however, contact-intensive activities which were earlier lagging in recovery are now catching up. Informal sector is likely to take even longer to recoup as the impact of the second wave on this sector was relatively more pronounced. The demand for MGNREGA \u2013 notwithstanding the sequential moderation in September \u2013 remains high partly reflecting persisting weakness in the informal sector. Durable recovery in manufacturing and services sectors should support revival in the informal economy. The future trajectory of growth, however, is strewn with many challenges, most notably from how the pandemic will evolve. Overall, growth remains critically dependent on policy support and needs nurturing for sustained recovery. the 65. In its August 2021 meeting, the MPC was faced with the challenges posed by headline inflation exceeding the upper tolerance threshold for the second successive month. The MPC then judged the inflation spike during May-June as transitory, driven largely by pandemic-induced supply bottlenecks and elevated commodity prices, and expected it to ease in the subsequent months. The actual inflation outcomes for July- August, with inflation registering a substantial moderation to move within the tolerance band, have vindicated the MPC\u2019s outlook and monetary policy stance. The MPC was faced with a similar dilemma in September-October last year due to food price shocks; and its judgement to see them as transitory and to look through it had proved to be right. Such an approach has been contributing significantly to the economic recovery and stability in the financial markets. Thus, the medium-term focus of the MPC has successfully moderated undue expectations of a possible reversal of the monetary policy stance and is helping anchor expectations in the right direction, while navigating the economic recovery from the crisis. 66. The more than expected softening of inflation in July and August this year was underpinned by the significant lowering in food price momentum, especially in August. Several factors have contributed to this. The summer seasonal vegetable price build-up this year was unusually low, close to a third of historical patterns. Supply side measures announced by the Government in recent months to meet the demand-supply gaps have helped to stabilise food prices. Core inflation, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel, however, remained elevated and sticky primarily on account of persistent inflationary pressures in transport and communication, health, clothing and footwear. 67. Going forward, if there are no spells of unseasonal rains, food inflation is likely to register significant moderation in the immediate term, aided by record kharif production, more than adequate food stocks, supply-side measures and favourable base effects. Volatile crude oil prices, particularly the resurgence since mid- September, is pushing pump prices to new highs, raising risk of further spillover of high transportation cost into retail prices of goods and services. On balance, the outlook on inflation has improved and inflation projection for 2021-22 has been revised downward by 40 bps to 5.3 per cent. 68. Against this backdrop, it is felt that continued monetary support is necessary as the economic recovery process even now is delicately poised and growth is yet to take firmer roots. The external environment, which had been supportive of aggregate demand over the past few months, may lose momentum for a variety of reasons such as \u2013 surge in infections; the persistence of pandemic-related supply bottlenecks; a binding shortage of key inputs like semi-conductors; and the spike in gas prices. Given an ever evolving and dynamic environment, with the outlook overcast by several uncertainties including the fact that the pandemic is far from over, we need to ensure that the nascent revival of economic activity shows signs of durability and sustainability. At this critical juncture, our actions have to be gradual, calibrated, well- timed and well-telegraphed to avoid any undue surprises. We are reaching the shore after sailing through a very turbulent journey, and we cannot afford to rock the boat at this crucial stage. We must ensure that we reach safely to begin the journey beyond the shore. I, therefore, vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to continue with the accommodative stance as spelt out by the MPC in its August 2021 meeting. In parallel, we remain laser-focused to bring back the CPI inflation to 4 per cent over a period of time in a non-disruptive manner.

According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 8, 2021) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the  keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. The reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting during October 6-8, 2021, surges of infections across geographies, emergence of the Omicron variant, the persistence of supply chain disruptions and elevated energy and commodity prices continue to weigh on global economic activity. Global merchandise trade is slowing after a sharp rebound from the pandemic due to the disruptions in port services and turnaround time, elevated freight rates and the global shortage of semiconductor chips, which could dampen future manufacturing output and trade. The composite global purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), however, improved to a four-month high in November, with services continuing to perform better than manufacturing for eight consecutive months. Commodity prices remain elevated across the board, though there has been some 7. softening since late October and further drop towards end-November following uncertainties from the new COVID-19 variant, among others. Headline inflation in several advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) has soared, prompting a number of central banks to continue tightening and others to bring forward policy normalisation. With the US Federal Reserve commencing tapering of its monthly asset purchases and the possibility of faster taper, renewed bouts of volatility and heightened uncertainties have unsettled global financial markets. Bond yields which had risen in most countries, responding to inflation and monetary policy actions, eased from the last week of November. The US dollar has been trading higher in recent weeks against both AE and EME currencies. 8. On the domestic front, data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on November 30, 2021 showed that real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 8.4 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2021-22, following a growth of 20.1 per cent during Q1:2021-22. With the recovery gaining momentum, all constituents of aggregate demand entered the expansion zone, with exports and imports markedly exceeding their pre-COVID-19 levels. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) increased by 8.5 per cent y-o-y during Q2:2021- 22. 9. Available data for Q3:2021-22 indicate that the momentum of economic activity is gaining further traction, aided by expanding vaccination coverage, the rapid subsiding of new infections and release of pent-up demand. Rural demand exhibited resilience \u2013 tractor sales improved in October over the same month of 2019 (pre-pandemic level), while motorcycle sales are slowly inching towards their pre-pandemic levels. Continued direct transfers under PM Kisan scheme are supporting rural demand. The demand for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) moderated in November from a year ago, suggesting a pickup in farm labour demand. Supported by favourable soil moisture content and good reservoir storage levels, rabi sowing was 6.1 per cent higher than a year ago as on December 3, 2021. 10. Urban demand and contact-intensive services activities are rebounding on improving consumer optimism, supported by festival demand. High-frequency indicators such as electricity demand, railway freight traffic, port cargo, toll collections, and petroleum consumption registered robust growth in October/November over the corresponding months of 2019. Automobile sales, steel consumption and air passenger traffic still remained below 2019 levels even though they gained momentum in October as supply side shortages eased. Investment activity is exhibiting modest signs of improvement \u2013 production of capital goods remained above pre-pandemic levels for the third month in a row during September, while import of capital goods in October rose at double-digit pace over its level two years ago. Prints of manufacturing and services PMIs for November 2021 suggested continued improvement in economic activity. Exports grew in November for the ninth month in a row, along with a surge in non-oil non-gold imports on the back of reviving domestic demand. 11. Headline CPI inflation, which has been on a downward trajectory since June 2021, edged up to 4.5 per cent in October from 4.3 per cent in September on account of a spike in vegetable prices \u2013 due to crop damage from heavy rainfalls in October in several states, and fuel inflation \u2013 driven up by international prices of liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene. In fact, fuel inflation at 14.3 per cent in October surged to an all-time high. Core inflation or CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated at 5.9 per cent during September-October with continuing upside pressures stemming from clothing and footwear, health, and transportation and communication sub-groups. Liquidity conditions remained in large surplus, with daily absorptions through the fixed 12. rate reverse repo and the variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) operations under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) averaging \u20b98.6 lakh crore in October-November. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 7.9 per cent (y-o-y) on December 3, 2021. Money supply (M3) and bank credit by commercial banks grew y-o-y by 9.5 per cent and 7.0 per cent respectively, as on November 19, 2021. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 58.9 billion in 2021-22 (up to December 3, 2021) to US$ 635.9 billion. The inflation trajectory, going forward, will be conditioned by a number of factors. The 13. flare-up in vegetables prices due to heavy rains in October and November is likely to reverse with the winter arrivals. Rabi sowing is progressing well and is set to exceed last year\u2019s acreage. Recent pro-active supply side interventions by the Government continue to restrain the pass- through of elevated international edible oil prices to domestic retail inflation. Crude prices have seen a significant correction in recent period. Cost-push pressures from high industrial raw material prices, transportation costs, and global logistics and supply chain bottlenecks continue to impinge on core inflation. The slack in the economy is muting the pass-through of rising input costs to output prices. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 5.3 per cent for 2021-22; 5.1 per cent in Q3; 5.7 per cent in Q4:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 5.0 per cent and for Q2 at 5.0 per cent (Chart 1). 14. The recovery in domestic economic activity is turning increasingly broad-based, with the expanding vaccination coverage, slump in fresh COVID-19 cases and rapid normalisation of mobility. Rural demand is expected to remain resilient. The spurt in contact-intensive activities and pent-up demand will continue to bolster urban demand. The government\u2019s infrastructure push, the widening of the performance-linked incentive scheme, structural reforms, recovering capacity utilisation and benign liquidity and financial conditions provide conducive conditions for private investment demand. The Reserve Bank\u2019s surveys point to improving business outlook and consumer confidence. On the other hand, volatile commodity prices, persisting global supply disruptions, new mutations of the virus and financial market 3 volatility pose downside risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration and assuming no resurgence in COVID-19 infections in India, the projection for real GDP growth is retained at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 consisting of 6.6 per cent in Q3; and 6.0 per cent in Q4:2021-22. Real GDP growth is projected at 17.2 per cent for Q1:2022-23 and at 7.8 per cent for Q2 (Chart 2). 15. The impact of the recent spike in vegetables prices on food inflation prints is expected to dissipate as the usual softening of prices in the winter sets in. The partial roll back of Central excise and State Value Added Taxes (VAT) on petrol and diesel in November have eased retail selling prices and will have second round effects over a period of time. Crude oil has seen some correction but remains volatile. Core inflation will need to be closely monitored and held in check. For a sustained lowering of core inflation, continuing the normalisation of excise duties and VATs alongside measures to address other input cost pressures assume critical importance, more so as demand improves. The domestic recovery is gaining traction, but activity is just about catching up with pre-pandemic levels and will have to be assiduously nurtured by conducive policy settings till it takes root and becomes self-sustaining. In particular, private investment has to lead the revival of the economy, along with the strong impetus being provided by exports. Private consumption, despite strong recovery in Q2:2021-22, remains below its pre-pandemic level and demand for contact-intensive services could potentially face headwinds if authorities take pre-emptive steps to contain the fallout of Omicron. Downside risks remain significant rendering the outlook highly uncertain, especially on account of global spillovers, the potential resurgence in COVID-19 infections with new mutations, persisting shortages and bottlenecks and the widening divergences in policy actions and stances across the world as inflationary pressures persist. A tightening of global financial conditions poses risks to global economic activity and to India\u2019s prospects as well. Against this backdrop, the MPC has judged that the ongoing domestic recovery needs sustained policy support to make it more broad-based. Considering it appropriate to wait for growth signals to become solidly entrenched while remaining watchful on inflation dynamics, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and to continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 4 17. All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das, except Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. 18. 17. All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K.

Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on December 22, 2021. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 7-9, 2022. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent 20. The quarterly GDP estimates by NSO for July-September 2021 point to a continued expansion of the economy, YOY basis, with GDP at constant prices rising by 8.4%, following the increase of 20.1% in Q1FY22. The Q2FY22 GDP estimates are higher than 7.9% projected in the October meeting of MPC. The GDP estimate also reflects growth of 10.4% over the previous quarter. While these are significant positive trends, there are new concerns on the growth front on account of the implications of the emergence of the new variants of the Corona virus and uncertainty of global growth and inflation scenarios. 21. In terms of the return of the economy to the pre-pandemic level, progress has been significant but sustained improvement of this performance is critical to the economy. In this context, GDP growth in Q2FY22 is only 0.3% over the pre-pandemic Q2FY20. The improvement needed to return to the pre-pandemic levels is also reflected in the estimates of final consumption expenditure and investment. Although Private Final Consumption Expenditure grew by 8.6% in Q2FY22 YOY basis in constant prices, it was 3.5% below Q2FY20 level. The Gross Fixed Capital Formation, in constant prices, increased YOY basis by 11% in Q2FY22 and rose only 1.5% over Q2FY20. The quarter- on- quarter improvements in PFCE and GFCF in Q2FY22 are indicators of momentum in the economy that needs to be sustained for achieving further expansion of the economy leading to employment and income growth. 22. At a broad level, output levels of the various sectors in Q2FY22 measured by GVA at constant prices are above Q2FY21. But there is also unevenness in growth performance reflecting sectoral and other structural variations in the adjustments taking place in the economy in the ongoing recovery process. In the case of \u2018Trade, hotels, transportation, communications and broadcasting services\u2019, which had a share of 20.3% in total GVA in 2019- 20, the gap from Q2FY20 is 9.2%. In general, the pace of output recovery in contact-intensive sectors is likely to be affected by both supply side constraints and weak demand, conditions which may abate only with further relief from the pandemic. The slower output growth is also 5 contributed by supply disruptions as in the case of semiconductor chips affecting particularly production of passenger cars and the travel restrictions affecting the aviation sector and the related businesses. The IIP for manufacturing has shown only a modest YOY growth of 3.1% in September 2021. The overall weak demand conditions are reflected in the RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey for November 2021, in which a large majority of the urban respondents presently remain cautious on \u2018incurring non-essential consumption expenditure\u2019. The private investment, an important component of aggregate demand would be a key 23. to sustaining the momentum of GDP growth. RBI\u2019s enterprise survey for November 2021 points to improvement in business outlook for Q3FY21 but majority of the respondents remain cautious. NCAER\u2019s Business Confidence Index based on a survey conducted in September registered improvement QOQ basis and also over Q2FY2020. The financial performance of the private corporate sector in Q2FY2022 suggests a steady growth in sales in Q2FY22 but investment indicators reflect a subdued investment activity. A key factor influencing the private investment in the manufacturing sectors appears to be the level of capacity utilisation, which is still below the long-term average reflecting both demand and supply constraints. While there are positive drivers such as FDI, the uncertainty surrounding the relief from the pandemic and global growth scenario are the other factors affecting caution in investment decisions. 24. 22, with normal rainfall conditions although they were also marked by uneven rainfall. Agricultural sector is expected to be supportive of the overall GDP growth in FY 2021- 25. The export growth in October-November 2021 has continued to support overall GDP growth. The NSO estimates of rupee value of exports of goods and services at constant prices in Q2FY22 are 19.6% higher on YOY basis, following an increase of 39.1% in Q1FY22. The merchandise exports in dollar value during April-November 2021-22 is 262.5 billion compared to 174.2 billion in the same period of 2020-21. Imports have also increased sharply YOY basis in H1FY22 partly indicating the rising domestic economic growth but also reflecting the price increase in some of the critical imports such as the petroleum imports. The global uncertainty on economic growth, resulting from fresh surges of Covid infections is a challenge in sustaining export performance in the short term. In its October 2021 World Economic Outlook, IMF lowered world GDP growth projections for 2021 compared to its projections in July 2021. Going further, the projected growth in 2022 is one percentage point lower than in 2021. A number of high frequency indicators of the economy do point to revival of the growth 26. momentum in Q2FY22 and the subsequent months of October and November 2021. PMIs, cement production, GST collections, E-way bills, domestic and international air traffic, housing launches, housing sales, Google mobility indices show robust performance YOY basis. The government revenue expenditure in Q2FY22 for the Centre and States registered double digit growth YOY basis. Indicators such as railway freight, motor spirits consumption show improvement YOY basis and remain above 2019-20 levels or catching up with them. Some of these indicators also show some deceleration in YOY growth in the recent months. Port traffic data shows moderate growth and has reached 2019-20 level in October 2021. The key financial sector indicators, deposit and commercial credit by the banking sector, have shown steady improvement during 2021-22. RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters for November 2021 provides a median 27. forecast of YOY GDP growth for FY2021-22 at 9.5%, a slight upward revision from the September 2021 forecast of 9.4% with significant improvement in the growth of industrial output balanced by slower services growth. Based on the present trends and patterns of indicators of growth, and actual growth estimates for Q1 and Q2, the YOY GDP growth for 2021-22 has been retained at 9.5%. The growth rates for Q3 and Q4 for the present financial year are projected at 6.6% and 6.0%, respectively. Achieving these growth projections in the face of concerns over the new variants of 28. Corona virus and the return from accommodative monetary policy in the advanced economies suggest a need for policy measures supportive of growth drivers. The inflation pressure measured in terms of YOY headline CPI in October is at 4.5 per 29. cent, slightly higher than 4.3 per cent in September. CPI Food, YOY basis is at 1.8%, fuel at 14.3% and CPI core (excluding food and fuel) is at 5.9%. In the case of Food and Fuel, the YOY increase in October is higher than in September 2021 and remains more or less at its level in September and October 2021 in the case of core inflation. Between July and October 2021, the core inflation has remained at 5.8-5.9% in each month. CPI Fuel increased by 12.4% in July 2021 YOY basis, rising steadily reaching 14.3% in October. Food inflation dropped from 4.5% in July to 1.8% in October 2021. While the retail prices of fuel are affected by the various taxes and subsidies, it may be noted that average YOY increase in Brent crude oil prices in dollar value during October 2021 exceeded 100%. The rising fuel prices are clearly driving the cost of energy and transportation costs in every other sector. In the RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys of October-December 2021 covering manufacturing, services and infrastructure sectors, a large majority of the respondents report cost increase and also increase in selling prices. The pickup in economic activity has also increased demand for inputs leading to higher prices to the consumer. 30. Taking into account the patterns of changes in prices in different components of CPI, the headline inflation rate for Q3 and Q4 is now projected at 5.1% and 5.7%, respectively and 5.3% for FY2021-22 as a whole. The high level of core inflation is a concern that affects both consumption expenditure and profitability of firms. Sustained improvement in output will require reduction in inflation rate achieved through easing of supply constraints and productivity improvement to revive consumer and investment demand. While there is ample liquidity in the system, bank credit to commercial sector as a ratio to money supply (M3) remains below the levels seen during 2019-20. Full transition from the two major disruptions inflicted by the pandemic on the supply and demand systems to normalcy will require policy support to both output growth and ease inflation pressures. In view of the projected growth and inflation rates and the emerging uncertainty from 31. the renewed surge of Covid infections and macroeconomic adjustments at a global level, I vote in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. I also vote in favour of continuing with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 32. Global risks are rising with the Omicron variant as well as with expectations of an earlier Fed taper. Markets are volatile as are oil prices. In such circumstances it is better for the MPC to remain steady and watchful through the next couple of months. International oil prices may fall further after the winter season. Their high volatility means collapse is possible. Some analysts expect an unwinding of demand because excess inventories were built for festival demand. 33. While US inflation is now expected to be less temporary because of the large fiscal stimulus and withdrawal from the labour force, these conditions do not hold in India. The differential between Indian and US real rates is high because of higher US inflation, so some Fed tightening in future does not necessarily require our policy rates to rise. 34. Indian household inflation expectations have fallen steeply in end November compared to their rise in early November following governments\u2019 cut in fuel taxes and softening of international oil prices. The expectations are at or below their September levels. Firms\u2019 price expectations have also somewhat reduced. Although core inflation is elevated the major share 35. Government\u2019s critical and just in time supply-side side action has enabled monetary policy accommodation. In the post Covid-19 world of supply shocks and high government debt monetary-fiscal coordination has become acceptable in advanced economies (AEs), while earlier it was regarded as compromising monetary policy independence. But a flexible inflation targeting regime has to respond to demand-side inflation and to supply-side inflation that has second round effects. This ensures central bank independence and contributes to anchor inflation expectations. Coordination is consistent with central bank independence since low rates are conditional on supply-side action. 36. In India, moreover, coordination normally does better because supply shocks dominate inflation and can be better influenced by state action. Monetary policy has more space to affect demand, while high debt and interest payments constrain fiscal spending. Policy rates can adjust more easily to appropriately fine-tune demand, watching to see if exports and pent-up demand moderate, or if there is overheating and persistent inflation. Research shows that monetary transmission to output is effective in Indian conditions1. 37. A semi-structural estimation with gap variables obtains an interest elasticity of aggregate demand (-0.21) as high as in AEs. This is intuitive because consumer durable and housing loan demand is interest elastic and induces demand for working capital and investment funds. Covid-19 naturally led to postponement of projects, as uncertainty increased and consumer confidence fell, so that time is required for revival. Even so investment in specific sectors did rise in 2020 itself, following softer monetary-financial conditions. By October 2021 there was a perceptible rise in credit. Although credit growth to overall industry was only 4%, that to medium industries was 48.6%. Large industries are deleveraged, cash rich and have access to the corporate bond market. Credit to MSMEs and personal loans grew above 11%, with that to consumer durables at 44%. 38. Q2 GDP data also shows signs of investment revival. Aggregate GDP has passed 2019 levels, but consumption and stressed sectors remain below it pointing to income loss that still has to be made-up. Excess capacity and unemployment continues to be high. Potential output is difficult to measure in the Indian context2 and is best defined by a persistent rise in inflation above the tolerance band, which is not the case at present, implying the output gap is negative. Real rates are less negative, to the extent one year ahead inflation projections have softened. 39. Estimated Indian aggregate supply shows a mixture of backward and forward looking behaviour. When there are some lags, stability requires monetary policy to respond early but slowly3. There is steady progress in fine-tuning and control of liquidity since early this year. Since the share of VRRR has gone up, the weighted average reverse repo rate is higher and some other short rates have risen. Additions to durable liquidity have stopped. But the next step is to decrease excess durable liquidity itself. Some of this will be absorbed as growth rises. Banks are already raising some deposit rates in anticipation of a rise in credit. Even as excess aggregate liquidity reduces, RBI policies targeting liquidity at stressed sectors must continue. In view of these considerations I vote to continue with the current stance and repo rate. 1 Goyal, A. and S.

My views have not changed much since the August and October statements. I believe that monetary policy is no longer the right instrument to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic whose economic effects (as opposed to its health effects) have diminished greatly and become more concentrated in narrow pockets of the economy. There is no evidence so far to suggest that the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus would change the picture materially. Economic activity appears to have surpassed its pre-pandemic level, continued 42. recovery is likely during the rest of 2021-22, and the prognosis is for healthy growth in 2022- 23 as well. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence of inflation becoming persistent in the upper region of the tolerance band, though it is projected to remain within the band. 43. In this environment, it is no longer appropriate to stick to the monetary policy stance first adopted in May 2020 when the adverse economic effects of the pandemic were at their peak. I am therefore not in favour of the decision to keep the reverse repo rate at 3.35%, and vote against the accommodative stance. Raising effective money market rates quickly towards 4% would demonstrate the MPC\u2019s commitment to the inflation target, help anchor expectations, reduce risk premia, enhance macroeconomic stability, and allow lower long-term interest rates to be sustained for longer thereby aiding the economic recovery. 44. On the other hand, I vote for maintaining the repo rate at 4% for the following reasons. Economic growth was unsatisfactory long before the pandemic, and even if the economic ill effects of the pandemic abate to some extent, substantial monetary accommodation is warranted. The repo rate of 4% corresponds to a negative real rate in the range of 1-1.5% based on forward looking inflation forecasts. In my view, this level of rates is currently appropriate for reviving economic growth without excessive risk of an inflationary spiral. Needless to say, the MPC needs to remain data driven so that it can respond rapidly and adequately to any unforeseen shocks that may arise in future. Statement by Dr. Mridul K. Saggar 45. At the October MPC, I had cautioned on the likelihood of significant headwinds from the shifting global macro-economic conditions. The Fed start of taper last month was at an envisaged pace as guided by it in September and as expected by the financial markets. However, there were three surprises since our last meeting. First, inflation in the US and across the globe surprised on the up indicating that inflation may persist longer than what may be traditionally viewed as \u201ctransitory\u201d. Second, supply-side disruptions seem to be elongated and spilling over to several geographies running through oil, gas, minerals and metals and, together with climatic factors, is lately spilling over to agro-space in a significant manner reflected in food and fertiliser prices climbing up. Third, these two factors have combined to contribute to higher inflation and lower growth prospects, raising spectre of stagflationary impulses globally. 46. The uncertainties regarding each of these factors have risen markedly in recent period. Equities markets may see more of volatile adjustments of the type seen in the last week of November as analysts adjust multiples to the changed macroeconomic environment. Bonds steepening trades in the belly of the curve will contribute to flattening of the yield curve but will also generate cross-border trades which can cause portfolio outflows. These volatilities can spillover to exchange rates. Markets are already turbulent trying to price risks emanating from the high transmissibility and spike mutations of Omicron variant, some of which are already materialising in the form of fresh travel bans and intensified protocols to contain its spread. The risk to global growth in my view has already surfaced from the rapid rise in new Covid infections in Europe and the U.S, with the 7-day Moving Averages of daily new confirmed Covid-19 cases standing in the vicinity of 3.70 lakh and 1.20 lakh, respectively. The situation remains alarming. It is clear, that the pandemic is far from over yet, though learning effects and vaccinations will help us cope with it better. So, where is the global economy 9 headed? In my view the risk of a return to stagflation of the 1970s is rather remote. However, global growth is slowing once more and central banks, including ours, will need to confront the inflation challenge with careful calibration and avoid impulses that may kindle or deepen stagflationary impulses. In my judgement, these impulses should be mild one but could turn into a moderate one if monetary policy is not well-calibrated. Policy errors in either direction on the part of the central banks at this stage are laden with serious risks. Let me turn to India. Growth is picking up. The Q2:2021-22 GDP and GVA were 0.3 47. per cent and 0.5 per cent above the pre-pandemic Q2:2019-20. On the demand side, PFCE was slightly less (-3.5%) than pre-pandemic Q2, while gross capital formation was 7.8 per cent above it. On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities and all three sectors of industry were above the pre-pandemic levels, while services sector (including construction) was only 2.2 per cent below pre-pandemic Q2. Only trade, hotels, transport, communication and broadcasting services remained markedly below pre-pandemic Q2 (-9.2 per cent). Information from business sources suggests that hotel occupancy and restaurant utilisation rates, though improving, are just half of the pre-pandemic levels. Tourism and travel are faring even worse. This is also an indicator to suggest that informal sector faces an uphill task in normalising production. Overall, out of the 59 high frequency indicators that have become available for October 48. out of 67 that I track, 88 per cent of the indicators exhibited month-on-month improvement after a somewhat weak August and September. The momentum towards normalisation has picked up significantly, but a third of indicators have yet to cross their pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, the stress in informal sector is not adequately captured by these indicators. 49. On the consumption side, trade reports suggest that Diwali sales jumped 71 per cent this year compared with 17 per cent, 20 per cent and 16 per cent in the preceding three years. On the investment side, partial information for Q2 and informal feedback obtained from corporates and banks suggest that capacity utilization rates in manufacturing have improved and is likely to have crossed 70 per cent mark but will likely remain slightly below trend levels in Q3:2021-22. Though the pipeline investment from last year is weak, there is anecdotal evidence of new projects that are or can soon get into financial closures. The road sector stands out, but some investment is also seen in cement, iron and steel, textiles, solar power, chemical and chemical products. 50. On the inflation, the momentum in October was strong. CPI increased 1.4 per cent month-on-month in October, which is more than double the normal momentum. Seasonally adjusted annualised rate of CPI inflation touched 10.0 per cent and item level data indicates pickup in diffusion. Passthrough from WPI inflation will need to be closely watched with October momentum reaching an all-time high at 2.3 per cent month-on-month. Diffusion of price rise was also high at the wholesale price level. Core inflation remains elevated and sticky. In this milieu, we need to be eagle-eyed for the passthrough of producer prices to retail levels and be ready to act should the need arise. If growth improves further, we should use the opportunity to nudge inflation and inflation expectations down. 51. I finally turn to decisions at hand in this meeting. With inflation having bottomed out, the real interest rate adjustment assumes added importance. Macroeconomic adjustments of saving-investment balance will be critical as global interest rate cycle changes in face of tapers and lift offs. While we are very close to growth having revived, its durability is still not entirely clear. On the other hand, inflation has come back below upper tolerance level for the last four months and while the upside risks exist, the baseline affords some comfort that inflation should stay mid-way between the target and the upper tolerance band in H1:2022-23. If one were certain about a broad-based durable growth revival, monetary policy could have acted now to pre-empt the possibility of inflation resurgence. However, the key question is whether the economy can entail the output sacrifice it may bring at a time when the recovery is nascent. Therefore, it will be best not to risk strengthening stagflationary impulses that already are being 10 propped up by supply disruptions mentioned upfront in my statement. Small moves towards policy normalisation may be sufficient now and one can decide to shift to a tightening monetary policy cycle at a point when it is clear that demand revival has acquired resilience and pandemic risks to growth have diminished or alternatively if inflation diffusion persists in near months which then can result in inflation getting generalised and persist next year, especially if inflation expectations get unanchored. Short-run Phillips curve can shift up and turn steeper in this case. Yet, at this juncture, it looks India will be able to contain inflationary pressures through better supply-side responses. 52. One month\u2019s data suggesting strong growth and inflation momentums is not sufficient to change rate cycles or policy stance. This guiding rule has helped us avert the mistake of premature tightening on at least two earlier occasions. This, however, does not mean status quo. Central bank has an armoury of tools to calibrate monetary and financial conditions. The Pascal\u2019s principle for transmission of fluid pressures very much holds and appropriate liquidity levels are key to monetary adjustment at this stage. This is also important to address unintended effects reflected in asset prices inflation, income inequalities and future risks of macro-financial imbalances. Keeping in view the Swiss knife-like policy tools the central bank possesses to deal appropriately with the emerging trends, I vote to leave the repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent and also vote for retaining the stance. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 53. Suddenly, the global outlook has darkened. Three fundamental questions about Omicron have put national authorities on high alert \u2013 is it more transmissible than other variants? Can it evade immunity conferred by previous infections or vaccination? Does it cause more severe disease? As countries race to contain Omicron with travel restraints and new quarantine and 54. social distancing measures, the global recovery and the inflation outlook are at risk again. Even before Omicron, the momentum of the global recovery and of world trade has 55. been ebbing in the second half of 2021, including in countries with relatively high vaccination rates. With GDP prints coming in lower for several countries, estimates suggest that global GDP growth is slowing by a full percentage point in the second half of 2021 on a sequential seasonally adjusted annualised basis. In some countries, the level of GDP may have reached pre-pandemic levels, but that is of little comfort as activity worldwide had been slowing since 2018. In many other countries, negative output and employment gaps are still too wide, and that is sapping global aggregate demand. The path of the recovery is still being shaped by the pandemic and its second order effects. The question that is uppermost is: Has the global recovery peaked prematurely, leaving behind the scars of the pandemic? Fears about the new variant triggered the biggest Black Friday plunge on record in 56. global equity markets on November 26, 2021. Even earlier, financial market volatility had surged in recent weeks on fears of a policy pivot towards faster normalisation. Clearly, financial conditions are highly fragile, vulnerable to volatile shifts and not conducive to a strong and broad-based recovery. 57. The pretext underlying financial market volatility \u2013 what I term the cynicism of bonds and the \u2018fomo\u2019 of equities \u2013 is that inflation has checked in as if it is here to stay. In some countries, the dogs of second order transmission have begun to bark \u2013 wages; rents; education fees; transportation costs. The world helplessly stares at what have become household terms - supply and logistics disruptions, shortages and bottlenecks \u2013 but the need of the hour is coordinated action. Consequently, markets and analysts get increasingly certain that inflation may remain elevated through the greater part of 2022 and growth will slow further absent policy action to unclog supply bottlenecks. 11 58. Yet, it is important to be cognisant of the bullwhip effect \u2013 when shortages turn into surpluses. Some evidence of this happening is already there. Finished goods inventories are piling up as shown in PMIs of several advanced countries and promises of discounts, sales and faster deliveries are getting louder. When these inventories will be wound down, they will reduce new orders and economic activity will slow. An excess of finished goods may also lead to weak pricing power, which will moderate inflation. It is likely that this will happen in the first half of 2022. Meanwhile, final private consumption expenditure seems to be weakening in individual countries\u2019 data releases. India\u2019s November 30 release was no exception. 59. As far as the emerging markets as an asset class are concerned, the ebbing of yields globally during April-June this year seemed to suggest that markets had priced in the inevitability of monetary policy normalisation by systemic central banks, but the recent volatility has dispelled that comfort. Most emerging market currencies have depreciated, with retrenchment in capital flows amplifying the downswing. As macroeconomic conditions diverge further across countries, monetary policy actions and stances are getting dissonant, tightening global financial conditions and putting the global recovery further at risk. 60. The Indian economy has been treading a trajectory that diverges from the global situation. Bank credit is picking up, tax revenues are buoyant, exports are growing robustly and the current account balance is set to swing into a deficit on the back of strong import demand, but there are limits to decoupling. There are vulnerabilities too. The level of GDP in Q2:2021- 22 is barely at the so-called pre-pandemic level of Q2:2019-20, which itself grew at the slowest pace in 6 years preceding it. Consumption spending is held back by households hesitant to incur discretionary expenditure. Private investment remains timid and is yet to participate in the recovery. Contact-intensive services are still convalescing from the wounds of the pandemic. In November, several high frequency indicators have slowed, suggesting that the second half of 2021-22 may not be the same as the first half and moderation in the recovery could set in. 61. On inflation, food inflation may ease with the usual winter softening, but core inflation will keep us awake, especially with the likely cost push from recent upward revisions of telecom tariffs and GST rates on clothing and footwear, the safe haven upswing in gold prices and the increasing likelihood of selling price revisions in respect of consumer durables, automobiles and the like by January 2022. India\u2019s inflation developments reflect a scissor effect \u2013 rebound in demand colliding with supply bottlenecks; but shipping delays, delivery lags and semi-conductor shortages cannot last indefinitely and should certainly improve in the second half of 2022, as predicted by the IMF. The surge of pent-up demand should also normalise by then. Accordingly, elevated levels of inflation will persist till then, whether we like it or not, but not longer. By the projections, inflation in India will peak in the last quarter of this year and from there, it will moderate. 62. India is being lashed by global spillovers. The main conduit has been financial markets so far but the channels themselves are diversifying. The biggest risk of contagion is now from the new variant. Unless a clearer picture emerges on the near-term outlook, we must take guard and resume battle readiness again. In this highly unsettled environment, my vote for status quo on the policy rate and the accommodative stance as articulated in the resolution is fait accompli. 63. Since the previous meeting of the MPC (October 6-8, 2021), domestic growth and inflation have unfolded broadly on projected lines, while the global environment has turned febrile. Risks stalking the global economy have amplified with rapid spread of the virus mutations, including the Omicron variant, leading to countries scrambling for restrictions. Concomitantly, sharp escalation in inflationary pressures across several major advanced economies is prompting their central banks to hasten winding down of their ultra- accommodative policies, which may impart volatility to the financial markets with associated spill overs for emerging market economies (EMEs) like India. These developments certainly have two major takeaways for central bankers. First, uncertainty is emerging as the only certainty with which central bankers will have to deal with in the period ahead. Second, since monetary policy is at an inflection point, the journey of monetary policy which is hardly smooth in the best of times, is going to get more challenging. These two factors necessitate judicious policy choices amidst trade-offs. Against this backdrop, let me set out my assessment. 64. The Indian economy is facing several headwinds emanating from global factors \u2013 some old ones getting prolonged compared with the initial assessment, coupled with new ones. The supply disruptions and other bottlenecks which were earlier anticipated to resolve by end of this year have gained additional shelf life stretching into 2022. Global trade, after rebounding strongly in the first half of 2021, is losing momentum on the back of stretched supply chain and logistics issues, shortages of key components and slowdown in key regions. The emergence of the Omicron variant may cast some shadow on the momentum of contact-intensive services that were just showing signs of recovery in recent months. The threat of Omicron is also imparting additional volatility to the financial markets. 65. While the Indian economy is on its way to achieve the projected growth of 9.5 per cent in 2021-22, there are still significant areas of concern. Private consumption \u2013 the mainstay of aggregate demand with a share of around 55 per cent \u2013 is languishing below its level recorded two years ago, suggesting that we still have a distance to go in nurturing a more durable recovery. Private sector capex remains sluggish even though pre-conditions for its acceleration have been engendered by increasing capacity utilisation, deleveraging of balance sheets and improved profitability of corporates. Based on the early results, capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector increased to 68.8 per cent in Q2:2021-22 from 60.0 per cent in Q1:2021- 22. As corporates get ready to invest, congenial financial conditions need to be in place to boost business sentiment. As regards inflation, headline CPI after moderating sharply in September to 4.3 per 66. cent, edged up in October to 4.5 per cent. On the domestic front, October saw unusually heavy rains, which led to loss of kharif crops as well as delayed harvest. This resulted in a flare up of vegetables prices. CPI fuel inflation continued to be in double digits with domestic LPG and kerosene prices being raised in response to increase in international prices. These price pressures in food and fuel resulted in a pick-up in CPI inflation in October despite large favourable base effects. Core inflation remained elevated. Going forward, the heavy rainfalls in November are likely to keep vegetables prices 67. elevated in the near-term; however, prices thereafter are expected to register seasonal declines on fresh winter arrivals. The recent supply side interventions by the Government would continue to restrain the pass-through of elevated international edible oil prices to domestic retail inflation. The outlook on cereals and pulses is also favourable with healthy progress of rabi sowing. Retail selling prices of fuel eased somewhat in early November with reduction in excise duty and VAT on petrol and diesel, which should lead to a durable reduction in inflation through both direct and indirect effects. This should also be supported by the fall in international crude oil prices observed towards end-November, albeit to the extent that it is passed on to the retail pump prices. The revision in mobile tariffs, however, would be an additional source of price pressures on core inflation from December 2021. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to moderate to 5.0 per cent in H1 of next financial year, remaining well within the tolerance band. 68. We, however, need to remain vigilant to incipient cost-push pressures to inflation as well as to the uncertainty imparted by Omicron. Its implication for inflation, going forward, are two-fold. First, increase in restrictions, if any, on activity and commerce to stymie COVID- 19 spread could translate to continuing supply chain and logistics disruptions. Second, if the 69. To sum up, there is growing uncertainty regarding the evolving global macroeconomic outlook. In the domestic front, even as the prospects for economic activity are improving, there is still a slack with key drivers like private consumption remaining well below their pre- pandemic levels. Given these uncertainties, continued policy support is warranted for a durable, broad-based and self-sustaining rebound, especially to nurture revival in sectors which are lagging and to safeguard those which are exposed to the evolving headwinds. In this scenario, it would be prudent to watch out for growth signals becoming well entrenched while remaining vigilant on inflation dynamics. There is also a necessity to have a firm understanding of the impact of the Omicron variant. The calibration and timing of a monetary policy response and preventing build-up of financial stability risks are very important in such an uncertain environment. Thus, I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and to continue with the same accommodative stance as spelt out by the MPC in its October 2021 meeting. ", "file_4": "The thirty third meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from February 8 to 10, 2022. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector industrial, services and the outlook performance, credit conditions, infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (February 10, 2022) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. The reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting in December 2021, the rapid spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant and the associated restrictions have dampened global economic activity. The global composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) slipped to an 18 month low of 51.4 in January 2022, with weakness in both services and manufacturing. World merchandise trade continues to grow. There are, however, headwinds emanating from persistent container and labour shortages, and elevated freight rates. In its January 2022 update of the World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised global output and trade growth projections for 2022 downward to 4.4 per cent and 6.0 per cent from its earlier forecasts of 4.9 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively. 7. After reversing the transient correction that had occurred towards end- November, commodity prices resumed hardening and accentuated inflationary pressures. With several central banks focused on policy normalisation, including ending asset purchases and earlier than expected hikes in policy rates, financial markets have turned volatile. Sovereign bond yields firmed up across maturities and equity markets entered correction territory. Currency markets in emerging market economies (EMEs) have exhibited two-way movements in recent weeks, driven by strong capital outflows from equities with elevated uncertainty on the pace and quantum of US rate hikes. The latter also led to an increasing and volatile movement in US bond yields. Domestic Economy 8. The first advance estimates (FAE) of national income released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on January 7, 2022 placed India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 9.2 per cent for 2021-22, surpassing its pre-pandemic (2019-20) level. All major components of GDP exceeded their 2019-20 levels, barring private consumption. In its January 31 release, the NSO revised real GDP growth for 2020-21 to (-) 6.6 per cent from the provisional estimates of (-) 7.3 per cent. Available high frequency indicators suggest some weakening of demand in 9. January 2022 reflecting the drag on contact-intensive services from the fast spread of the Omicron variant in the country. Rural demand indicators \u2013 two-wheeler and tractor sales \u2013 contracted in December-January. Area sown under Rabi up to February 4, 2022 was higher by 1.5 per cent over the previous year. Amongst the urban demand indicators, consumer durables and passenger vehicle sales contracted in November-December on account of supply constraints while domestic air traffic weakened in January under the impact of Omicron. Investment activity displayed a mixed picture \u2013 while import of capital goods increased in December, production of capital goods declined on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis in November. Merchandise exports remained buoyant for the eleventh successive month in January 2022; non-oil non-gold imports also continued to expand on the back of domestic demand. The manufacturing PMI stayed in expansion zone in January at 54.0, though it 10. moderated from 55.5 in the preceding month. Among services sector indicators, railway freight traffic, e-way bills, and toll collections posted y-o-y growth in December-January; petroleum consumption registered muted growth and port traffic declined. While finished steel consumption contracted y-o-y in January, cement production grew in double digits in December. PMI services continued to exhibit expansion at 51.5 in January 2022, though the pace weakened from 55.5 in December. 11. Headline CPI inflation edged up to 5.6 per cent y-o-y in December from 4.9 per cent in November due to large adverse base effects. The food group registered a significant decline in prices in December, primarily on account of vegetables, meat and fish, edible oils and fruits, but sharp adverse base effects from vegetables prices resulted in a rise in y-o-y inflation. Fuel inflation eased in December but remained in double digits. Core inflation or CPI inflation excluding food and fuel stayed elevated, though there was some moderation from 6.2 per cent in November to 6.0 per cent in December, driven by transportation and communication, health, housing and recreation and amusement. 12. Overall system liquidity continued to be in large surplus, although average absorption (through both the fixed and variable rate reverse repos) under the LAF declined from \u20b98.6 lakh crore during October-November 2021 to \u20b97.6 lakh crore in January 2022. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 8.4 per cent (y-o-y) on February 4, 2022. Money supply (M3) and bank credit by commercial banks rose (y-o-y) by 8.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent, respectively, as on January 28, 2022. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 55 billion in 2021-22 (up to February 4, 2022) to US$ 632 billion. Outlook 13. Since the December 2021 MPC meeting, CPI inflation has moved along the expected trajectory. Going forward, vegetables prices are expected to ease further on fresh winter crop arrivals. The softening in pulses and edible oil prices is likely to continue in response to strong supply-side interventions by the Government and increase in domestic production. Prospects of a good Rabi harvest add to the optimism on the food price front. Adverse base effect, however, is likely to prevent a substantial easing of food inflation in January. The outlook for crude oil prices is rendered uncertain by geopolitical developments even as supply conditions are expected to turn more favourable during 2022. While cost-push pressures on core inflation may continue in the near term, the Reserve Bank surveys point to some softening in the pace of increase in selling prices by the manufacturing and services firms going forward, reflecting subdued pass-through. On balance, the inflation projection for 2021-22 is retained at 5.3 per cent, with Q4 at 5.7 per cent. On the assumption of a normal monsoon in 2022, CPI inflation for 2022-23 is projected at 4.5 per cent with Q1:2022-23 at 4.9 per cent; Q2 at 5.0 per cent; Q3 at 4.0 per cent; and Q4:2022-23 at 4.2 per cent, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). 14. Recovery in domestic economic activity is yet to be broad-based, as private consumption and contact-intensive services remain below pre-pandemic levels. Going forward, the outlook for the Rabi crop bodes well for agriculture and rural demand. The impact of the ongoing third wave of the pandemic on the recovery is likely to be limited relative to the earlier waves, improving the outlook for contact- intensive services and urban demand. The announcements in the Union Budget 2022-23 on boosting public infrastructure through enhanced capital expenditure are expected to augment growth and crowd in private investment through large multiplier effects. The pick-up in non-food bank credit, supportive monetary and liquidity conditions, sustained buoyancy in merchandise exports, improving capacity utilisation and stable business outlook augur well for aggregate demand. Global financial market volatility, elevated international commodity prices, especially crude oil, and continuing global supply-side disruptions pose downside risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, the real GDP growth for 2022-23 is projected at 7.8 per cent with Q1:2022-23 at 17.2 per cent; Q2 at 7.0 per cent; Q3 at 4.3 per cent; and Q4:2022-23 at 4.5 per cent (Chart 2). The MPC notes that inflation is likely to moderate in H1:2022-23 and move 15. closer to the target rate thereafter, providing room to remain accommodative. Timely and apposite supply side measures from the Government have substantially helped contain inflationary pressures. The potential pick up of input costs is a contingent risk, especially if international crude oil prices remain elevated. The pace of the domestic recovery is catching up with pre-pandemic trends, but private consumption is still lagging. COVID-19 continues to impart some uncertainty to the future outlook. Measures announced in the Union Budget 2022-23 should boost aggregate demand. The global macroeconomic environment is, however, characterised by deceleration in global demand in 2022, with increasing headwinds from financial market volatility induced by monetary policy normalisation in the systemic advanced economies (AEs) and inflationary pressures from persisting supply chain disruptions. Accordingly, the MPC judges that the ongoing domestic recovery is still incomplete and needs continued policy support. It is in this context that the MPC has decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and to continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 16. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. 17. All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das, except Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during April 6-8, 2022. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent 20. The First Advance Estimates (FAE) released by NSO place the GDP growth in 2021-22 at 9.2 per cent over the previous year, lower than the projected 9.5 per cent in the December MPC statement. However, the First Revised Estimates (FRE) for 2020-21 released subsequent to the FAE point to slightly higher level of GDP than the Provisional Estimates used for calculating the FAE for 2021-22 implying lower projected growth rate for 2021-22. Overall, GDP in 2021-22 is likely to exceed the level achieved in 2019-20 by less than 2 per cent highlighting the need for accelerating the pace of economic recovery. 21. The FAE for 2021-22 show that the private consumption expenditure, the largest component of GDP, is yet to reach the pre-pandemic 2019-20 level. Two other components - government final consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation in 2021-22 are projected to exceed the 2019-20 levels. Exports and imports of goods and services are projected to rise in 2021-22 above their 2019-20 levels. 22. Even as the pace of growth appeared to be on track at the end of November, with the Covid situation again turning uncertain, policy measures have become crucial to sustain the growth momentum. The dominant impact of the latest state of the pandemic, directly or indirectly, has emerged from the global scenario. The direct impact is the significant caseload across countries and the restrictions on economic activities to contain the disease spread. The indirect impact follows as the spill overs of the initial impact through the supply chains, inflation and monetary policy tightening to contain inflation are realised. The YOY rate of growth of the world economy in 2022 is now projected by IMF in its January 2022 update of the World Economic Outlook at 4.4 per cent, compared to 4.9 per cent in October 2021. Going forward, growth is projected at 3.8 per cent in 2023. Globally, inflationary pressures from fuel and food are expected to abate during 2022-23. The January 2022 update by IMF also projects the World trade volume - goods and services - to grow in 2022 at a lower rate than the previous October 2021 projections. The projections also recognise the downside risks to growth related to the spread of Covid. 23. geopolitical risks that may in turn affect trade, prices and capital flows. the continued 24. The domestic economy has shown strong recovery from the impact of the second wave of the pandemic in Q1: 2021-22. The growth recovery, however, has been incomplete so far, particularly with respect to private consumption expenditure. RBI\u2019s bi-monthly Consumer Confidence Survey conducted in the major urban areas across the country in January, reflects continued weakness in consumer sentiments compared to the survey in November 2021. Majority of the respondents report increased spending now compared to a year back, with \u2018essential expenditure\u2019 driving the increase and \u2018discretionary expenditure\u2019 remaining weak. The pattern is the same for expectations of one-year-ahead situation. Although slightly higher proportion of respondents now find improvement in the prevailing general economic conditions compared to a year back, majority find that the situation has worsened. The one year ahead assessment by the respondents reflects decline in positive ratings, probably due to the impact of rise in the infections from the Omicron variant during December 2021. Perceptions of the prevailing employment and income conditions also reflect weak sentiments. The mixed picture on consumer spending is also reflected in the pattern of Index of Industrial Production (IIP). The IIP for consumer durables is yet to rise above the 2019-20 levels in a significant way. The IIP for consumer nondurables has just reached 2019-20 level. Overall, boost to the consumption spending would require sustained improvement in employment and income conditions. December 26. While the current wave of Covid infections has affected consumer and business sentiments, there are also indicators that suggest underlying positive growth trends. GST collection has registered double digit growth in December 2021 and January 2022, although at a much slower pace than in October-November 2021. Non-food bank credit expanded by 9.3 per cent in December 2021, year on year basis and by 8.1 per cent as on January 14, 2022. These are the highest rates of growth in the last 12 months. The PMI for manufacturing and services, while declining from the levels of previous month, remain in expansion zone for the month of January 2022. 27. The growth momentum of domestic economy is expected to pick up as the impact of the current wave of the pandemic subsides. The vaccinations and continued adherence to Covid protocols to prevent any further spread of the virus are essential for achieving sustained growth in employment and household income. 28. Based on the assumption of a normal monsoon, and the present trends in the key indicators of economic activity, GDP growth for 2022-23 is placed at 7.8 per cent, YOY basis. The quarterly growth trajectory is projected as Q1:2022-23 at 17.2 per cent; Q2 at 7.0 per cent; Q3 at 4.3 per cent; and Q4:2022-23 at 4.5 per cent, YOY basis. The Survey of Professional Forecasters, conducted by RBI in January 2022 provides a median GDP forecast of 7.7 per cent for 2022-23. Applying the forecast of 7.8 per cent on 2021-22 FAE value for GDP, implies an increase of 9.6 per cent over the Second Revised Estimates for 2019-20 or an average annual growth of 3.2 per cent for the three years ending 2022-23. This highlights the need for supportive policies for achieving a sustained higher growth momentum. 29. The CPI headline inflation rate for the first three quarters of 2021-22 has come at 5.6, 5.1 and 5.0 per cent YOY basis. The non-Food and non-Fuel Core CPI inflation rate for the same periods has been at 6.0, 5.8 and 6.0 per cent. The CPI core measure, which includes the prices of petrol and diesel as well as the prices of transportation services, captures the cost of retail selling prices of petrol and diesel as well as its cost passed on in the prices of the other products in the consumption basket. The double-digit growth of prices in the petroleum products, therefore, is one of the key drivers of the Core inflation as well. Going forward, the trajectories of food and petroleum product prices would impact the prices of the other sectors, besides the other sector-specific factors. The Inflation Expectations Survey of Households conducted by the RBI in the first two weeks of January 22 shows a decline in the median of expected inflation rate on three months ahead and one-year ahead horizons. Perceptions of current inflation rate also declined. Although the perceived inflation rates are high compared to the actuals, changes in these perceived rates point to expectations of moderation in inflation rate. Taking into account the present trends, and the favourable impact of the Rabi crop conditions, the inflation projection for 2021-22 is retained at 5.3 per cent. The projected inflation rate for Q4 is at 5.7 per cent, the same as in the December 2021 projections. The median forecast of CPI inflation rate in the Survey of Professional Forecasters for Q4: 2021-22 is 5.8 per cent. With a normal monsoon and easing of supply conditions with the decline of the Covid infections, the headline CPI inflation for 2022-23 has been projected at 4.5 per cent by the RBI. The quarterly estimates are Q1 at 4.9 per cent; Q2 at 5.0 per cent; Q3 at 4.0 per cent; and Q4 at 4.2 per cent. There are indeed factors that may change this scenario, particularly the impact of geopolitical tensions affecting international commodity prices and trade, and the impact of macroeconomic policies of the advanced economies. To strengthen the positive growth trends in the economy, the need for 30. favourable monetary and financial conditions has remained a critical condition. Pickup in momentum of consumption and investment expenditure would require access to financial resources to both consumers and firms. The inflation rates are projected to moderate and stay below the upper level of the tolerance band of the inflation target at this juncture. With these factors in view, I vote in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. I also vote in favour of continuing with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. To arrive at a voting decision I take up issues of global risks facing the 31. economy, factors determining its expected inflation path and growth recovery, as well as the type and the impact of guidance. 32. Global risks include high oil prices, rising inflation and interest rates in major countries and possible volatility in foreign capital outflows. 33. Indian headline CPI inflation, however, is expected to soften after Q4. Oil prices are high currently but are volatile and unlikely to stay at current levels, lowering WPI, which will also ease as adverse base effects fade. The dominance of food price inflation in second round inflation in India makes CPI inflation affect WPI inflation more than the reverse, although normally it is producer prices that are expected to affect consumer prices1. Therefore, high WPI need not raise CPI. Household inflation expectations have also moderated. 34. Moreover, the food items dominating headline CPI are more amenable to government action. The government is taking active measures to lower domestic commodity inflation, apart from longer term supply-side measures such as reducing logistics and other costs of doing business. Monetary-fiscal coordination on this is excellent. 35. Spillover to CPI from high inflation in advanced economies (AEs) is unlikely since the structure of consumption is very different\u2014imported consumer goods are 12.1% of the Indian consumption basket but 37% for US. Inflation propagation mechanisms such as high wage growth and labour shortages in AEs are not at work here, firms\u2019 pass through of input costs shows moderation yet their profit margins are constant. A combination of cost restructuring and better scale economies may account for this. Container costs have been declining since October. That M3 and credit growth has remained in single digits since the pandemic 36. struck, despite surplus durable liquidity, indicates that aggregate demand is low. In an IT regime the liquidity adjustment facility makes money supply endogenous2, any excess durable liquidity is absorbed in the remunerated reverse repo. Money growth reflects the current state of demand rather than creating demand. 37. Although the third wave of the pandemic seems to have passed with less economic cost, consumption continues at below pre-pandemic levels pointing to loss of income and demand. A future corona variant remains a possibility although we seem to have learnt to handle it better. 38. The budget has reduced deficits only marginally but improved the composition of government spending, which will lower future inflation. Expenditure commitments have been reasonably met, but the proposed rise in capex will take some time to stimulate demand further, even though some construction activities create jobs with little delay. 1 Goyal, A. and S. Tripathi. 2011. \u2018New Keynesian Aggregate Supply in the Tropics: Food prices, wages and inflation\u2019 International Journal of Monetary Economics and Finance. 4(4): 330-354. 2 Indeed, one reason for shifting to the interest rate as an instrument is that money demand becomes unstable, and money supply endogenous, with near money substitutes that financial institutions can create. See Goyal, A. and S. Dash. 2000. \u2018The Money Supply Process in India: Identification, Analysis and Estimation\u2019, Indian Economic Journal, Vol. 48(1), July-September. 39. Export growth is high and is expected to continue despite some softening of world growth, but since imports exceed exports, largely because of commodity imports, net contribution of trade to domestic demand is negative. 40. Another indicator of low demand is high unemployment. Many have lost jobs in the pandemic. Inflation targeting theory tells us that output sacrifice is required to reduce inflation when it is caused by supply shocks and the sacrifice can be very high if supply is elastic as in India. It would not be wise to create even more unemployment in order to reduce inflation, especially when inflation itself is expected to reduce towards the target. Despite continuing uncertainty there are signs of credit growth and investment picking up in some sectors. This needs to be supported in order to sustainably reverse the decade long slowdown in private investment. It follows it is necessary for the MPC to continue to stimulate demand at 41. present. But not as much as earlier, because some recovery has taken place compared to last year. Since one year ahead expected inflation is at 4 per cent and the weighted reverse repo is near 4 per cent, the real policy rate has risen from negative to near zero. 42. Markets, however, have priced in steeply rising policy rates and spreads have risen. This seems to be an over-reaction to the expected rise in Fed rates and of government borrowing requirements. It could also be due to equating Indian inflation incorrectly with US inflation. The Fed has yet to start normalization although inflation has exceeded their target for some time now. But Indian policy started rebalancing excess durable liquidity from early 2021 with the re-introduction of the VRRRs and the reversal of the CRR cut while communicating that ample liquidity will be ensured and conditions remain supportive. Gradual adjustment already undertaken, together with the expected inflation path, implies a sharp rise in Indian policy rates is unlikely to be required. In uncertain times policy is more data driven but the reaction function should be well understood. 43. The interest differential with the US is large. Their real rates remain highly negative. Since interest sensitive foreign flows are still a small percentage of Indian markets, potential outflows are a minuscule portion of India\u2019s large foreign exchange reserves. Sustained equity outflows are unlikely in view of India\u2019s growth potential. Moreover, some outflows will give more space to support government borrowing without raising durable liquidity. In any case room has been created to rebalance any rise or fall in liquidity, as required, with existing instruments in the LAF. 44. The current account deficit remains manageable and the overall balance of payments in surplus with a rising share of foreign direct investment. In 2013 and 2018 following Fed tightening had upset Indian growth and other macros. This time there is space to align policy to the needs of the domestic cycle. In view of expected trends in inflation and growth and in order to moderate 45. market over-reaction, I vote to continue with the current stance and repo rate. 46. As the third Covid-19 wave peters out in India, the time has come to think of the objectives of monetary policy in much broader terms than \u201cmitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy\u201d. Of course, a fourth wave cannot be ruled out, but the third wave has shown that the economy is no longer hostage to the pandemic, and in fact, as we meet, geopolitical tensions have become a bigger risk to the global economy than the virus. 47. Monetary policy acts with lags, and it is important to set policy looking at the expected state of the economy 3-4 quarters from now and not in terms of where it is today. The RBI projections presented in the fan charts (Chart 2) show growth running out of steam after an initial burst of decent growth in the first couple of quarters. In other words, the pre-pandemic situation of an economy growing below potential is expected to re-assert itself. According to Chart 1, inflation is expected to drop close to the 4% target towards the end of 2022-23. Going by these projections, it appears to me that while real interest rates need to be remain low, they do need to become mildly positive during 2022-23. The projections also suggest that though a significant part of the normalization of real interest rates would happen through the expected decline in inflation, there would be a need for a modest rise in nominal interest rates. The fan charts also reveal a very large range of uncertainty on both inflation 48. and growth. Robust growth coupled with sticky inflation could necessitate larger rises in nominal rates, while weak growth accompanied by benign inflation could open up the space for a more accommodative monetary policy. With risks appearing to be balanced on both sides, the policy stance needs to be neutral. 49. I find it instructive to compare the situation today (February 2022) with that at the last pre-pandemic MPC meeting (February 2020) in terms of projections three quarters ahead (Q3 of 2022-23 and Q3 of 2020-21 respectively). Compared to then, (i) three-quarter ahead growth expectations are about 2% lower, (ii) three-quarter ahead inflation expectations are about 1% higher, and (iii) the real policy rate (based on three-quarter ahead inflation expectations) is now about 2% lower. This comparison also suggests a neutral policy stance. 50. Taking all this into account, I vote in favour of maintaining the policy rate at 4% while voting against the policy stance on two counts. First, a switch to neutral stance is now long overdue. Second, the continued harping on combating the ill effect of the pandemic has become counter productive and deflects the focus of the MPC away from the core issue of addressing the recessionary trends that go back at least to 2019. 51. I have in the past expressed my reservations about the abnormal width of the policy corridor, but with all money market rates having moved close to the upper end of the corridor, the persistence with a low reverse repo rate has now become a somewhat harmless fetishism, and I will therefore not dwell on it. 52. The contours of shifting macroeconomic conditions, visible since October 2021, have got elevated further since we last met in early December. Let me dwell into these shifts and their implications. 53. First, the global interest rate cycle is decidedly changing. The benchmark 10- year JGB yield is at its highest since 2015, while the 10-year German bunds yields have moved into positive terrain in February crossing early 2019 levels with spreads widening in the euro area periphery. The US treasury yields have surged above pre- pandemic levels. On current indications, the Fed is on path to complete taper and start lift off by March and quantitative tightening a few months later. Markets have moved to expecting five rate hikes by the Fed, two by ECB and three more by BoE this year in addition to the two already effected over last two months. CPI inflation for December 2021 in the US came at 7% (highest since June 1982) and the PCE inflation at 5.8% (highest since July 1982). Headline inflation for the euro area as per flash estimates for January 2022 was ruling at 5.1% (highest since 1997 when index recording began) and in UK at 5.4% in December 2021 (highest since March 1992). With inflation in these geographies witnessing wide gaps over their 2% inflation targets, their central banks have little choice but to raise rates sooner than later. The situation in India is not similar. While CPI inflation at 5.6% in December 2021 is higher than the target, it is still within the tolerance band and is projected to recede in 2022-23 allowing monetary authorities to remain accommodative. However, the changing global monetary policy cycle implies that emerging market economies like ours will do well to brace for tighter financial conditions ahead even if domestic monetary policy stays accommodative. 54. Moreover, as interest differential narrows and current account widens, macroeconomic dynamics will come into play. How should our monetary policy react to this; and will inflation targeting hamper exchange rate management in these conditions? Low for long interest rates will certainly bring in macroeconomic imbalances and it is expedient that policy rate should be raised as soon as growth is judged to recover on a durable basis or inflation is seen to be turning endemic. In the interim, the good part is that we have built buffers against possible capital outflows. There is evidence to suggest that in small open economies that face imperfect substitution between domestic and foreign financial assets, the exchange rate management greatly enhances the efficacy of inflation targeting. These economies are able to avoid macroeconomic fluctuations which can be driven by self-fulfilling expectations. Sterilised interventions can be a key strategy should the need arise. 55. Typically, in case of sudden stops, rise in global interest rates prompts corporate sector to deleverage. Indian corporates have already deleveraged significantly and also reduced stock of external commercial borrowings in US dollar terms, which at end-September 2021 was 7.3% lower than at end of 2019. The \u2018original sin\u2019, a situation in which a country cannot borrow abroad in their own currency has been the bug bear for emerging markets during upturn cycles in global interest rates. However, the original sin has somewhat weakened in recent years with the development of local currency bond markets. With high foreign reserves, exchange rates may turn less sensitive to global factors such as the US VIX. India having moved to inflation targeting regime should benefit from lower local currency spreads as well as lower exchange rate risk premia. However, it will be important to maintain credibility by aiming to maintain inflation on a sustained basis at or near the target as soon as real economy conditions normalise. 56. Second, Omicron variant, along with continued port congestions and supply shortages has started to drag down global growth. This, in turn, may act in accordance with Bernoulli\u2019s principle on fluid pressure, making the growth pipe narrower with falling external demand acting to dampen price pressures that have turned elevated from the supply-side. Omicron wave has pushed the broad-based recovery further down the time, even though the disruptions caused by this third wave have been smaller compared to the first and even the second wave. Three points are noteworthy: (i) in India, the 7-day Moving Average of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases during this wave has dropped 60% from its peak on January 25 but is still 14 times the number when the first Omicron case was detected in India; (ii) though the mortality incidence in India is currently about a fourth of the peak seen during the second wave, the daily new deaths have risen three times since the onset of the Omicron wave and currently matches the peak deaths seen during the elongated first wave and so, hard statistics do not yet afford the comfort that we can overlook the pandemic and focus beyond; (iii) vaccinations have certainly contributed to mitigating the severity of disease outcomes. However, with continuous mutations, there is lack of clarity on enduring vaccine efficacy. 57. Third, uncertainties about energy prices have risen considerably. Indian crude oil basket is up nearly 25% in the previous two months. The current geopolitical stress in Europe is a significant risk and if it translates into oil and gas prices spiking, we will need to adjust macro-economic policies suitably. Fourth, it is a no-brainer that the fiscal impulse needs to be factored in our 58. monetary policy calculations. The pace of fiscal consolidation this year has been balanced by consideration to preserve Keynesian stimulus and to continue spending support for those disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The size of the gross market borrowing at \u20b914.3 lakh crore is large. Therefore, monetary-fiscal coordination remains important to avoid inferior outcomes. In this backdrop, smooth rebalancing of liquidity assumes critical importance for inflation management. This, however, does not mean that monetary policy should no longer support 59. growth. While the capex push in the latest budget will support growth, monetary policy still has a complementary role to play. Uncertainty remains on account of whether States and PSUs will keep capex high this year and whether execution will remain on track. 60. Let me now briefly sum up how growth and inflation scenarios might unfold and my view on the decisions at hand. High frequency indicators, after impressive sequential improvements during June-October 2021 lost momentum in November but bounced back in December. Early information on select high frequency indictors now available for January 2022 exhibit renewed loss of momentum in January on account of Omicron spread. Electricity demand met has decelerated to a 2.1% m-o-m increase in January 2022 from 9.9% in December 2021. Vehicle registrations, E-way bills and toll collection volumes contracted m-o-m by 7.9%, 3.9% and 4.6%, respectively in January 2022. Overall, automobile sales, crude oil production, railway and air passenger traffic are yet below the 2019-20 levels. While the unemployment rate fell in January 2022 to 6.6% from 7.9% in December, it was mostly due to a marked sequential fall in Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) by 1-percentage point to 39.9%. Employment rate worsened in January 2022 to 37.2% and was the lowest since August 2021 and LFPR was the lowest in last seven months. 61. On inflation, the headline inflation is projected to ease to the vicinity of 5.0% mark in H1:2022-23 and then recede further to the target of 4.0% by Q3:2020-23. However, monsoon outturn and oil price dynamics will need to be closely watched. While for decision at hand, both the baseline and the risks are important, the incremental data since the December meeting affords some comfort as it suggests that the fears that price increases may get generalised are not materialising. At the item-level, while 80% of the items registered a sequential increase in October 2021, the number dropped to 73% in November and further to only 66% in the latest reading for the month of December, which is in line with the pre-pandemic average for the inflation targeting period. Similar trend of a lower diffusion is also seen in the case of WPI, with the index falling in December for the first time in 19-months. 62. Considering the above, I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged and retaining the accommodative stance, while emphasising the need to maintain appropriate financial conditions with evolving situation. 63. The global outlook is sombre. Consumption spending is dented by the Omicron-driven wave of the pandemic. Labour and production disruptions continue. Consensus forecasts suggest that a global deceleration has commenced in the first quarter of 2022. Multilateral 2 percentage points of speed during 2022 and 2023. In other words, a prolonged slowdown looms and there are risks that it could tip over into a recession. institutions project global growth losing up 64. Inflation may take longer to slow \u2013 perhaps the greater part of 2022 \u2013 but slow it will. Already there are indications that supply chain pressures are peaking and getting set to ease. In corroboration, the UNCTAD nowcasts merchandise trade volume to have picked up pace in the last quarter of 2021 from the quarter before. This cannot happen without port decongestion and supply chain pressures easing. 65. In my view, the pandemic inflation surge is not being driven by excess demand but by supply constraints. It is turning out to be harder to bring supply capacities on stream than for demand to restart, partly due to the fact that supply capacities are in the wrong places. For instance, the pandemic caused a shift in consumer spending away from services and towards goods. The result is supply bottlenecks in goods producing sectors and spare capacities in services. Consequently, inflation is driven ever higher even though economic activity is yet to fully recover to its potential. 66. Monetary policy is an instrument of stabilisation. Its role is to align demand with supply, not the other way round. When inflation is driven by demand, monetary policy can stabilise inflation and growth. Monetary policy cannot play its stabilization role when inflation is the result of supply constraints. So central banks have a choice: either accept higher inflation for some time or be prepared to be accountable for destroying demand. The reality, however, is that in terms of the policy responses, the biggest 67. economies in the world are pulling in opposite directions. Monetary policy authorities in several parts of the world look at inflation in the rear-view mirror in which objects can look bigger than they are and they prepare to normalise and tighten. If they looked forward, they would sight a falling trajectory of inflation. Other countries have to brace up for shock waves from spillovers. Geo-political tensions and climate transition challenges complicate the outlook. Overall, I regard monetary policy chasing inflation instead of anticipating it as the main factor weighing down on global growth prospects. 68. The Indian economy is encountering headwinds as well as cross currents. First the headwinds: (1) even though we allow ourselves cautious optimism about the recent decline in infections, it is important to keep in mind that India has the second highest caseload of Covid-19 in the world and it is important to be cognisant of the scarring; (2) a mutation of Omicron - Ba2 - is showing up around the world and spreading fast - India has already reported cases of this sub-variant; and (3) more than a billion vaccinations have been achieved but only 56 per cent of the total population is fully vaccinated; the next billion will be back breaking. Turning to cross currents, mobility of people has exhibited a sequential 69. moderation in January, but movement of goods remains robust as evident in freight volumes, toll collections and GST revenues. Aggregate demand conditions are facing similar conflicted pulls. Power and fuel consumption is rising, but there is a broad- based decline in vehicle registrations, primarily due to shortage of semiconductors amidst global supply chain disruptions. Consumer confidence has improved, sales of fast moving consumer goods has been inching up and in the top 7 cities, housing sales jumped in 2021. On the hand, labour participation is falling. All in all, very divergent pulls. 70. There are several positives too which have withstood the pandemic\u2019s waves. First, India\u2019s merchandise exports are on course to reach an ambitious target for 2021-22. Second, services exports are also doing well. These developments should work towards keeping the current account deficit within sustainable limits. Third, foreign direct investment into India has held up well, moderating slightly from last year\u2019s level. Fourth, India\u2019s total external debt is more than covered by the stock of international reserves. In fact, India\u2019s international assets cover three-fourth of all international liabilities. Thus, the external sector, which will bear the brunt of shocks from abroad, remains robust and resilient enough to withstand the tidal waves of global spillovers. Fifth, the agriculture outlook is bright, with both foodgrains and horticulture heading towards new records. The projections indicate that headline CPI inflation (year-on-year) may test the 71. upper tolerance band in January 2022. There will be public consternation on February 14 when the CPI for January will be released, but what may escape public notice is that this will essentially be because of an unfavourable base effect which may camouflage a welcome decline in the momentum of key food prices that has set in since October 2021. There has also been some let-up in input cost pressures. 72. To sum up, economic activity in India appears to have resiliently withstood the third wave, but messages from incoming high frequency indicators are mixed. It is prudent to assume that the recovery may have lost some momentum during Q4: 2021-22 and Q1: 2022-23. Inflation appears to be approaching an inflection point after which it is projected on a downward path through all of 2022-23. Accordingly, I vote for maintaining the policy rate and the accommodative stance of policy unchanged. Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 73. This MPC meeting takes place in the backdrop of global headwinds turning more adverse. Perceptible slowdown in growth together with elevated inflation in several countries characterise the global economy at present. The trajectories of growth and inflation, however, continue to diverge between countries. This has impelled some central banks to embark on aggressive policy tightening to quell inflation risks, while a few others, mostly emerging market economies (EMEs), continue to maintain accommodative policies. The adverse spillovers from such divergent policy responses could materialise quickly on the global and domestic outlook. Policy making is getting increasingly complex in this environment. 74. In the domestic front, rapid spread of the Omicron variant in conjunction with the fading of festive and pent-up demand has tempered economic activity in the near- term as reflected in several high-frequency indicators. Going forward, the current wave is showing signs of waning and with the return of normalcy, the pace of economic activity is likely to be bolstered by buoyant Rabi prospects, robust export demand, accommodative monetary and liquidity conditions, improving credit offtake, and the continued push in capital expenditure and infrastructure in the Union Budget 2022-23. On the downside, slowing global growth could impact exports while demand for contact intensive services would remain contingent on the trajectory of COVID-19 infections. High commodity prices and supply side shortages could weigh on corporate profitability amid weak pricing power and unfavourable base effects during 2022-23. The global financial market volatility associated with monetary policy normalisation process in the advanced economies could further complicate the situation. 75. As regards inflation, there has been considerable improvement in the outlook for food prices since the last bi-monthly review. Vegetable prices, after the spike of October-November, have seen significant seasonal correction which is likely to continue on fresh winter crop arrivals. In addition, the December CPI print saw price corrections in edible oils and pulses coming from the supply side interventions by the Government. The record Rabi acreage, propelled by a significantly higher acreage of oilseeds and pulses, along with prospects of higher yields for wheat, augur well for a bumper harvest of key food items. Further, considering the advance estimates of a robust kharif harvest, and on the assumption of a normal monsoon, there is room for considerable optimism on the food inflation trajectory over the next financial year. 76. The renewed surge in international crude oil prices, however, requires close monitoring. We need to remain watchful of the risks to domestic inflation arising from rise in international commodity prices due to exogenous factors including geo-political developments. While core inflation remains elevated, demand-pull pressures are still muted, given the slack in the economy. On balance, inflation is likely to peak in Q4: 2021-22 and thereafter soften to around 5.0 per cent in H1:2022-23 and further closer to the target in H2:2022-23 with an average inflation rate of 4.5 per cent for the entire financial year. 77. Amidst growing divergence in policy responses on the global front, our monetary policy should remain attuned to the evolving domestic inflation and growth dynamics. Despite recovery in 2021-22, real GDP is only marginally higher than the pre-pandemic level with private consumption still trailing its 2019-20 level. Inflation pressures in India continue to emanate largely from supply side factors, and the recent print also reflects adverse base effects. The expected moderation in inflation trajectory over the next financial year provides room for monetary policy to remain accommodative. At the same time, economic recovery from the pandemic remains incomplete and uneven and continued support from various policies remains crucial for a sustained recovery. In this period of prolonged uncertainty, it would be wise to remain agile and 78. respond in a gradual, calibrated and well telegraphed manner to the emerging challenges. Taking into consideration the outlook for inflation and growth, in particular the comfort provided by the improving inflation outlook, the uncertainties related to Omicron and global spillovers, I vote for status quo in the repo rate. I also vote to continue with our forward guidance of accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.

Marg, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 The thirty fourth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from April 6 to 8, 2022. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 industrial, services and the outlook performance, credit conditions, infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (April 8, 2022) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. The marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate remain unchanged at 4.25 per cent. The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate, which will now be the floor of the LAF corridor, will be at 3.75 per cent.  The MPC also decided to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Since the MPC\u2019s meeting in February 2022, the global economic and financial 6. environment has worsened with the escalation of geopolitical conflict and accompanying sanctions. Commodity prices have shot up substantially across the board amidst heightened volatility, with adverse fallouts on net commodity importers. Financial markets have exhibited increased volatility. Crude oil prices jumped to 14- year high in early March; despite some correction, they remain volatile at elevated levels. Supply chain pressures, which were set to ease, are rising again. The broad- based jump in global commodity prices has exacerbated inflationary pressures across advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) alike causing a sharp revision in their inflation projections. The global composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) eased to 52.7 in March from 53.5 in February with in both manufacturing and services sectors. World output growth slowing merchandise trade momentum has weakened. 7. Several central banks, especially systemic ones, continue to be on the path of normalisation and tightening of monetary policy stances. Resultantly, sovereign bond yields in major AEs have been hardening. Bullion prices had buoyed to near 2020 highs on safe haven flows, with some recent correction as bond yields rose. Global equity markets fell, although more recently they have recovered some ground. In recent weeks, strong capital outflows from the EMEs have moderated thus curbing the downward pressures on their currencies, even as the US dollar has strengthened. Overall, the global economy faces major headwinds from several fronts, including continuing uncertainty about the pandemic\u2019s trajectory. Domestic Economy 8. The second advance estimates (SAE) for 2021-22 released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on February 28, 2022 placed India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 8.9 per cent, 1.8 per cent above the pre-pandemic (2019- 20) level. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) rose by 8.3 per cent in 2021-22, with its major components, including services, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. GDP growth in Q3:2021-22 decelerated to 5.4 per cent. 9. In Q4:2021-22, available high frequency indicators exhibit signs of recovery with the fast ebbing of the third wave but the picture is mixed. Urban demand reflected in domestic air traffic rebounded in March and the pace of contraction in passenger vehicle sales moderated in February. On the other hand, rural demand mirrored in two-wheeler and tractor sales contracted in February. Import of capital goods increased robustly in February, although domestic production continued to contract. Merchandise exports remained buoyant and clocked double-digit growth for the thirteenth successive month in March 2022 and reached US$ 417.8 billion in 2021-22 surpassing the target of US$ 400 billion. All categories of imports, however, have risen even faster, leading to merchandise trade deficit at a record annual level of US $ 192 billion in 2021-22 or 6.1 per cent of GDP. 10. On the supply side, foodgrains production touched a new record in 2021-22, with both kharif and rabi output crossing the final estimates for 2020-21 as well as the targets set for 2021-22. The manufacturing PMI remained in expansion zone in March, although it moderated somewhat to 54.0 from 54.9 in February. Services sector indicators \u2013 railway freight; e-way bills; GST collections; toll collections; fuel consumption; and electricity demand \u2013 were in expansion in February-March. The services PMI continued in expansion mode, inching up to 53.6 in March from 51.8 in the preceding month. 11. Headline CPI inflation edged up to 6.0 per cent in January 2022 and 6.1 per cent in February, breaching the upper tolerance threshold. Pick-up in food inflation contributed the most in headline inflation, with inflation of cereals, vegetables, spices and protein-based food items like eggs, meat and fish being the key drivers. Fuel inflation moderated on continuing deflation in electricity and steady LPG prices. Core inflation, i.e., CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated, though there was some moderation from 6.0 per cent in January to 5.8 per cent in February primarily due to the easing of inflation in transport and communication; pan, tobacco and intoxicants; recreation and amusement; and health. 12. Overall system liquidity remained in large surplus, with average daily absorption (through both the fixed and variable rate reverse repos) under the LAF at \u20b97.5 lakh crore in March, marginally lower than \u20b97.8 lakh crore in January-February 2022. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 10.9 per cent (y-o-y) on April 1, 2022. Money supply (M3) and bank credit by commercial banks rose (y-o-y) by 8.7 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively, as on March 25, 2022. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 30.3 billion to US$ 607.3 billion in 2021-22. Outlook 13. Looking ahead, the inflation trajectory will depend critically upon the evolving geopolitical situation and its impact on global commodity prices and logistics. On food prices, domestic prices of cereals have registered increases in sympathy with international prices, though record foodgrains production and buffer stock levels should prevent a major flare up in domestic prices. Elevated global price pressures in key food items such as edible oils, and in animal and poultry feed due to global supply shortages impart high uncertainty to the food price outlook, warranting continuous monitoring. 14. In this scenario, pro-active supply management is critical to contain inflation. International crude oil prices remain volatile and elevated, with considerable uncertainties surrounding global supplies. With the broad-based surge in prices of key industrial inputs and global supply chain disruptions, input cost push pressures appear likely to persist for longer than expected earlier. Their pass-through to retail prices, though limited till now given the continuing slack in the economy, needs to be monitored carefully. Manufacturing sector firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expect higher input and output price pressures going forward. Taking into account these factors and on the assumption of a normal monsoon in 2022 and average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 100 per barrel, inflation is now projected at 5.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q1 at 6.3 per cent; Q2 at 5.8 per cent; Q3 at 5.4 per cent; and Q4 at 5.1 per cent (Chart 1). 15. Going forward, good prospects of rabi output augur well for rural demand. With the ebbing of the third wave and expanding vaccination coverage, the pick-up in contact-intensive services and urban demand is expected to be sustained. The government\u2019s thrust on capital expenditure coupled with initiatives such as the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme should bolster private investment activity, amidst improving capacity utilisation, deleveraged corporate balance sheets, higher offtake of bank credit and congenial financial conditions. At the same time, the escalation of the geopolitical situation and the accompanying surge in international crude oil and other commodity prices, tightening of global financial conditions, persistence of supply-side disruptions and significantly weaker external demand pose downside risks to the outlook. The future course of the pandemic and the uncertainties about the pace of monetary policy normalisation in major advanced economies also weigh on the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, the real GDP growth for 2022-23 is now projected at 7.2 per cent, with Q1 at 16.2 per cent; Q2 at 6.2 per cent; Q3 at 4.1 per cent; and Q4 at 4.0 per cent, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 2). 16. The MPC is of the view that since the February meeting, the ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions, generalised hardening of global commodity prices, the likelihood of prolonged supply chain disruptions, dislocations in trade and capital flows, divergent monetary policy responses and volatility in global financial markets are imparting sizeable upside risks to the inflation trajectory and downside risks to domestic growth. 17. Given the evolving risks and uncertainties, the MPC has decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 18. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate at 4.0 per cent. 19.

Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent 22. At the beginning of February 2022, a number of indicators reflected an environment of sustained overall growth for the economy. The economic impact of the rise in Omicron variant of the coronavirus appeared limited. However, there were also concerns relating to the global economic outlook with the rise in Covid cases, supply chain disruptions and rising inflation pressures. For India, with a strong growth in agricultural output in FY 2021-22, going forward, adequate policy support for investment and consumer spending was expected to strengthen the growth momentum. The scenario, however, has been reshaped by the Russia-Ukraine war, the economic fallout of which has affected the overall global growth and price conditions sharply. 23. The prolonged duration and scale of destruction in the conflict and the wide ranging economic sanctions by the Western countries on Russia that followed the beginning of the conflict have had global implications. The supply chain disruptions aggravated an already stressed global supply system on account of the Covid pandemic and led prices of a number of commodities in the international markets to rise sharply and turn volatile. Energy prices and prices of some of the food commodities in particular have increased sharply compared to February. Crude oil prices rose by about 30 per cent in the international markets in February-March 2022. Prices of edible oils and wheat also increased sharply during the period. 24. Even before the Russia-Ukraine war, the monetary policy response to the rising inflationary pressures in the advanced countries had begun with the increase in policy rates and measures to tighten the easy liquidity conditions created to manage the adverse impact of the Covid pandemic. The monetary policy tightening in the advanced countries is expected to continue in order to bring down the inflation rates, but it would also have a significant impact on trade and investment flows for the developing world. 25. Given the three successive large negative shocks to growth and employment during the Covid pandemic conditions, the MPC has chosen to maintain conditions favourable to revival of growth on a sustained basis while maintaining inflation rate within the tolerance limits of the target. The sustained recovery seen in the growth conditions in Q3:2021-22 was nevertheless incomplete. On the positive side, there were indications of moderating pattern of inflation rate in 2022-23 on the basis of the ongoing recovery, assumption of a normal monsoon and moderation on international commodity price pressures. The sharp changes in the broader global economic environment that have now unfolded require a reconsideration of the economic outlook and the policy responses. 26. As the shocks to the price conditions are essentially on the supply side, emanating from external sector, unless the potential of the reviving domestic demand conditions to sustain higher prices is reduced, inflation pressures would rise further. While finding alternative international supply sources for imports and markets for exports is necessary, domestic inflationary pressures will not be relieved effectively unless the external supply constraints in the form of restrictions on movement of goods and finances are removed. Global coordination in easing these constraints would have major benefits in minimising the adverse effects of supply disruptions. Limiting the spill over from the rising energy and food prices in the international markets to the domestic markets would also reduce pressures on the external and fiscal imbalances. 27. The Second Advance Estimates of GDP released by the National Statistics Organisation at the end of February 2022 reflect the substantial gap in output growth needed to restore the high growth momentum after the setbacks in the last two years. While the YOY basis real GDP growth of 8.9 per cent in FY 2022 represents a rebound from its contraction by 6.6 per cent in FY 2021, the incomplete nature of the growth recovery is reflected in the growth rates of its components, especially when compared to the pre-pandemic scenario. In comparison to FY 2020, real GDP increased marginally by 1.8 per cent, the private final consumption expenditure increased by 1.2 per cent, gross fixed capital formation by 2.6 per cent. Exports and imports increased by 9.9 and 11.9 per cent in FY 2022 over FY 2020. In terms of value added, the divergence in performance is reflected in the growth rates of 0.4 per cent in the case of Services and 9.8 per cent in manufacturing. Real GDP in Q3:FY 2022 increased by 5.4 per cent over the same period in the previous year. 28. The available data on a wide range of indicators of output and demand conditions for January and February point to an on-going recovery. Year on year growth in GST collection has maintained its strong growth and Non-food Bank Credit has maintained its higher pace of YOY growth since December 2021. Exports for the year have exceeded the record target for $400 billion set by the government. RBI\u2019s survey of Order Books, Inventories and Capacity utilisation in companies conducted the in January-March 2022, reveals manufacturing sector in Q3:2021-22, moving closer to its long-term average. PMI for manufacturing in March 2022 shows a drop by 0.9 point from February, while PMI for services increased by 1.8 points, both remaining in expansion zone. RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys [Industry Outlook (IOS) and Services and Infrastructure Outlook (SIOS)] conducted during January-March 2022 indicate that the firms are less optimistic about overall business conditions. This may reflect the conditions relating to the abating impact of the Omicron variant on the positive and the apprehensions about the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war on the negative side of the business environment. The consumption expenditure indicators show a mixed picture. RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey conducted in the early part of March 2022 indicates that as compared to the findings of the same survey in January 2022, a significantly larger proportion of respondents report higher spending than a year back but this increase is mostly driven by \u2018essential spending\u2019. The proportion of respondents reporting reduction in \u2018non-essential spending\u2019 has, however, declined. The IIP for in consumer durables and non-durables in January 2022 is below the level seen in 2019-20 in the same period. 29. What has changed clearly for the consumers and producers in March 2022 is the price rise for fuels and some food items in what appears to be a first round impact with the full pass through of the rise in the international prices yet to be complete. The input cost pressures are reported in the RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys, particularly in the services and infrastructure. The uncertainty on the evolution of both growth and inflation in next 3-4 30. quarters has increased considerably. The prolonged war and its fall out may have accentuated the adverse impact of monetary policy tightening that has begun in several countries, especially on the growth front. The Covid related growth disruptions in China also have adverse impact on global demand. 31. The upturn of CPI inflation rate in February 2022 at 6.1 per cent is the second successive monthly reading at or above 6 per cent. Among the major sub-categories of the headline inflation, \u2018fuel & light\u2019 and \u2018miscellaneous\u2019 registered rates of increase above 6 per cent in both these months, with the fuel & light at 9.0 per cent and Miscellaneous at 6.5 per cent, YOY average for January-February 2022. Although \u2018Food & beverages category\u2019 registered an increase of 5.8 per cent, Oils & Fats registered an increase of 17.6 per cent and within Miscellaneous, CPI inflation for Household Goods & Services, Health, Transport & Communications, Recreation & Amusement sub-categories exceeded 6 per cent for the two-month period. The global supply chain disruptions since late-February as a result of Russia-Ukraine war and their impact on energy and food commodity prices on domestic prices have now added to more generalised cost push pressures. 32. Consequent to the above changes in growth and inflation scenarios, the projected GDP and CPI inflation rates for FY 2023 are as follows: GDP growth rates (YOY%) - Q1: 16.2, Q2: 6.2, Q3: 4.1 and Q4: 4.0 with the financial year projection at 7.2 per cent. CPI inflation rates (YOY%): Q1: 6.3, Q2: 5.8, Q3: 5.4 and Q4: 5.1 with the financial year average of 5.7 per cent. The revised projections reflect the impact of both supply disruptions and moderating demand conditions leading to lower GDP growth and higher inflation rate. RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) carried out during March 2022 provide a median GDP growth forecast of 7.5 per cent and inflation forecast of 5.5 per cent for FY 2023. The SPF assessment has also shown downward revision in GDP growth and upward revision in inflation forecasts for FY 2023. The present situation reflects improving conditions with respect to managing 33. the Covid threat, with the scaled-up vaccinations and an understanding of measures to control any further outbreak of infections. However, improved demand conditions in the face of fresh global supply constraints may lead to increased inflation affecting the growth recovery itself. Response to the evolving price conditions and broad- based policy measures to effectively bring down inflationary pressures without disrupting the favourable environment for sustaining growth are now needed. Accordingly, I vote to keep the policy repo rate at 4.0 per cent. 35. I also vote to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. The Ukraine war has lasted more than a month, uncertainties continue, oil 36. prices are volatile, supply disruptions will raise inflation but also reduce demand; the continued high impact of Covid-19 in major countries will have similar effects. 37. consumption. Moreover, falling wage share will also decrease their demand. The typical household response to inflationary supply shocks is to decrease 38. Although household inflation expectations remain high, they have risen only marginally in the last two months, despite the rise in international oil prices\u2014this points to the salience of domestic oil prices, of government action that affects these prices and of RBI guidance for households. Expectations fell when the government cut fuel excise in November 2021. The absence of any rise in dispersion points to some anchoring. One-year-ahead business inflation expectations, however, recently crossed 6%. 39. Capacity utilisation, especially in some sectors and for large firms has reached pre-Covid-19 levels; unemployment shows signs of falling. The non-oil non-gold current account is also in deficit, although the rising share of financial savings should reduce the need for foreign savings. Credit growth is higher and the PMI continues to be in the expansionary zone. But Q3 shows some softening\u2014the recovery is still not strong. Firms facing low demand have limited their pass through yet profit margins have remained largely constant due to falling wage share and interest costs\u2014firms still have scope to absorb rise in costs. Second round effects have yet to set in. Cost- push is still coming from primary but multiple supply shocks. 40. Covid-19 is waning in India. Current trends suggest there is more physical as well as economic immunity. Signals are mixed, yet clearly crisis level of stimulus is no longer required. 41. As pressures on oil prices persist, pump prices began rising steeply in end March. RBI consumer headline inflation estimate for the year is raised to 5.7 per cent, which implies the real rate has fallen further and is now too negative. 42. With some recovery and high commodity prices it will not be necessary to cut repo rates further. Future policy will either pause or raise rates. Rebalancing of liquidity started in 2021, and has now reached a level, with new facilities to absorb liquidity, that is compatible with raising policy rates. Short rates are set to rise to make the repo rate the operational policy rate again. 43. Research as well as Indian experience in the 2000s shows an early and gradual rise works better. Rebalancing of liquidity began early. It is time now to withdraw crisis time accommodation in terms of moving towards the equilibrium or neutral real rates consistent with non-inflationary growth. As long as rates remain below this, it is still not a tightening regime. When rates are below neutral because of excess crisis related accommodation, the initial rise only takes them towards neutral. 44. Exit should be balanced avoiding the over-stimulus after the global financial crisis and the consequent over-tightening in the 2010s. A rate rise that responds to excess demand, as well as to persistent inflation, so that the real rate adjusts smoothly and does not deviate too far from equilibrium will best be able to anchor inflation expectations yet sustain the growth recovery while minimising market volatility and output sacrifice. 45. Supply-side action has a major role in anchoring inflation expectations in order to sustain consumer confidence and the recovery. In April 2019 domestic petrol prices exceeded international prices by \u20b940 per litre. The gap widened in the Covid- 19 years as international prices fell but domestic taxes were not reduced. These were an essential revenue-source then as other sources had collapsed with activity. In February 2022 the gap was back to \u20b940 as international prices had risen. The difference now is that direct and indirect taxes are buoyant, 30 to 40% higher than their levels in 2019. There is room to cut fuel taxes to mitigate the pass through of international prices to consumers. Excise duty could go back to 2019 levels that were high enough to limit oil consumption, even as other efforts to substitute towards renewable sources continue. The extent of nominal rate and borrowing cost rise required will depend on 46. supply-side action. Even under rising rates, fiscal stress will reduce over time as long as real rates are kept smoothly below growth rates helping lower deficit and debt ratios over time. Outflows under US Fed tightening give more room for supporting government borrowing consistent with the required growth in reserve money. Such support is the most effective in moderating rise in long-term nominal rates in Indian conditions1. There is room for spreads to fall since the historical spread between the repo and the 10-year G-sec was only 60 basis points. 47. Excess inflows are accumulated as reserves. Therefore, excess outflows or a temporary balance of payments deficit requires some of these reserves to be used to moderate excess rupee volatility. Limiting rupee depreciation will also reduce inflation and the oil bill. When inflation expectations are well-anchored terms of trade shocks can be looked through but it is better to avoid adding such shocks at a time of other multiple supply shocks. The real exchange rate is at competitive levels since exports are doing well. Moreover, Indian structural reform has reduced the cost of doing business and this time Indian inflation is less than international. 48. Both fiscal and monetary policy must use the space available to smooth international shocks, while taking unavoidable hits. In the last decade emerging markets as a group grew more slowly because such shocks had persistent effects. Costs of adjusting to the global financial crisis were passed on to them. Countries that have reformed suitably and built buffers may be able to protect themselves better this time. 49. In view of these considerations I vote to keep the repo rate unchanged and to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Exit of accommodation is proceeding but its pace awaits future developments. 50. The geopolitical situation has worsened considerably since the February meeting, and consequently inflation projections have risen sharply. However, I would like to point out that the hostilities in Europe have imparted an adverse shock not only to inflation, but also to growth. While the inflation shock is more clearly and immediately visible, the growth shock cannot be ignored. There is at least anecdotal evidence that businesses are becoming reluctant to pass on input cost increases to the customers because of concerns about demand compression. 51. I refrain from discussing whether, on balance, the changed situation warrants immediate action on the policy rate for the simple reason that the forward guidance given in the last meeting effectively precludes such action. It is important to maintain 1 See Goyal, A. 2019. \u2018Government Securities Market: Price Discovery, Monetary Management and Government Borrowing\u2019, Economic and Political Weekly, 54(13): 44-58. 30 March.

In this backdrop, maintaining the policy rate at the current level is the only sensible choice, and I therefore vote to keep the policy repo rate at 4.0 per cent. 52. months now, and I welcome this action which forms part of the MPC statement. I have been arguing for the normalization of the policy corridor for several 53. Coming to the \u201cstance\u201d, I think it is wholly appropriate that this word has been dropped from the resolution. In the extremely uncertain situation that prevails today, it is very important for the MPC not to issue any forward guidance that would tie its hands. It is necessary to communicate clearly that in future meetings, the MPC would consider itself completely free to take any action on the policy rates that may be warranted by the data that becomes available in the coming weeks. With inflation projected to breach the upper tolerance limit for several months, it is imperative for the MPC to communicate its resolve to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward. It is also necessary to prepare the markets for the withdrawal of the post pandemic monetary accommodation. I therefore vote to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Statement by Dr. Mridul K. Saggar 54. The world is changing in many important ways. The anticipated global and domestic macroeconomic trajectories that were shaping will get reset in slope and intercept. In my statement in February, I had stated that \u201cthe current geopolitical stress in Europe is a significant risk and if it translates into oil and gas prices spiking, we will need to adjust macro-economic policies suitably\u201d. The contingent risk has materialised calling for policy shifts. We are witnessing an entrenched conflict. While it remains unclear how long it may last, it looks that even on its de-escalation, the supply chain disruption and elevated prices of energy, agro-products and minerals and metals may last for at least a year. With some ratchet, it will leave permanent effects on price levels, making it necessary for the monetary policy to deal with its second-round effects so that inflation is not elevated as a multi-year phenomenon. The War will also have significant detrimental effects on growth. In my statement in December last, I had cautioned on the building global stagflationary impulses. The Ukraine shock will further slow the global recovery, risks of a global recession are still small and predicated on war spreading over to the rest of the continent or beyond, thus remaining a tail risk event. 55. To add to the shock, the Fed kept tryst with the lift off in mid-March and indicated a quantitative tightening (balance sheet reduction) starting May. The baseline looks like the Fed will consciously entail a significant growth sacrifice and go ahead with aggressive rate hikes in the rest of the year in a bid to tame high inflation. However, global inflation is here to stay for the rest of the year at least. Against their 2% inflation targets, CPI inflation in the U.S., euro area and UK inflation are set to cross 8% in near term, which is four times their targets. Notwithstanding the difficulties in measuring potential output amid extreme shocks, wide array of measures suggests that the output gaps in the U.S. and the U.K. economies have not just closed but turned positive, though due to shallow cyclical recovery and the war retrenchment the same cannot be said of the euro area. So, the advanced economies face a big inflation gap and a closed output gap, thus justifying aggressive tightening based on the central bank reaction functions. Even in many emerging markets, inflation is ruling at multi-year highs. In contrast, inflation in India is not yet in inertial motion. Nevertheless, considering that we face elevated inflation that is projected, on an average, to be 1.7 percentage point above target and a likely closed output gap in my assessment later this year, it is important to take measured policy actions. Let me now cover the growth and inflation assessment and the trade offs 56. involved. The level of GDP in 2021-22 crossed the pre-pandemic 2019-20 level not just in aggregate but in all components of aggregate demand. In terms of quarterly GDP, it has stayed above corresponding pre-pandemic quarter of 2019 since Q2 of 2021-22 and in Q3 it had exceeded pre-pandemic levels for all components. On the supply-side, the GVA data shows that in 2021-22 the output of all sectors, except the \u2018trade, transport, communication and broadcasting services\u2019 had surpassed the 2019- 20 level. In terms of quarterly data, output had exceeded pre-pandemic level in aggregate since Q2 of 2021-22 and in Q4 is likely to do so for all sectors, including \u2018trade, frequency indicators have shown distinct month-on-month improvements since December 2021. By February 2022, almost all indicators have moved above pre-pandemic levels, except a few, mainly automobile related, where activity has relapsed due to semi- conductor shortages. So, it is safe to assume that output has recovered now, though the improvements from hereon may remain moderate given the expected growth deceleration on account of war. 57. On inflation, it has breached the upper tolerance level and is expected to remain so in Q1 of 2022-23. There are upside risks that cannot be ignored. Global crude oil prices have been highly volatile of late and can move in either direction from here. The uncertainty on this account has large ramifications for projection of any macroeconomic variable. If the war ends and global recovery sustains, oil prices can move up again later this year once the effects of release of strategic reserves wane in 6 months. Gas prices can rise further if Russia cuts supplies to Europe or Europe implements plans to reduce dependence on Russian gas. However, energy prices can fall from here if war ends soon and no sanctions are levied by EU in this sector. The current upsurge in energy prices is masking the potential impact of the likes of EV hummers that portend a trend shift downwards in oil prices over the medium- term. Also, if oil prices persist at current high levels, it can trigger ramping up of tight oil. The expected easing of food prices even if monsoon is normal, runs the risk from elevated input costs, especially of fertilisers and diesel that can result in jacking up of floor that is set by minimum support prices (MSPs). Global food prices have already gone up substantially and supply shortages may persist for more than a year as sowing in war torn Ukraine will be impacted. More importantly, in my assessment, core inflation is expected to stay above 6% through 2022-23 as the price shock from the war in Ukraine will be transmitted through mineral and metals as soaring coal prices and Palladium group and other metal shortages seep through to retail levels. They will also bring down growth and the resultant demand destruction may put some lid on surging commodity prices. 58. The global shock can have large spillovers to India through multiple channels. First, accentuated supply chain disruptions will result in longer episode of cost-push inflation. Second, this will erode purchasing power and slow down the economy. Third, the CAD will rise, especially if negative real rates persist and impact domestic savings. The median rate on fresh rupee term deposits has a negative carry of about 2% in real terms. Fourth, while fiscal policies have scope to limit the pass-through of imported inflation, it will need to be balanced off in a manner that twin deficits remain sustainable. Fifth, the interest rates and exchange rates can have profound effects on growth and inflation through contesting channels, in which the capital flow channel could be the most important. Even as these risks amplify, India has strong buffers to withstand these shocks. There aren\u2019t too many fissures and once markets quickly price the shifts, the dynamics could turn favourable again. 59. So, what are the policy options in this backdrop? As the slowdown and impulses have hit us with monetary policy already being very inflationary accommodative, there is not enough room to pump prime growth. If output levels fall again, the negative output gap may help soften high inflation as the pass-through to retail levels may remain contained. However, lack of contestability and collusive behaviours have been seen in the past and the price rises can follow to protect margins. It is important to keep a sense of scarring and fall in potential output as large scarring will also mean an early closing of output gap causing inflationary pressures to accentuate. Recovering to pre-pandemic trend should not guide monetary policy at this stage and policy should focus on non-inflationary sustainable growth in the economy. A close watch on inflation expectations is necessary. If expectations are rising, especially if they turn unhinged and start rising faster than even actual inflation, monetary policy would have to reign in expectations to prevent a self-sustained inflationary spiral. Headline inflation has stayed elevated for long and has tested our tolerance. Even though the current high inflation is not primarily a monetary phenomenon it is critical to ensure that economic agents place the use of flexibility in the context of extra-ordinary circumstances that were prevailing and do not perceive an implicit upward drift in inflation target. Such a slip can affect inflation expectations. The best way to support growth on a durable basis is to have a strong commitment to low and stable inflation. I wish to sign off with this note. 60. Considering the emergence of a different growth-inflation trade-off, it is best to start withdrawing monetary accommodation through liquidity and rate actions that can begin with raising the floor and normalising the corridor. The policy will still stay accommodative as rates, even after lifting nominal rates, will stay below real neutral rate for foreseeable future. Monetary policy is not a rocket science, but the timing of the launch of the rocket is nevertheless important as monetary policy transmits to its final goals with long and variable lags. With a flatter Phillips curve, tackling inflation becomes that much harder as it may call for larger output sacrifice. So, a deft policy- mix is needed. We have varied tools and with right cross fertilisation of these tools it should be possible to bring back inflation closer to the target later without much growth sacrifice and without a very high terminal rate. It is important to note that the labour markets in India are yet to heat up and this is reflected in muted wage and house price pressures, below trend labour force participation rate and flattish unemployment levels. 61. Considering the above, I vote for leaving policy rate unchanged and for staying accommodative, while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation as indicated in the resolution. 62. In a world in which deglobalisation seems imminent, one thing has become globalised and that is the alarm about inflation. With 60 per cent of developed countries facing inflation above 5 per cent \u2013 unheard of since the 1980s \u2013 and more than half of developing countries experiencing inflation above 7 per cent, the climb in prices is testing societal tolerance levels. 63. The view that increasingly occupies centre-stage is that irrespective of whether supply bottlenecks are the driver or pent-up demand, it will become more difficult to tame inflation the longer the fight is delayed. To quote an influential view, it will make central banks unpopular, but they have been there before. The rationale underlying this point of view is that whether the jump in oil and other commodity prices will be short-lived or not is not known; but if these prices ignite and levitate the prices of other goods and services sympathetically, the fear will gain ground amongst the public that inflation is going to stay high for a while, and this can end up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Hence financial markets race ahead of central banks in foretelling what they should do, by how much and by when. 64. Supply disruptions, soaring commodity prices and ensuing financial market turbulence no more tell about fears of the shape of future inflation \u2013 the worst fears are already materialising. Instead they darken the outlook for growth. Macroeconomic conditions are the toughest for developing countries, with acute shortages of even essentials showing up alongside spiralling prices. On the one hand, the cost of foreign currency debt for EMEs is rising and on the other, they are forced to drain currency reserves in order to shore up exchange rates. Higher commodity prices could also complicate the situation for governments that have been striving to mitigate the impact of the pandemic by offering food and energy subsidies to households. 65. The key question is: will it be a goldilocks moment? Will central banks deliver the perfect disinflation, the so-called soft landing? Or will they overshoot the runway and precipitate an unwanted recession on a world weary with pandemic woes, war and worn and torn supply chains? In fact, the view gaining ground is that inflation is at heights that have shattered glass ceilings and the only way to excoriate it is to force a recession - the so called hard landing. The dilemma is even sharper for central banks with dual mandates \u2013 will their remits allow them to kill the economy for price stability? 66. Geopolitical risks appear overwhelming at this juncture and over the foreseeable near-term. The RBI has been preparing for tail risks in either direction. First, out of the pandemic-related liquidity overhang, an amount of \u20b92.94 lakh crore has been withdrawn from the system with the lapse of measures/repayments on due dates. Second, open market sales and forex operations during the year have withdrawn liquidity of the order of \u20b92.3 lakh crore. Third, market-based auctions with a menu of maturities have been conducted with a view to get market participants attuned to the alignment of money market rates with normal liquidity management procedures. 67. The RBI is in the process of completing the migration to a fully fledged liquidity management framework that is perfectly symmetrical \u2013 standing facilities at the upper and lower bounds with the policy rate at the centre; access on all days of the week, throughout the year; and restoration of the corridor to its pre-pandemic width and operation. During the course of 2022-23 and up to April 2023, all pandemic-related extraordinary measures will cease. 68. These actions empower the RBI at a moment of reckoning. If, as the projections show, inflation persists in high reaches, the drainage of liquidity already achieved and planned for the year ahead will reduce risks of excess liquidity fanning inflationary pressures and posing threats to financial stability. It will also facilitate the transmission of policy impulses across market segments and the interest rate structure. If, on the other hand, risk sentiment improves globally and India receives large volumes of capital flows, the standing deposit facility expands the capability of the RBI to undertake full and seamless sterilisation without running out of instruments. This will help to keep monetary expansion consistent with the outlook on inflation and growth. 69. Accordingly, I vote for status quo on the policy rate. I also vote for the stance as formulated in the MPC\u2019s resolution. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets at a time when tectonic shifts in 70. geopolitical environment are materially affecting the global and domestic outlook on both inflation and growth. Just as the global economy seemed to be on the cusp of returning to normalcy from the pandemic, the war in Europe and subsequent sanctions have further clouded the outlook. The war-induced price spikes in food, oil, gas, fertiliser and several key industrial inputs, together with continued supply chain bottlenecks, are posing major upside risks to inflation which has already scaled multi- decadal highs in several countries. At the same time, the war poses major downside risks to global growth in the wake of trade restrictions, sanctions, elevated uncertainties and the flare up in the prices of food and energy. Global financial markets are on tenterhooks reacting to the toxic mix of supply and demand shocks and the varying pace of monetary policy normalisation in advanced countries. Most emerging market economies are caught in the vortex of risk-off sentiments marked by capital outflows and rising bond yields. To say that the world is going through extremely volatile times would be an understatement. 71. These developments are likely to have significant long-term implications for the global economy caused by supply chain reconfigurations, trade and technology fragmentation, and defence and energy security considerations. Emerging market economies find themselves in a much more difficult situation as their economic recovery from the pandemic remains incomplete even as inflation continues its ascent. Central banks in these economies face the difficult trade-off between containing inflation and nurturing growth. The situation is particularly challenging for net oil importing countries like India. 72. The domestic inflation outlook presented in the February 2022 MPC meeting has undergone a significant upward shift since the start of the war on February 24, 2022, with the escalation of conflict and subsequent turmoil in global commodity markets. The increase in crude oil price and its direct and indirect effects on CPI contributed to around 60 per cent of the upward revision in projections with the other major contributor being the spillovers coming from the global food price shocks on wheat, edible oil and feed cost pressures impacting on poultry, milk and dairy product prices. In the current scenario, continuation and further deepening of supply side measures would alleviate food price pressures and also mitigate cost-push pressures across manufacturing and services. 73. Emerging from the Omicron wave, India\u2019s economic recovery remains on track, although there are weak spots \u2013 private consumption and investment are still subdued and contact-based services, although catching up, are yet to recover fully. There is also a risk that the ongoing recovery, which is already strained by the current crisis, may get undermined if there is rapid tightening of financial conditions. In these circumstances, policy making has to be nuanced and nimble. 74. Consistent with the strategy of focusing on withdrawal of accommodation, the Reserve Bank intends to gradually withdraw surplus liquidity over a multi-year period, keeping in mind the evolving macroeconomic and financial developments and the stance of monetary policy, while maintaining adequate liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy. Signalling this intent, the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) corridor is being normalised to a width of 50 bps that was prevailing before the pandemic. The liquidity rebalancing operations of the RBI have prepared the market for this normalisation of the LAF corridor. 75. The current geopolitical situation has led to an upward revision of our inflation projections for 2022-23. The estimates now point to inflation remaining above the upper tolerance band in the near-term even as growth projections have undergone downward revisions. These are indicative of the sheer magnitude of the adverse exogenous supply and price shocks. While the risks to domestic growth call for continued accommodative monetary policy, inflationary pressures necessitate monetary policy action. The circumstances warrant prioritising inflation and anchoring of inflation expectations in the sequence of objectives to safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability, while being mindful of the ongoing growth recovery. There is also a need to avoid undue disruptions in the financial markets. Given this delicate balance between inflation and growth, I vote for retaining the repo rate at 4.0 per cent and maintaining the accommodative stance while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. The situation is dynamic and fast changing, and we should constantly re-assess the situation and tailor our actions accordingly.

Marg, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 The thirty fifth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during May 2 and 4, 2022 as an off-cycle meeting to reassess the evolving inflation-growth dynamics and the impact of the developments after its meeting of April 6-8, 2022. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Indian 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic assessment, and 4. alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (May 4, 2022) decided to:  The MPC also decided to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below; 6. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting in April 2022, disruptions, shortages and escalating prices induced by the geopolitical tensions and sanctions have persisted and downside risks have increased. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised down its forecast of global output growth for 2022 by 0.8 percentage point to 3.6 per cent, in a span of less than three months. The World Trade Organization has scaled down projection of world trade growth for 2022 by 1.7 percentage points to 3.0 per cent. Domestic Economy 7. Domestic economic activity stabilised in March-April with the ebbing of the third wave of COVID-19 and the easing of restrictions. Urban demand appears to have maintained expansion but some weakness persists in rural demand. Investment activity seems to be gaining traction. Merchandise exports recorded double digit expansion for the fourteenth consecutive month in April. Non-oil non-gold imports also grew robustly on the back of improving domestic demand. Overall system liquidity remained in large surplus. Bank credit rose (y-o-y) by 8. 11.1 per cent as on April 22, 2022. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves declined by US$ 6.9 billion in 2022-23 (up to April 22) to US$ 600.4 billion. In March 2022, headline CPI inflation surged to 7.0 per cent from 6.1 per cent 9. in February, largely reflecting the impact of geopolitical spillovers. Food inflation increased by 154 basis points to 7.5 per cent and core inflation rose by 54 bps to 6.4 per cent. The rapid rise in inflation is occurring in an environment in which inflationary pressures are broadening across the world. The IMF projects inflation to increase by 2.6 percentage points to 5.7 per cent in advanced economies in 2022 and by 2.8 percentage points to 8.7 per cent in emerging market and developing economies. 10. Heightened uncertainty surrounds the inflation trajectory, which is heavily contingent upon the evolving geopolitical situation. Global commodity price dynamics are driving the path of food inflation in India, including prices of inflation sensitive items that are impacted by global shortages due to output losses and export restrictions by key producing countries. International crude oil prices remain high but volatile, posing considerable upside risks to the inflation trajectory through both direct and indirect effects. Core inflation is likely to remain elevated in the coming months, reflecting high domestic pump prices and pressures from prices of essential medicines. Renewed lockdowns and supply chain disruptions due to resurgence of COVID-19 infections in major economies could sustain higher logistics costs for longer. All these factors impart significant upside risks to the inflation trajectory set out in the April statement of the MPC. 11. As regard the outlook for domestic economic activity, the forecast of a normal southwest monsoon brightens the prospects for kharif production. The recovery in contact-intensive services is expected to be sustained, with the ebbing of the third wave and the growing vaccination coverage. Investment activity should get an uplift from robust government capex, improving capacity utilisation, stronger corporate balance sheets and congenial financial conditions. On the other hand, the worsening external environment, elevated commodity prices and persistent supply bottlenecks pose formidable headwinds, along with volatility spillovers from monetary policy normalisation in advanced economies. On balance, the Indian economy appears capable of weathering the deterioration in geopolitical conditions but it is prudent to continuously monitor the balance of risks. 12. Against this background, the MPC is of the view that while economic activity is navigating the vortex of forces confronting the world with resilience on the strength of underlying fundamentals and buffers, the risks to the near-term inflation outlook are rapidly materialising, as reflected the developments thereafter. In this milieu, the MPC expects inflation to rule at elevated levels, warranting resolute and calibrated steps to anchor inflation expectations and contain second round effects. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.40 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. in 13. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to increase the policy repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.4 per cent. 14. All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on May 18, 2022. 14. All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 15. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during June 6-8, 2022. Voting on the Resolution to increase the policy repo rate to 4.4 per cent Q1FY2023 in the April meeting, well above 4.9 per cent projected in the February meeting. 18. It was also seen that overall GDP growth recovery, while significant, was incomplete, especially in terms of consumption demand. The growth environment was also subject to significant uncertainty in the short-term, given the supply chain interruptions in the global markets. GDP growth rate for FY2023 was projected at 7.2 per cent in April, below the 7.8 per cent projected in February. The emerging need for policy response in the context of inflationary pressures 19. was clearly recognised. But the uncertainty of both growth and inflation trajectories as a consequence of global economic conditions was also a significant consideration. 20. The CPI inflation rate for March 2022 that became available a week after the April meeting, showed a sharp increase in the headline number and the price rise was widely spread across all the main consumption items. The headline inflation rate was above 6 per cent for the third successive month in 2022. The inflationary pressures, while substantially emanating from the external developments - Russia- Ukraine war and the sanctions from the Western countries leading to supply disruptions - there are additional concerns in the form of ban on palm oil exports by Indonesia and the restrictions on economic activities in China as a result of emergence of new Covid 19 cases. 21. These external price and supply shocks have led to inflationary pressures both directly at the retail level and also indirectly through cost pressures on domestic supplies. The energy and food price increases in the international markets have impacted domestic prices. The external market conditions also have implications for trade and current account deficits and in turn, prices. The accommodative monetary conditions now in place to support growth are also not moderating transmission of price rise impulses through the supply chain. 22. On the growth front, the improvements are reflected in the broader indicators such as bank credit and GST collections and specific indicators such as PMI for manufacturing and services for the month of April 2022. Exports have been a driver of aggregate demand through FY 2022. However, uncertainty over growth trajectory is also significant in the context of expectations of slower world GDP and trade growth in 2023. the present assessment of 23. Given the inflation and economic growth conditions, monetary policy measures to break the inflation dynamics have become necessary. While the impact of such monetary policy measures may affect growth momentum adversely in the short-term, the overall external conditions also require that domestic inflation pressures are contained quickly. With some optimism on the lifting of the shadow of Covid pandemic on the domestic supply chains, focus is now needed on achieving price stability, with the headline inflation rate moving close to the target of 4 per cent. Each step would have to be taken keeping in view the evolving conditions. 24. Accordingly, I vote to increase the policy repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.4 per cent. 25. I also vote to remain accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Indian growth remains quite robust despite a global slowdown especially since 26. the threat of a possible 4th Covid-19 wave seems to be receding. Contact industries are also seeing a revival due to pent-up demand. As more and more countries seek to diversify their imports, MSMEs are benefitting from export orders. 27. Inflation is a concern, now. It has overshot official and private predictions in March as a result of unprecedented shocks. The prolonged Ukraine war is keeping international crude oil prices high. It is also aggravating food prices. 28. The history of past shocks in India shows food and oil price inflation together can give rise to second round effects. This is what happened in the 2010s. But so far pass through to wages is absent and consumer demand is soft. Higher agricultural productivity, food grain stocks, appropriate policy response, lower energy intensity and waning of war related price pressures may allow this time to be different. 29. Inflation is high due to multiple supply shocks following each other. Even so, in an inflation targeting regime it is necessary to respond to inflation persistently above tolerance bands in order to anchor expectations. 30. It is also necessary to respond in order to prevent large deviations in real rates, which cause risks of overheating or of a slowdown. Post GFC real interest rates were highly negative leading to overheating and in the 2010s they swung to large positive numbers (peaking at 4.85 per cent1), aggravating the slowdown. Policy should aim for equilibrium real rates and avoid large swings in real rates. 31. In view of a reasonable recovery and the sharp rise in inflation, which will also raise inflation projections, frontloading of rate hikes is required to prevent the real rate becoming too negative. Among risks from negative real interest rates include households buying gold thus aggravating the current account deficit and hurting financial intermediation. 32. In my last minutes I had warned that the pace of exit depends on incoming data and repo hikes could follow the normalization of the LAF corridor. Markets were already over-reacting to global risk and to adjustment in liquidity that started last year and have priced in excessive rate hikes. Since consumer demand continues to be soft, and inflation is likely to reduce it further, such excessive rate hikes may not be necessary to impose the quantum of output sacrifice required to moderate inflation. A surprise in timing with an unannounced meeting at the start of the rate hike cycle maybe better to mitigate further over-reaction. I vote 34. A credible demonstration of commitment to inflation targeting, that brings down inflation expectations to the tolerance band, together with OMOs, should reduce the excessive yield spread. Spreads widened when short rates were cut and should now narrow when they rise, flattening the yield curve. Relatively good growth, and domestic liquidity in surplus, will support the stock market despite withdrawal of excess accommodation. There is healthy diversification with domestic investors taking a contrary view to foreign investors. 35. Government supply-side action can also reduce future rate rises, output sacrifice and borrowing costs. Both central and state taxes are buoyant and likely to exceed any rise in subsidy costs because of the Ukraine crisis, giving them space to cut taxes on fuels. Countercyclical fuel taxes are necessary to prevent a ratchet effect raising inflation, if fuel prices rise much more than they fall because taxes rise when crude oil prices fall but do not fall when prices rise. Such a ratchet occurred in the era of administered prices and is not compatible with inflation targeting. World crude oil prices were lower in early 2021 than they were in mid-2014. But Indian prices were higher. Fertilizer subsidy would also be reduced if energy price rise is contained. States that did not cut taxes in November last year should begin, that will trigger a second round of cuts. These have some of the highest fuel prices in the country, at a time when international crude oil prices are persisting at high levels and being passed through to consumers. 36. MPC meetings outside the annual calendar are at the sole discretion of the Governor based on his opinion that an additional meeting is required. Therefore, I confine my statement to the consideration of the action to be taken at this additional meeting. 37. In my statement in April, I stated that the principal reason for not taking immediate action on the policy rate at that time was that the forward guidance given in the February meeting effectively precluded such action. I also stated that the withdrawal of the forward guidance and the absence of any stance in April meant that in future meetings, the MPC would consider itself completely free to take any action on the policy rates that may be warranted. This meeting is taking place almost a month after the April meeting, and the MPC is now at liberty to consider the rate increase that it could have done in April itself in the absence of the February forward guidance. 38. Since April, inflation risks have become more pronounced both in terms of magnitude and in terms of persistence. On the other hand, the growth shock appears to be less severe than I feared initially, as most nowcast estimates suggest that the economy is coping reasonably well with the geopolitical tensions and the Chinese lockdown. In this context, the need for monetary tightening has become much more acute. Moreover, there is a lot of catching up to do because the MPC (a) rightly prioritized economic recovery at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and early 2021, and (b) delayed the normalization by continuing the forward guidance for far too long after the pandemic abated. This means that it is now imperative to front-load the rate action to the extent possible. It appears to me that more than 100 basis points of rate increases needs to be 39. carried out very soon. My preference therefore is for a 50 basis points increase in the repo rate in this meeting. The majority of the MPC is in favour of 40 basis points for reasons which are not very clear to me. Whatever symbolic or psychological benefit there may be from keeping the hike below 50 basis points is outweighed by the simplicity and clarity of moving in round multiples of 25 basis points. Also reducing the hike by 10 basis points now would require an extra 10 basis point hike at some point (and perhaps sooner rather than later). Nevertheless, I have thought it fit not to dissent on this issue as the optimal rate hike is not something that can be calculated with mathematical precision, and 40 basis points is not materially different from 50 basis points. I am thankful to the majority for not making my decision more difficult by choosing a 37.5 basis point hike (exactly mid-way between 25 and 50). In view of all this, I vote in favour of increasing the policy repo rate to 4.40 per cent. then the real policy rate after this meeting is lower than it was after the April meeting because the published headline CPI inflation has risen by much more than 40 basis points between the two meetings. Of course, it is more reasonable to calculate the real policy rate by subtracting the forecast inflation rate 3-4 quarters ahead, but even if one does that, it is obvious that the real policy rate continues to be sharply negative, and therefore highly accommodative. The first part of the second resolution is therefore simply a statement of fact, and the operative portion of the resolution is the second part which talks about withdrawal of accommodation. I have already explained why an expeditious withdrawal of accommodation is warranted. 41. However, most of the analyst commentary on the April meeting seemed to interpret the phrase \u201cremain accommodative\u201d as a stance despite the conscious decision to drop the word \u201cstance\u201d. I hope that this time around, the MPC\u2019s intent will be more clearly understood, but if that does not happen, the MPC must consider rephrasing this resolution. It would not be wise for the MPC to persist with language that is pedantically correct, but falls short in communicative efficacy. But such rephrasing is a matter for a future meeting, and this time around, I vote in favour of the decision focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan The global macroeconomic and financial environment has turned extremely 42. adverse since February 2022 with the start of the war in Ukraine and is posing significant challenges to real-time macroeconomic assessment and management. Against this backdrop, it would be useful to briefly recap the fast-paced developments over the past 3-4 months. At the time of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting of February 10, 2022, before the outbreak of the war, inflation trajectory was projected to moderate significantly to the target of 4 per cent by Q3:2022-23, with an average inflation rate of 4.5 per cent for the financial year 2022-23, premised on stronger seasonal winter correction of vegetables prices, a likely bumper Rabi harvest and further normalization of supply chains in the backdrop of ebbing of COVID-19 remain for monetary policy accommodative, to prioritise growth and support the domestic recovery. infections. This provided 43. The situation, however, changed drastically since the start of the war in Europe on 24th February. Taking cognizance of the potential adverse global commodity price spillovers, the MPC resolution of April 8, 2022 raised the inflation projection for 2022-23 by 120 bps to 5.7 per cent. With the war posing sizeable upside risks to the inflation trajectory and downside risks to domestic growth, the MPC, on balance, continued with the accommodative stance, though price stability was prioritised over growth along with a focus on withdrawal of accommodation in a calibrated manner over a multi-year period. The liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor was also normalised while introducing the standing deposit facility (SDF). The MPC highlighted five major risks in its April resolution to the baseline inflation and growth trajectory: (i) the ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions; (ii) generalised hardening of global commodity prices; (iii) the likelihood of prolonged supply chain disruptions; (iv) dislocations in trade and capital flows; and (v) divergent monetary policy responses and associated volatility. It was expected that these risks will play out over time, but recent developments suggest that the upside inflation risks have materialised earlier than anticipated as reflected in the March CPI print and projected higher April print, warranting an off-cycle meet of MPC. 44. The March 2022 CPI release pointed to a larger than anticipated, broad-based pass-through of global price shocks to the domestic economy. The hardening of food inflation, which in January was predominantly driven by cereals and vegetables, has since then spread to meat and fish, milk, edible oils, spices and prepared meals in addition to cereals and vegetables. Further intensification of core inflation pressures (CPI excluding food and fuel) to 6.4 per cent in March emanated from broad-based price pressures across sub-groups. Barring housing, pan-tobacco and intoxicants and education, inflation in all core sub-groups was above 6 per cent. Let me give another perspective on the generalization of inflation in the latest 45. print. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, October 2020 registered the highest headline inflation reading at 7.6 per cent. In October 2020, the key drivers were vegetables, transportation, meat and fish, edible oils, personal care and pulses. These sub-groups (with a weight of around 28 per cent in the CPI basket) accounted for about 60 per cent of the inflation. In March 2022, the contribution of these items was only 41 per cent to the headline inflation of 7.0 per cent. This suggests a significant change in the drivers of inflation in the recent period. 46. The broadening of inflation pressures is also reflected in various CPI diffusion indices2. There has been a sharp pick-up in these indices for price increases at or above a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of 6 per cent, especially in March, confirming that it is not just incidence of broadening of price increases in CPI but also that of price increases at a very high rate. This is true for headline as well as core categories. The trimmed mean measures of CPI inflation3 suggest that their pace of increase accelerated in March. 47. All of these indicate that amidst geo-political turmoil and heightened uncertainty, the sharp escalation in cost-push pressures is translating into a generalised upsurge in inflation, which became evident after the March CPI print was released on April 12th. It may be recalled that the CPI print crossed the 6 per cent mark even earlier on two occasions in 2020 and 2021. In each of these episodes, the MPC rightly decided to look through them as transitory price shocks. Though the current price rise is also essentially supply-shock driven, it cannot be ignored given its broad-based nature, spillover effects and persistence, which has a risk of unhinging inflation expectations. Thus, at this stage of macroeconomic dynamics, it is necessary to reinstate the primacy of price stability and strengthen the credibility of monetary policy through demonstrable actions. 48. With economic recovery better entrenched than before, it is time to address the concerns on the inflation front, the dynamics of which has been fundamentally altered by the outbreak of the conflict in Europe. Though monetary policy may not have a direct influence on exogenous global commodity price shocks brought about by the war, it can play an important role in avoiding the generalisation of inflationary pressures. If monetary policy decides to see-through these shocks, and especially if they are not transitory, inflation expectations could become unanchored, leading to a persistent upward drift that may not revert to the pre-shock level even after the initial shock completely dissipates. Given the recent inflation dynamics, a repo rate hike of more than the conventional 25 basis points would be more effective in anchoring expectations. I, therefore, vote for an increase in the policy repo rate by 40 bps, which is appropriate at this juncture, being neither too small nor too excessive. It is expected that this pre-emptive action in an off-cycle meeting will have more pronounced effect. I also endorse the unchanged stance from the April policy which remains accommodative, consistent with our stance of maintaining adequate liquidity to sustain credit offtake and meet the productive requirements of the economy. In this regard, the increase in CRR by 50 bps is in consonance with our objective of withdrawing surplus liquidity gradually which would attenuate any unintended effects on the price front. 49. Geopolitical spillovers have thrust upon us a surge in the momentum of inflation we can ill afford. As long as the geopolitical crisis and retaliatory actions persist, so will inflation. As long as inflation stays and broadens in its ambit, people will increasingly be convinced it is going out of reach and this could un-anchor their expectations about its future path. So monetary policy authorities are being forced to respond to an elevation in prices brought on by shortages and bottlenecks they can do nothing about since the problem confronting them is not overstimulated demand but insufficient supply. In the absence of supply augmenting measures and/or easing of supply bottlenecks, they will do what they can do \u2013 front-load their actions, compress demand and render the recovery stillborn. Globally, stagflation could be transitioning from a risk scenario to a baseline scenario. The stagflationary shock is global but everywhere it is being exacerbated by country-specific factors in a synchronised way. The still raw scars of the pandemic will become even more excruciating to bear and more lasting. 50. At the same time, financial markets are telling us that the configurations that exist today \u2013 hardening US yields; ever strengthening US dollar; equity sell-offs; emerging currency depreciations and capital outflows; rising debt distress \u2013 are reminiscent of 1993-1994 after which followed a cascade of emerging market crises. At least, all the symptoms of a generalised financial deleveraging are in place. 51. In this milieu, a measured approach and a cool head is warranted. Recent incoming data suggest that India\u2019s macro-fundamentals, barring imported food and fuel inflation, are still intact and in sync with the recovery that has been tenaciously making its way through waves of the pandemic. Labour absorption in manufacturing and services is rising, capacity utilisation is improving and there are signs of new investment gradually coming in. Yet, the momentum of the recovery is still below full strength, warranting policy support. IPOs and the rotation of risk-on risk-off portfolio flows may give India a brief respite on a given day but on other days plunge our markets back into the turmoil that other EMEs are going through. 52. Against this turbulent backdrop and with headline inflation persisting above the upper tolerance band for the third month in a row with signs of second order effects, the approach of reversing the extraordinary accommodation \u2013 in terms of both the policy rate and liquidity - that was undertaken in response to the pandemic is, to my mind, the right approach. When it is done, we will have reached a stage of neutral accommodation \u2013 in contrast to extraordinary pandemic time accommodation \u2013 from where the next stage responses can be calibrated. Accordingly, I vote for an increase of 40 basis points in the policy rate \u2013 reversing the reduction in the policy rate effected on May 22, 2020 \u2013 and for the stance of remaining accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation, as articulated in the MPC\u2019s resolution of May 4, 2022. 53. In my MPC statement of April 8, 2022, I had stated that the Reserve Bank will use all its policy levers to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability while enhancing the economy\u2019s resilience. I had also emphasised that the situation is dynamic and fast changing and our actions will be tailored accordingly. Together with the measures announced that day, the idea behind these statements was to convey the readiness of the RBI to effectively deal with the surge in inflation due to the war in Europe. Events since then have led to a further deterioration in the geo-political situation even as domestic inflation became more broad-based warranting immediate remedial measures. The off-cycle meeting held on 2nd and 4th May 2022 may be seen in this background. 54. Developments after the April MPC have caused further concern. First, headline CPI inflation for March, released on 12th April 2022, increased beyond expectations to 7 per cent, as the impact of adverse global commodity price shocks was felt across the CPI basket. Second, global commodity and food prices as reflected in indices of the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the World Bank have touched historical highs in March with implications for the domestic food price situation. These pressures are likely to persist. Third, almost all measures of core inflation have registered a sharp pick-up in March, well above 6 per cent. Fourth, the revision in administered electricity tariffs across many states and the increase in prices of essential medicines pose further risks to inflation over the short-term. Fifth, the war in Europe \u2013 with its attendant consequences for supply chains, shortages and prices \u2013 is now expected to last much longer than earlier anticipated. Under these circumstances, the inflation print for April \u2013 to be released on May 12th \u2013 is expected to be further elevated. Hence, it becomes necessary to act through an off- cycle policy meeting. Waiting for one month till the June MPC would mean losing that much time while war related inflationary pressures accentuated. Further, it may necessitate a much stronger action in the June MPC which is avoidable. 55. Meanwhile, the rebound in domestic economic activity is gradually getting generalised. Improving contact-intensive services amidst revival in urban demand is driving personal consumption. The outlook for agriculture remains positive in the wake of normal southwest monsoon forecast for 2022, which would support rural consumption. Investment activity is gaining momentum with higher capacity utilisation and capital goods production registering an uptick. Exports remain resilient while persisting high import growth is suggestive of a revival in domestic demand. Nevertheless, higher global commodity prices in the wake of a long drawn geopolitical conflict, protracted shortage of critical inputs and policy tightening by major central banks pose downside risks to domestic economic activity. The worsening outlook of inflation warrants timely action to forestall second 56. round effects which could lead to unanchoring of inflation expectations. Heightened uncertainty and volatile financial markets could also add to such unhinging of expectations. Accordingly, decisive and measured monetary policy response is necessary to avoid any unintended shocks to the economy. 57. Considering all these factors, it has now become necessary to increase the repo rate on top of the increase in liquidity absorption rate done in April, 2022 through the standing deposit facility (SDF). Accordingly, I vote for an increase in the policy repo rate by 40 bps which is a reversal of our May 22, 2020 measure. Going ahead, we should keep our focus on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target, while supporting growth. I, therefore, vote for maintaining status quo on the stance as in April policy. Further, the Reserve Bank will continue with liquidity withdrawal in a phased manner over a multi-year period in sync with monetary policy and macroeconomic developments. Given the persistent liquidity overhang, a 50 bps increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by the Reserve Bank signals our intent on withdrawing accommodation over a multi-year period. 58. As several storms hit together, our monetary policy response should be seen as an important step to steady the ship. The Indian as well as global evidence clearly shows that high inflation persistence hurts savings, investment, competitiveness and growth. It has also more pronounced adverse effects on the poorer segments of the population. Our monetary policy actions today aimed at lowering inflation and anchoring inflation expectations should thus help to strengthen the medium-term growth prospects of the economy and protect the purchasing power of the weaker sections of society. Given the highly uncertain situation, the incoming data and information would be constantly monitored to reassess the outlook and take necessary measures. Just as we had remained steadfastly vigilant and responded to fragilities in growth caused by the pandemic during the last two years, this time around also we will remain equally resolute and committed to bringing back inflation closer to the target through all possible instruments at our disposal.

Marg, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 The thirty sixth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during June 6 to 8, 2022. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the 3. Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (June 8, 2022) decided to: Increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 50 basis points to 4.90 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 4.65 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.15 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement Since the MPC\u2019s meeting in May 2022, the global economy continues to 6. grapple with multi-decadal high inflation and slowing growth, persisting geopolitical tensions and sanctions, elevated prices of crude oil and other commodities and lingering COVID-19 related supply chain bottlenecks. Global financial markets have been roiled by turbulence amidst growing stagflation concerns, leading to a tightening of global financial conditions and risks to the growth outlook and financial stability. 7. According to the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on May 31, 2022, India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021-22 was 8.7 per cent. This works out to 1.5 per cent above the pre-pandemic level (2019-20). In Q4:2021-22, real GDP growth decelerated to 4.1 per cent from 5.4 per cent in Q3, dragged down mainly by weakness in private consumption on the back of the Omicron wave. 8. Available information for April-May 2022 indicates a broadening of the recovery in economic activity. Urban demand is recovering and rural demand is gradually improving. Merchandise exports posted robust double-digit growth for the fifteenth month in a row during May while non-oil non-gold imports continued to expand at a healthy pace, pointing to recovery of domestic demand. 9. Overall system liquidity remains in large surplus, with the average daily absorption under the LAF moderating to \u20b95.5 lakh crore during May 4 - May 31 from \u20b97.4 lakh crore during April 8 - May 3, 2022 in consonance with the policy of gradual withdrawal of accommodation. Money supply (M3) and bank credit from commercial banks rose (y-o-y) by 8.8 per cent and 12.1 per cent, respectively, as on May 20, 2022. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 601.4 billion as on May 27, 2022. 10. CPI headline inflation rose further from 7.0 per cent in March 2022 to 7.8 per cent in April 2022, reflecting broad-based increase in all its major constituents. Food inflation pressures accentuated, led by cereals, milk, fruits, vegetables, spices and prepared meals. Fuel inflation was driven up by a rise in LPG and kerosene prices. Core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) hardened across almost all components, dominated by the transport and communication sub-group. 11. the consequent elevated commodity prices impart considerable uncertainty to the domestic inflation outlook. The restrictions on wheat exports should improve the domestic supplies but the shortfall in the rabi production due to the heat wave could be an offsetting risk. The forecast of a normal south-west monsoon augurs well for the kharif agricultural production and the food price outlook. Edible oil prices remain under pressure on adverse global supply conditions, notwithstanding some recent correction due to the lifting of export ban by a major supplier. Consequent to the recent reduction in excise duties, domestic retail prices of petroleum products have moderated. International crude oil prices, however, remain elevated, with risks of further pass-through to domestic pump prices. There are also upside risks from revisions in the prices of electricity. Early results from manufacturing, services and infrastructure sector firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s surveys expect further input and output price pressures going forward. Taking into account these factors, and on the assumption of a normal monsoon in 2022 and average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 105 per barrel, inflation is now projected at 6.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q1 at 7.5 per cent; Q2 at 7.4 per cent; Q3 at 6.2 per cent; and Q4 at 5.8 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). 12. The recovery in domestic economic activity is gathering strength. Rural consumption should benefit from the likely normal south-west monsoon and the expected improvement in agricultural prospects. A rebound in contact-intensive services is likely to bolster urban consumption, going forward. Investment activity is expected to be supported by improving capacity utilisation, the government\u2019s capex push, and strengthening bank credit. Growth of merchandise and services exports is set to sustain the recent buoyancy. Spillovers from prolonged geopolitical tensions, elevated commodity prices, continued supply bottlenecks and tightening global financial conditions nevertheless weigh on the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, the real GDP growth projection for 2022-23 is retained at 7.2 per cent, with Q1 at 16.2 per cent; Q2 at 6.2 per cent; Q3 at 4.1 per cent; and Q4 at 4.0 per cent, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 2). 13. Inflation risks flagged in the April and May resolutions of the MPC have materialised. The projections indicate that inflation is likely to remain above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through the first three quarters of 2022-23. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the inflation trajectory due to global growth risks and geopolitical tensions. The supply side measures taken by the government would help to alleviate some cost-push pressures. At the same time, however, the MPC notes that continuing shocks to food inflation could sustain pressures on headline inflation. Persisting inflationary pressures could set in motion second round effects on headline CPI. Hence, there is a need for calibrated monetary policy action to keep inflation expectations anchored and restrain the broadening of price pressures. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 14. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 per cent. 15. All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 16. 15. All members, namely, Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on June 22, 2022. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during August 2-4, 2022. Voting on the Resolution to increase the policy repo rate to 4.90 per cent 18. The inflationary pressures have increased significantly since the MPC meetings of April 2022 and May 2022. The headline CPI inflation rose to 7.0 per cent in March and 7.8 per cent in April, YOY basis. The inflation rate was also at or above the upper level of the tolerance band of inflation target in January and February. The CPI headline increased by 0.96% in March and 1.4% in April, MOM basis, reversing the moderate increase or declining pattern seen in the previous three months of December 2021- February 2022, reflecting the increased price pressures, particularly in March and April. The broadening of the inflationary pressure is also seen in the rising rates of the three major components of CPI- food, fuel and miscellaneous. In the case of food, the MOM increase in CPI in March and April were 1.3 and 1.4 per cent, respectively, reversing the declining pattern during December 2021- February 2022. The CPI-Fuel & Light group rose by 3.1 per cent in April (MOM), the highest pace since July 2011. While the inflation rate has been rising since October 2021, in the period since March 2022 its trajectory has been significantly steeper from the previous months. 19. As the supply side of the economy began to return to some normalcy after the successive waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the rising commodity prices in the international markets have remained a major cause of rising input costs in 2021. The sharp increase in the momentum of prices since March is mainly due to the global supply disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war and its aftermath leading to spikes in international commodity prices. In the case of food inflation, the supply interruptions in the international markets on account of both production shortfalls and war induced supply restrictions of edible oils and wheat have exacerbated the emerging supply-demand imbalance. The impact on fertiliser and other input supplies add to the cost of supply across the agricultural sector. Energy prices in general have been affected by supply disruptions and continued demand. 20. While the domestic monetary and economic policies remained supportive of growth through the pandemic period, achieving sustained growth momentum has been a challenging goal both as a result of the repeated waves of the pandemic and its global impact. At the global level the uncertainty over the timing of the end of the pandemic continues as sudden increase in infections has been reported in a number of countries. The provisional estimates (PE) of estimates GDP released by the National Statistical Office place the GDP growth for 2021-22 at 8.7 per cent reflecting catch-up of private final consumption expenditure, gross fixed capital formation and overall GDP, all measured in constant prices, with the pre-pandemic year 2019-20. The YOY growth of GDP in Q4:FY2021-22 is 4.1 per cent, 6.7 per cent over the previous quarter. In terms of GVA, all the major segments of the economy, agriculture, industry, and services inclusive of construction in 2021-22 exceeded the 2019-20 levels. In the services sector, only segment that includes the contact intensive \u2018trade, hotels and transport\u2019 subsectors, the GVA is yet to reach the pre- pandemic level. 21. More recent data on the economy remains positive on the whole, with broad based indicators such as non-food bank credit, GST collections and toll collections showing significant growth YOY basis up to May 2022. In the case of petrol and diesel consumption, for which data are available up to April 2022, YOY growth rate is higher than in the previous month. PMI for manufacturing in May 2022 has remained marginally lower compared to April and in the case of services, PMI has improved in May. The RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys reflect business expectations of higher output/ turnover over the quarters in FY2022-23 particularly in the second half of the year. Merchandise exports in US$ value for April and May 2022 more than doubled compared to the same period 2020-21 and also exceeded the values in the same period in 2019-20. Imports have also increased sharply reflecting growing domestic economic activity. However, there are clearly uncertainties regarding the growth prospects, particularly in view of the emerging adverse global demand conditions with the global output and trade volume growth now expected to be lower in 2022 than in 2021. Sharp tightening of monetary policy in several major advanced economies has also adverse implications for capital flows, financial markets and exchange rate for India. The RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey conducted during May 2-May 11, 2022 in the major urban areas shows weaker optimism in the general economic conditions for one-year ahead, with overall household spending expected to increase due to higher \u2018essential expenditure\u2019, also for one-year ahead. 22. Taking into account the present trends and projections of major indicators, the real GDP growth YOY basis for FY2022-23 has been retained at 7.2 per cent as projected in April 2022 meeting. As noted above, there are clearly uncertainties, particularly relating to the global macroeconomic conditions. The RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted during May 2022 has the median forecast of 7.2 per cent for real GDP growth in FY2022-23, YOY basis, declining from 7.5 per cent obtained in March 2022. 23. Continued growth momentum in Q4:FY2021-22, and the positive trends in the broader indicators of economic activities in the first one or two months of Q1:FY2022- 23 suggest that demand conditions are supportive of economic growth in the face of the cost push inflationary pressures that have developed. The projected headline inflation rate for FY2022-23, YOY basis, has now been 24. revised upwards to 6.7 per cent from 5.7 per cent projected in the April meeting. One of the factors that has led to the upward revision is the increase in average crude oil price for the year also affecting trade balance. The projected quarterly headline inflation rates in FY2022-23 are provided in the MPC resolution for June 2022. Besides the petroleum prices, headline inflation is also significantly affected by food inflation. For the major food commodities, a normal rainfall would moderate the prices, although the international supply conditions for food commodities would be a factor that would affect the course of food price inflation. 25. In sum, the inflationary pressures that have intensified since March 2022 are expected to remain a concern in FY2022-23 unless the international supply conditions improve quickly. Changing the course of inflation trajectory to reach targeted level is a priority at this stage for monetary policy although the growth momentum remains modest one. Monetary policy tightening has begun in a number of economies globally to rein in inflationary pressures. Fiscal measures to contain the impact of international price spikes to the domestic consumer and measures to improve supply expansion would moderate price pressures. The RBI moved to streamline the LAF corridor in April 2022, with SDF as the floor and restoring the width of the corridor at the pre-pandemic level. The MPC raised the policy Repo rate by 40 basis points in its meeting held in May and RBI also announced an increase in CRR by 50 basis points. In view of the elevated levels of inflation rates which may persist given the disruptions international supply chains are experiencing, there is a need to ensure that policy rates are consistent with the requirements of moderating inflation expectations and liquidity conditions are consistent with the requirements of economic growth in an environment less constrained by the COVID pandemic. While the impact of these measures is likely to have some adverse impact on aggregate demand in the short term, moderating inflation pressures now is crucial to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment. 26. Accordingly, I vote to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90 per cent. I also vote to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 27. There is worry about US inflation generalizing to the rest of the world, but we must remember Indian inflation differs. We did have much higher inflation than the US but that was in the past. The danger is Indian inflation is more susceptible to crude oil and food inflation triggered by the Ukraine war. Inflation is becoming broad- based but that is because rising transport and communication costs affect almost every product. But cost pass through is one-time. True second round effects require wages to rise. And since in India the majority still lives in rural areas, rural wages must rise. In India\u2019s high inflation episode over 2007-2011 real rural wage growth became sharply positive. A rise in raw material input prices raises food prices but input prices do not rise again because food prices have risen. But if a rise in rural wages raises food prices, the later raises wages further. 28. There are a number of links in the chain from wages to prices. Wages rise with expected inflation and the tightness of the labour market. In India they are especially sensitive to food inflation. But the continuation of the free food programme blunts the sensitivity of rural wages to food prices. Moreover, the rise in minimum support prices is moderate. Other special factors that were relevant in 2011 are not active now1. 29. The second big difference today is that we are in an inflation targeting regime. To the extent price expectations are anchored they will not raise wages. In a country with volatile inflation and thin news sources a lot of attention is paid to central bank communication. The inflation target can get internalized faster. In every country household inflation expectations exceed actual inflation but the impact of hierarchy shows up in extreme sensitivity to government action. Both times petrol and diesel excise was cut there was a steep fall in household inflation expectations. Countercyclical taxes may not raise the fiscal deficit because of buoyancy of taxes under high nominal output growth. Third, if the labour market is not tight there would not be much impact of 30. wages on prices despite expected inflation. Rising employment does not put pressure on wages, if there are many willing to work without higher wages. We know unemployment is high in India, especially for youth. Many are looking to shift to more productive jobs. Wages are rising in sectors like information technology where there is a shortage of skills, but it is not yet a general phenomenon. Contrast this with the US where acute shortages are pushing up wages. During the pandemic many firms have economized on labour cost and the share of wages has gone down. Moreover, the aggregate supply curve is estimated to be flat so that prices do not rise much even if employment rises. Fourth, firms set prices as a mark-up on wages and other costs. But if demand 31. is slack, they tend to reduce mark-ups or make other adjustments rather than pass on rising input prices to consumers. Corporate surveys show that input price indices have risen more than output price indices and yet mark-ups have remained constant. It is wage share that has fallen. This is the classic low demand response. India did not have excess stimulus like in the US, and excess demand is not adding to inflation pressures here. Fifth, credit growth is moderate and has just reached double digits. Excess 32. durable liquidity cannot create inflation if broad money supply growth is low and asset prices are falling because of foreign outflows. A key figure to note is that broad money growth at 8.8% was much lower than nominal income growth. Financial conditions are not loose. 33. Finally, since inflation largely stayed within the target band in the Covid-19 period the real interest rate was around -2%, compared to -6% in the US. Deviation from equilibrium real rates and the persistent distortions they can create were not large. 34. Global growth is wavering with the continuing Ukraine war and problems in China. Inflation and widespread monetary tightening are further threats to it. 35. Indian growth, however, seems quite resilient to these shocks as yet. The digital boom and supply chain diversification led export demand may outlast softening of global growth. There is pent-up demand for services, despite Covid-19 resurfacing, but it may not sustain. Other consumption is still soft. Investment is yet to take off broadly. However, an important difference policy has to keep in mind is that today the country is coming out of a pandemic-induced slump. In 2011 it was coming out of a boom with clear signs of over-heating. So policy also has to pay attention to the recovery. 36. RBI inflation projection for CPI headline in 2022-23 is 6.7% (up from 5.7% in the April policy), but the Q4 figure is expected to soften to 5.8%. Firms\u2019 price expectations from the IIM Ahmedabad survey also show some slight moderation with one year ahead expectations at less than 6%. RBI surveys show cost pressures are expected to ease in the second half of the year. There are some signs of softening in prices of global commodities apart from crude oil. 37. At the current stage of recovery, however, the one-year ahead real rate must not be more negative than -1%. A fifty or sixty basis point hike would achieve this, while looking through part of the spike in 2022 even as further supply-side movement and clarity on global developments are awaited. Such a real interest rate, while not dampening the recovery much, will prevent a possibly inflationary further rise in demand and unsustainable current account deficit. Markets benefit from recovery and so are better able to absorb rate hikes that are in step with the latter. 38. Given the above considerations I vote for a 50 bps rise in the repo rate. Further changes will depend on growth and inflation outcomes. Since future moves will either be a pause or a rise it is also useful to change the guidance to withdrawal of accommodation. focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. While the real repo rate is a useful guide to actions, and has theoretical clarity, it is difficult to estimate the neutral rate precisely. The stance therefore can be more clearly defined in terms of action on liquidity, which started in 2021. I 39. Under the external benchmark system, as it works currently, banks may not need to raise deposit rates commensurately until excess liquidity is sufficiently absorbed so that they have to borrow at the repo. If excess liquidity persists, yet policy rates rise, the ECB multi-tier excess reserve system2 is an option. Higher rates paid on a part of reserves held at the central bank could be conditional on banks passing on a share of this to depositors. 40. In my statement during the May meeting, I called for more than 100 basis points of rate increases to be carried out very soon. Taking into account the 40 basis points hike in May, my preference would have been for an increase of 60 basis points in this meeting. However, I have decided to go along with the majority view of 50 basis points for the same reason as in May: a difference of opinion of 10 basis points is not material enough to be elevated to a dissent. Hence, I vote in favour of raising the policy repo rate to 4.90%. 41. I stated in May that the MPC has a lot of catching up to do, and that remains true today. Between April and now, the MPC has raised the policy rate by 90 basis points, but during the same period the RBI\u2019s projection of inflation for the year 2022- 23 has risen by 100 basis points from 5.7% to 6.7%. The real policy rate, therefore, remains more or less where it was in April. This reminds me of Lewis Carroll\u2019s adage that we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place, and to go anywhere we must run even faster. Clearly, more needs to be done in future meetings to bring the real policy rate to a modestly positive level consistent with the emerging inflation and growth dynamics. 42. I am therefore happy that the second resolution is clearer than the May resolution that I had described then as pedantically correct but falling short in resolution no communicative efficacy. The remaining accommodative, and confines focused on withdrawal of itself accommodation. I therefore vote in favour of this resolution. longer 43. It appears to me however that as the MPC navigates this process of withdrawal, there is merit in signalling the likely pace of this tightening in more quantitative terms. Many leading central banks currently provide forecasts of the future path of the policy rate several quarters ahead. The MPC has now accumulated several years of experience, and the RBI has evolved into a mature inflation targeting central bank. I believe that the time is therefore ripe for MPC members to start moving towards providing projections of the future path of the policy rate. This would help stabilize long term bond markets and also anchor inflation expectations. Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan 44. The ongoing war in Europe and the consequent sanctions have taken a heavy toll on the global economy by aggravating supply chain disruptions and heightening uncertainty about the post-pandemic recovery. With inflation scaling multi-decadal peaks across several countries and remaining stubborn, risks of long-term inflation expectations getting unhinged have increased manifold leaving monetary authorities with little room to manoeuvre. Several Asian economies, who abstained from policy tightening last year despite mounting inflation pressures, have joined the bandwagon of their advanced economy counterparts in the battle against inflation. The pace and extent of tightening, however, are tailored to country-specific macroeconomic developments and requirements. 45. In the Indian context, domestic economic activity is progressing on the expected trajectory in 2022-23 so far as evident from the available high-frequency indicators (HFIs) during April-May 2022. Notably, 51 HFIs out of more than 70 that are monitored to track real economic activity (both from demand and supply side) have crossed their pre-pandemic (2019-20) levels. While 37 HFIs have exceeded their pre-pandemic levels by more than 10 per cent, 30 HFIs have surpassed it by over 20 per cent. Overall, growth drivers seem to be holding up despite higher inflation and tightening monetary conditions. 46. The surge in inflation by 84 basis points in April to 7.8 per cent was accompanied by broad-based momentum effects (month-on-month price increase) covering food, fuel and core categories. Six out of 12 food sub-groups and 8 out of 10 groups/sub-groups in core registered a pick-up in inflation. Overall, around 78 per cent of the CPI basket recorded a rise in inflation in April. CPI diffusion indices \u2013 for positive price increases and those for price increases at or above a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of 6 per cent \u2013 edged up sharply in April, indicating widening price pressures. Reflecting these, all core inflation measures \u2013 exclusion- based and trimmed mean measures \u2013 exceeded 6 per cent in April and were in the range of 6.4 per cent to 7.5 per cent. The weighted median (inflation relating to the 50th percentile by weight) also increased further by 40 bps to 6.5 per cent in April. 47. Given the severity and extent of generalisation of inflation as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, average CPI inflation during 2022-23 is now projected at 6.7 per cent, an increase of one percentage point (100 bps) from 5.7 per cent indicated in the April 2022 policy. About three-fourths of the revision in inflation projections is on account of food as adverse global price spillovers are expected to be more than transient. Even though aggregate demand conditions have remained subdued during the past few years, repeated supply shocks seem to be primarily leading to higher inflation gap persistence3 causing inflation to remain at elevated levels above the target. Such large and persistent supply shocks have the potential to un-anchor inflation expectations. 48. With protracted geopolitical tensions and no early resolution of the conflict in sight, considerable uncertainty clouds the evolving inflation trajectory. While the supply side measures taken by the government would undeniably alleviate some cost-push pressures, it needs to be complemented by calibrated monetary policy actions to anchor inflation expectations and contain the broadening price pressures. Given inflation expectations in India are largely adaptive or backward looking, persistent supply disruptions and the resulting price pressures could get entrenched in higher inflation expectations. Since the short-term trade-off between inflation and output worsens under high inflation expectations (the upward shift of the Phillips curve), this would call for front-loaded policy action to rein in inflation expectations. It is worthwhile to note that central bank credibility plays an important role in minimising the sacrifice ratio \u2013 the loss of growth due to policy tightening. Thus, more than the direct impact, it is the second-round effects that central banks seek to address through the anchoring of long-run inflation expectations which, in turn, can deliver low and stable inflation over the medium-term. In view of the above and given the MPC\u2019s projection that inflation is likely to 49. remain above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through the first three quarters of 2022-23 with persistent shocks to food inflation sustaining pressures on the headline, I vote for a 50 basis points increase in the policy repo rate. I also vote for withdrawal of accommodation to align inflation with the target going forward, while remaining growth supportive. On the MPC\u2019s decision of rephrasing the stance by abjuring the words \u201cto remain accommodative\u201d and focusing on withdrawal of accommodation, it is consistent with the recent monetary policy actions to withdraw the extraordinary pandemic measures-infused liquidity. The measures taken so far have ensured that liquidity conditions evolve in alignment with the monetary policy stance and liquidity overhang does not pose additional risks to inflation. 50. While frontloading policy measures, one needs to be aware that the pace of policy transmission has quickened after the introduction of the external benchmark- based lending rates (EBLR) in October 2019. With more than 40 per cent of the total floating rate outstanding loans linked to external benchmarks, the degree of pass- through to actual lending rates has increased and this would strengthen monetary transmission in the current cycle. The inherent framework of the EBLR regime which enables quicker and larger transmission to lending rates coupled with banks\u2019 propensity to pass-through policy rate changes to lending rates rather quickly, particularly during tightening cycles, may have to be factored to achieve the desired outcome during the current tightening phase. Of course, the trajectory of inflation going ahead will be an important determining factor. 51. More importantly, when the monetary-fiscal coordination is at its best, fighting inflation becomes a joint responsibility which is crucial for engineering a successful disinflation. In this context, with monetary policy prioritising price stability and fiscal policy emphasising on quality of expenditure through capex, the economy becomes the net beneficiary. Thus, it may be important for the government \u2013 both centre and states \u2013 to successfully complete their budgeted capex plans and work through their 3 Inflation gap persistence (Cogley et al., 2010) is measured by the time varying persistence in the deviation of inflation from its long-term trend. Recent estimates with Indian inflation data suggest that it increased from 0.10 to 0.30. Ref: Cogley, T., Primiceri, G. E., & Sargent, T. J. (2010). Inflation-gap persistence in the US. American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, 2(1), 43-69. counter-cyclical policy levers to ensure a soft-landing for the economy amidst monetary tightening to rein in inflation. 52. \u201cGlobalisation is finished\u201d seems to be the theme of discussions in business and financial fora the world over. Geopolitics has become front and centre of all investment decisions. Near shoring, on shoring and reshoring echo through investor conferences, adding to the influential call for friend shoring or relocation of supply chains to friendly countries. The age of globalisation based on outsourcing is over. Decades of productivity gains from opening up are being reversed and this is showing up in inflation. 53. Terms that are being used to describe the global outlook are now being drawn from extreme weather conditions. Bond yields and consumer surveys are flashing red. Google searches for \u201crecession\u201d are soaring. In fact, the narrative is shifting from whether there will be a recession to what will be the shape of the recession as monetary policy goes on to the front foot. 54. With inflation at multi-decadal highs across advanced economies and emerging and developing economies, the inflation crisis is global. In response, the most widespread monetary policy tightening in decades is underway. It is the most coordinated tightening cycle in many years, and the actions are appearing synchronised because imported inflation pressures are being exacerbated by country-specific factors acting at the same time. Yet, for monetary policy, rather than materially compressing demand, managing expectations is the key. 55. The global inflation crisis is just the face of one of the most severe food and energy crises in recent history that now threatens the most vulnerable across the globe. Across the developing world, food shortages will likely last through this year and the early part of next year, exacerbating the pain of soaring food prices. Even in the world\u2019s richest nations, higher food prices are causing food poverty for the first time in a generation. 56. At the receiving end are emerging market equities and bonds. In terms of widely used indices, emerging market bonds are suffering their worst losses in three decades, hit by rising global interest rates. Surges of volatility in the foreign exchange markets have become a function of supply chain pressures, soaring shipping costs and the position of the host country on the path of monetary policy normalisation. India is being impacted by the global inflation crisis as recent outcomes have 57. shown. Two thirds of the change in the CPI since the war is reflecting the materialising of geopolitical risk. Although the ongoing inflation surge is a supply phenomenon everywhere, mending supply always takes time. Admirable efforts have been made in this direction at the cost of strains on fiscal discipline, demonstrating that price stability is a shared responsibility \u2013 the government sets the inflation target and the central bank implements it. To gain time for supply to respond, the blunt instrument of monetary policy has 58. to be deployed \u2013 there is no other recourse at this juncture. What will monetary policy do? The fact that inflation remains elevated and is broadening indicates that there is some demand that is able to afford these high prices, perhaps due to revenge spending in a pandemic stressed response. In fact, core core inflation \u2013 the most sluggish part of the index \u2013 CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver (44 per cent versus 47 per cent of the CPI in the standard core) \u2013 and the weighted median are both showing generalisation and momentum. High frequency indicators for May point to expansion in demand. This warrants some monetary policy front load to modulate it so that even though it is not at full strength, it does not exceed the available supply. In the process, spending will slow down, so will demand and so will the economy. The objective should be to take the repo rate to a height that is at least above the four quarters ahead forecast of inflation, knowing that monetary policy works with lags. Concomitantly, it is important to condition public perceptions and expectations that growth will be closer to 6 per cent than to 7 per cent in 2023-24 as a result of monetary tightening. 59. If this inflation is allowed to go out of hand, it could (i) corrode the foundations of the recovery that is gradually gaining traction \u2013 empirical evidence shows that inflation above 6 per cent in India is unambiguously harmful for growth; (ii) deter investment decisions because businesses will worry about demand for their products getting postponed at these elevated levels of prices; (iii) cause depositors to worry about negative returns to their deposits and hence shift to time tested holders of value like gold which translates to capital flight in the case of India \u2013 the world\u2019s second largest importer of the yellow metal produces only 1 per cent of consumption domestically; (v) cause exchange rate depreciation which will increase imported inflation, discourage capital inflows and trigger large capital outflows. 60. So, the die is cast. On one side are the nihilists \u2013 they lick their lips and obsess that the RBI, like a lamb to the slaughter, is about to fail in its monetary policy mandate. They fail to differentiate between a procedural issue and sensationalism. 61. The accountability mechanism enhances credibility in the monetary policy framework and that is of paramount importance. The wide public sensitivity to accountability works in the same direction as monetary policy in the pursuit of ensuring price stability. It shows that inflation expectations are anchored around the conviction that monetary policy will not tolerate persistent deviations from target because it is enjoined by legislation (not) to do so. On the other side are the facts, the immutables, which suggest that inflation may be peaking. In June, the excise duty cuts on petrol and diesel will have kicked in strongly and knocked off 20 bps from headline inflation. After that second order effects will take effect. Other measures will work like second order effects to soften core inflation at the margin. As monetary policy works through its lags, demand will inevitably get restrained and become compressed to the level of supply. Inflation will fall back to below 6 per cent by the fourth quarter of 2022-23. In 2023-24, it should moderate to 4 per cent. This is the most pragmatic result that can be hoped for under the prevailing extraordinary circumstances. 62. Headline inflation levels will remain high across the world for some time; hence, the thing to watch is the direction of inflation, not its level, which will remain elevated for some time in view of the overwhelming shocks. If headline inflation starts moving down in the second half of the year, the objective of taking the policy rate above the level of future inflation will be achieved sooner than later, providing space to pause and reconfigure. 63. If the early arrival of the monsoon and the removal of the ban on edible oil exports by Indonesia foretell of a more benign outlook on food prices than currently envisaged, India would have tamed the inflation crisis even earlier and decoupled from the rest of the world. Without a doubt, the impact of the war in the form of generalising price pressures will cause a very grudging decline in inflation and a possible breach of the accountability criteria. The battle would be lost but the war would have been won if India is able to bend down the future trajectory of inflation. This is attributable no less to the supply side measures undertaken by the Government; the tightening of the LAF corridor and introduction of the standing deposit facility in April 2022 as its floor at a rate 40 basis points higher than the fixed rate reverse repo; the 40 basis points raising of the policy rate in May along with the 50 basis points increase in the cash reserve ratio requirement; and the proposed increase in the policy repo rate in today\u2019s meeting. 64. To reiterate, given the extraordinary circumstances driving up inflation the world over, our endeavour should be to bring down inflation into the tolerance band by the last quarter of 2022-23 or the first quarter of 2023-24 and progressively align it to the target during the course of 2023-24. This should minimise the loss of output. If real GDP growth averages between 6-7 percent of GDP in 2022-23 and 2023-24, the recovery that is increasingly solidifying gets a fair chance of reaching the sunlight. If all that happens, the RBI will have fulfilled its mandate of prioritising price 65. stability while being mindful of growth. 66. Accordingly, I vote to raise the policy repo rate by 50 basis points and to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 67. The war in Europe is lingering. The end of war and sanctions are nowhere in sight. The uncertainty continues. Global growth and trade are steadily decelerating, global commodity prices remain firm and financial markets worldwide are turning more volatile. Monetary policy normalisation has become the order of the day across most central banks. The war has globalised inflationary pressures across geographies, and there are increasing risks of long-term inflation expectations getting unanchored. While prices of a few commodities \u2013 such as metals and fertilisers \u2013 have seen some softening, most food and all energy prices remain elevated. 68. Against this background, the domestic CPI inflation for April 2022 surged to 7.8 per cent \u2013 the fourth consecutive month of inflation being above the upper tolerance level of 6.0 per cent. Adverse spillovers from high global commodity prices continue to impinge on domestic prices in April and thereafter. Domestic factors also played a role, with a strong heat wave and consequent loss of production resulting in significant pick-up in prices of several food items. According to our latest assessment, the average annual inflation in the current year (2022-23) is expected to be 6.7 per cent, with the first three quarters remaining above six per cent. 69. Growth impulses, on the other hand, are broadly evolving in line with expectations as borne out by the available high-frequency indicators during April-May 2022. The forecast of a normal southwest monsoon, the improvement in employment conditions as reflected in the rates of labour force participation (LFP) and employment, the early results from RBI surveys indicating steady rise in capacity utilisation and improving non-food credit growth augur well for the growth outlook. Together, these developments can be expected to support private consumption and investment. Net household financial savings (HFS) in 2021-22, although moderating from the preceding year, remained above pre-pandemic levels and along with healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, can support private consumption and investment. Merchandise exports clocked double-digit growth for the fifteenth successive month in May 2022, despite heightened global uncertainty. In the wake of all these developments, the projection of growth for 2022-23 has been retained at 7.2 per cent, the same as in the April MPC resolution. 70. Thus, while high inflation continues to be the major concern, revival of economic activity remains steady and is gaining traction. The time is appropriate to go for a further increase in the policy rate to effectively deal with inflation and inflation expectations. Accordingly, I vote for a 50 bps increase in the repo rate which would be in line with the evolving inflation-growth dynamics and will help in mitigating the second round effects of adverse supply shocks. This action will reinforce our 71. I also vote for a change in the stance to provide greater clarity on our policy intent by focussing wholly on withdrawal of accommodation. It is important in this context to note that the repo rate is still below the pre-pandemic level and the liquidity surplus is still higher than what it was prior to the pandemic. As our policy in recent months has been unambiguously focussed on withdrawal of accommodation, both in terms of liquidity and rates, the change in wording of stance should be seen as a recent approach. The withdrawal of continuation and accommodation, as I see it, would be non-disruptive to the process of recovery and would strengthen our ongoing efforts to combat inflation and anchor inflation expectations. fine-tuning of our ", "file_8": "\u0938\u0902\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u093f\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\ufffd\ufffd\u0940\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u090f\u0938.\u092c\u0940.\u090f\u0938. \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941 Department of Communication, Central Office, S.B.S.

Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the 3. Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (August 5, 2022) decided to: Increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 5.15 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.65 per cent. The MPC also decided to The MPC also decided to focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting in June 2022, the global economic and financial environment has deteriorated with the combined impact of monetary policy tightening across the world and the persisting war in Europe heightening risks of recession. Gripped by risk aversion, global financial markets have experienced surges of volatility and large sell-offs. The US dollar index soared to a two-decade high in July. Both advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) witnessed weakening of their currencies against the US dollar. EMEs are experiencing capital outflows and reserve losses which are exacerbating risks to their growth and financial stability. Domestic economic activity remains resilient. As on August 4, 2022, the south- 7. west monsoon rainfall was 6 per cent above the long period average (LPA). Kharif sowing is picking up. High frequency indicators of activity in the industrial and services sectors are holding up. Urban demand is strengthening while rural demand is gradually catching up. Merchandise exports recorded a growth of 24.5 per cent during April-June 2022, with some moderation in July. Non-oil non-gold imports were robust, indicating strengthening domestic demand. CPI inflation eased to 7.0 per cent (year-on-year, y-o-y) during May-June 2022 8. from 7.8 per cent in April, although it persists above the upper tolerance band. Food inflation has registered some moderation, especially with the softening of edible oil prices, and deepening deflation in pulses and eggs. Fuel inflation moved back to double digits in June primarily due to the rise in LPG and kerosene prices. While core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) moderated in May-June due to the full direct impact of the cut in excise duties on petrol and diesel pump prices, effected on May 22, 2022, it remains at elevated levels. 9. Overall system liquidity continues in surplus, with average daily absorption under the LAF at \u20b93.8 lakh crore during June-July. Money supply (M3) and bank credit from commercial banks rose (y-o-y) by 7.9 per cent and 14.0 per cent, respectively, as on July 15, 2022. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 573.9 billion as on July 29, 2022. 10. Spillovers from geopolitical shocks are imparting considerable uncertainty to the inflation trajectory. More recently, food and metal prices have come off their peaks. International crude oil prices have eased in recent weeks but remain elevated and volatile on supply concerns even as the global demand outlook is weakening. The appreciation of the US dollar can feed into imported inflation pressures. Rising kharif sowing augurs well for the domestic food price outlook. The shortfall in paddy sowing, however, needs to be watched closely, although stocks of rice are well above the buffer norms. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys expect input cost pressures to soften across sectors in H2. Cost pressures are, however, expected to get increasingly transmitted to output prices across manufacturing and services sectors. Taking into account these factors and on the assumption of a normal monsoon in 2022 and average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 105 per barrel, the inflation projection is retained at 6.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q2 at 7.1 per cent; Q3 at 6.4 per cent; and Q4 at 5.8 per cent, and risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2023-24 is projected at 5.0 per cent (Chart 1). 11. On the outlook for growth, rural consumption is expected to benefit from the brightening agricultural prospects. The demand for contact-intensive services and the improvement in business and consumer sentiment should bolster discretionary spending and urban consumption. Investment activity is expected to get support from the government\u2019s capex push, improving bank credit and rising capacity utilisation. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expect sequential expansion in production volumes and new orders in Q2:2022-23, which is likely to sustain through Q4. On the other hand, elevated risks emanating from protracted geopolitical tensions, the upsurge in global financial market volatility and tightening global financial conditions continue to weigh heavily on the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, the real GDP growth projection for 2022-23 is retained at 7.2 per cent, with Q1 at 16.2 per cent; Q2 at 6.2 per cent; Q3 at 4.1 per cent; and Q4 at 4.0 per cent, and risks broadly balanced. Real GDP growth for Q1:2023-24 is projected at 6.7 per cent (Chart 2). 12. Headline inflation has recently flattened and the supply outlook is improving, helped by some easing of global supply constraints. The MPC, however, noted that inflation is projected to remain above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through the first three quarters of 2022-23, entailing the risk of destabilising inflation expectations and triggering second round effects. Given the elevated level of inflation and resilience in domestic economic activity, the MPC took the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is needed to contain inflationary pressures, pull back headline inflation within the tolerance band closer to the target, and keep inflation expectations anchored so as to ensure that growth is sustained. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 13. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent. 14.

The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during September 28-30, 2022. Voting on the Resolution to increase the policy repo rate to 5.40 per cent 17. The sharp increase in inflation rate in March 2022, following two successive months of CPI inflation rate of 6 per cent or above, changed the policy perspectives on inflation. The developments in March caused by the Russia-Ukraine war imparted much uncertainty to global supplies of fuel, food and trade in general. The rise in global energy prices had clear impact on the domestic prices. In May policy rate was increased by MPC, which was followed up in June. Although the risks of Covid 19 pandemic remained, there were signs of strengthening economic activities as both supply and demand conditions improved in many of the sectors. Bringing inflation rate closer to the target was important to sustain the economic growth momentum over the medium term. The headline consumer inflation rate for Q1: FY 2022-23 is at 7.3 per cent, 18. although lower than the level projected in the June MPC meeting. At 7.3 per cent, it is also higher than any of the previous four quarters of 2021-22. The moderation seen in the headline inflation rate in May and June, from 7.8 per cent in April to 7.0 per cent was mainly on account of the decline in food inflation and inflation in the category of items excluding food and fuel & light. But in each of the three major components of the headline, the year-on-year (YOY) inflation rate remained at or above 6 per cent in June, highlighting the continued broad-based inflationary pressures. 19. Reduction in the excise duty on petrol and diesel by the central government and some of state governments towards the end of May helped ease price pressures for the transport sector. Withdrawal of Indonesia\u2019s ban on palm oil exports by the end of May 2022 helped ease price pressures on food inflation. 20. The commodity prices in the international markets, including metals and crude oil, softened from the highs that prevailed when the Russia-Ukraine war broke out. The softening of the international crude oil prices appears to be a consequence of expected slowing down of global growth as monetary policies across countries tightened to rein in inflationary pressures. Slowing down of Chinese economy has also been a factor in the emerging global weak demand conditions as Covid 19 continues to cast a shadow on economic activities there. 21. These have been the positive developments as far as inflation scenario is concerned. However, uncertainty on inflation pressures in the global environment remains significant. Prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict and disruptions in supplies, especially for energy and food commodities are a major source of uncertainty for price trends. The direct impact of supply disruptions, even if targeted to some geographies, is quickly transmitted elsewhere to meet the overall demand supply imbalances. Weakening of many currencies against the US dollar also imparts inflationary pressures on the domestic economies of the other countries. 22. On the domestic front, inflationary pressures exerted by the rising input prices are continuing. The impact of recent changes to GST rates, somewhat uneven distribution of the southwest monsoon rainfall with deficiency in the eastern region of the country, could be source of upward pressure on prices. The Enterprise Surveys conducted by the RBI in May-June 2022 find that majority of the firms in all the major sectors of the economy, manufacturing, services and infrastructure, expect the cost pressures to continue through the current financial year. As a consequence, product prices are also expected to increase. The bimonthly survey of consumers conducted in the first fortnight of July also points to the widely shared perception of the prevailing high rate of inflation one-year ahead, although the percentage of respondents who expect the rate to decline has increased compared to the previous survey in May 2022. The RBI Survey of Inflation Expectations of Households also conducted in the first fortnight of July shows that the 3 months ahead and one year ahead median expected inflation rates have declined from the expectations held in May. However, by a qualitative measure, the percentage of respondents expecting a decline in inflation rate 3 months ahead or one year ahead is far below the percentages who expect the rate to increase or stay similar. These sample survey results show some signs of expectations of decline in future inflation rates but the optimism is guarded. The RBI Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in the second fortnight of July 2022 projects a CPI inflation rate of 6 per cent or above in the remaining three quarters of FY 2022-23. The present pattern of trends and assessments suggest a gradual decline in 23. inflation rate during FY 2022-23 but still above the upper level of the tolerance band around the target of 4 per cent. Going forward, the food inflation scenario would be affected by the overall rainfall conditions in the remaining period of the present monsoon and the crop prospects, besides the global price conditions. The easing of global prices in the case of energy and other raw materials may soften the prices in the non-food sectors although there may still be pressures from the incomplete pass through of the higher input prices that prevailed. The upside risks to any declining inflation trajectory in the short term are significant. Taking into account these trends, for FY 2022-23, the headline CPI inflation rates have been projected at 7.1 per cent for Q2, 6.4 per cent for Q3 and 5.8 per cent in Q4. The projected inflation rate for FY 2022-23 is at 6.7 per cent, the same as in the June MPC meeting. 24. The global economic conditions have turned unfavourable for growth from the combined shocks of the breakout of the Russia-Ukraine war, continued shadow of Covid 19 across countries and the tightening of monetary policies to rein in inflation in many countries. The revised projections by the International Monetary Fund for 2022, released in July, place world GDP growth at 3.2 per cent, sharp drop from 4.4 per cent projected in January 2022 and 3.6 per cent in April 2022. The world trade volume of goods and services is now projected to grow by 4.1 per cent in 2022 over the previous year, a decline from 6 per cent projected in January and 5 per cent in April 2022. Deceleration in growth, particularly in the major economies of the world would have an adverse impact on their imports. The spill over effects on imports of other countries are also adverse. The monetary policy tightening in the advanced economies has also led to capital outflow from the emerging economies, including India. The elevated levels of crude oil prices and the rising prices of natural gas in the international markets has meant rising import costs raising trade deficit. 25. The worsening global economic conditions have come at a time for us when the domestic economy was beginning to sustain its growth momentum after regaining the output level in 2021-22 from the shocks of the Covid 19 pandemic. Performance of a number of sectors showed sustained growth in Q1: FY 2022-23, particularly in manufacturing. Although IIP for April-May 2022 was only 4.0 per cent above the same period in 2019, it was 12.9 per cent YOY basis. The PMI for manufacturing has remained in the expansion zone for April-June and rose further in July. In the case of services also, PMI rose from April to June but fell in July. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing rose above the long-term average in Q4: 2021-22 and the RBI Industrial Outlook Survey reflects expectations of steady improvement through Q4: 2022-23. Although there are concerns over demand conditions in the case of services and infrastructure sectors in H1, improvement in conditions is expected in H2: FY 2022-23. 26. On the demand side, the RBI Survey of Consumer Confidence conducted in the first fortnight of July reflects continued caution by the consumers on non-essential spending. One year ahead from now, only about 30 per cent of the respondents expect to increase non-essential spending. The import of capital goods during January-June 2022 in terms of value in US$ are above the 2019, although IIP for capital goods is still below 2019 level for the same period. Export performance in both goods and services in 2021-22 was well above the 2019 levels and in Q1: FY 2022-23, exports exceeded the value, YOY basis as well. However, going forward, export performance would be affected by the global demand conditions, with strengthening dollar providing some incentive to exporters despite the higher cost of imported inputs. 27. The recent data on indicators such as GST collections, E-way bills and non- food credit indicate sustained momentum of economic activities. Although demand conditions may be restrained, the growth momentum has been sustained. Based on the overall economic activity conditions, the YOY GDP growth rate of 7.2 per cent for FY 2022-23 projected in the June 2022 MPC meeting has been retained. The CPI inflation rate is in excess of 6 per cent in Q4: FY 2021-22 and Q1: FY 28. 2022-23 and projected to be well above the target of 4 per cent in Q1: FY 2023-24. Both the GDP growth rate and inflation rate for FY 2022-23 have been retained at the same levels as in the June MPC meeting. There are significant uncertainties to both growth and inflation rates emanating from external and domestic factors. Sustaining the growth momentum will also require reduction in inflation rate. The prevailing inflation pressures, therefore, remain a concern and continued monetary policy measures are needed to ensure that the inflation rate is aligned with the target rate. 29. Accordingly, I vote to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.4 per cent. I also vote to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 30. The last three months show Indian growth sustaining despite continuing global shocks and rate rises. Indeed, India has done better than expected and in comparison to many countries under the pandemic and Ukraine war shocks. Among reasons for this are growing economic diversity that helps to absorb shocks. Large domestic demand can moderate a global slowdown; if industry suffers from lockdown, agriculture does well. Services compensate for less contact-based delivery if global growth slows, with digitization, distance work and exports. Even diversification from China, India\u2019s digital advantage and government efforts to promote exports would support Indian exports. A rise in the current very small Indian share in world exports remains feasible. Another example of the value of diverse participants comes from the financial markets. Household SIPs in stock markets have compensated for FPI outflow. Since the share of stocks in their financial assets is still low (4 per cent compared to 27 per cent for US households) there is room for this to rise further safely and give households higher returns in a better diversified portfolio. Other types of diversity in the financial sector are improving stability. 31. The repo rate rise, which is reversing the large pandemic-induced cut of 115 bps in a more calibrated fashion, has not as yet slowed the recovery. Real rates remain negative and there are lags in pass through. Even so, rising rates may have prevented over-heating. Coordinated fiscal and monetary policy action to reduce inflation while maintaining adequate demand has worked well. 32. Inflation has also moderated. FPI are returning because India has better prospects among emerging markets, and the crash in currency and stock markets that they were waiting for in order to re-enter is proving unlikely. Commodity inflation is finally softening, and is likely to continue with a global slowdown and supply-chain bottlenecks turning into gluts due to excess inventories with firms. In India there is some rise in industry wages, but corporate margins remain high. Large sales and softening of other input costs gives space to absorb moderate wage rise. Although the RBI enterprise survey shows corporates expect prices to rise, if demand falls it may moderate their ability to raise prices. Rural wage growth is flat at 4.8 per cent. Household inflation perceptions and expectations have fallen. Inflation, however, is still above the tolerance band, and shows signs of being 33. so for the first 3 quarters of 2022-23. This can be destabilizing for inflation expectations. That policy responds strongly to ensure its inflation commitments is important for the credibility of an inflation targeting regime. Some rise in GST tax rates, electricity tariffs, energy costs and rupee depreciation, although the rupee is showing signs of mean reversion towards real equilibrium values, are short-term risks for inflation. 34. Attempting a soft landing for the economy is important, however. For this, policy rates should not depart far from equilibrium. Such an outcome also balances between those who gain from a rise in rates and those who lose from it. In my last minutes I had suggested (-)1 per cent as the then lower limit for the one year ahead real repo rate. Shocks affect the steady-state natural interest rate1. Policy has to tighten against negative supply shocks as well as against positive demand shocks that raise the equilibrium rate. My research showed Indian real rates were required to be negative in slumps but low positive in booms2. The healthy recovery suggests we are no longer in a slump. Crude oil prices have fallen, but their persistence above $100, is a negative supply shock, raising the required one-year ahead real rate into positive territory. One year ahead inflation is expected to be around 5 per cent. Therefore, I vote for a 50 bps rise raising the repo rate to 5.4 per cent, and delivering the required low positive real rate. 35. Since the real rate is now near neutral, but uncertainty and global risks to both growth and inflation remain high, policy has to carefully monitor incoming data and respond to current developments. Indeed, if the US Fed does that, tapering its rate rise with signs of a slowdown, it will reduce global risks. 36. One of the first impacts of rising policy repo rates should be on credit demand as pass through raises loan rates. India is just coming out of a deleveraging cycle and recovery requires credit growth to rise. Despite rising repo rates in May and June 2022, yearly credit growth over the respective months in 2021 continues to be high partly due to the base effect. Preliminary sectoral credit data shows sharp rise in bank loans to the service sector but average of MSME, NBFC and personal bank loans over May and June was less than in April, and loans to large industry fell in June. There are pitfalls in monthly comparisons and the picture will be clearer as more data comes in. The rise in loan rates is still limited but has begun. 37. I also vote for \u2018withdrawal of accommodation\u2019 to continue since such a stance defined in terms of liquidity also indicates that durable liquidity will continue to be in surplus. This reassurance is important in a period of risk-off and possible outflows as the Fed continues its quantitative tightening. The LAF system has enough instruments to sterilize any effect on domestic liquidity. 38. India\u2019s flexible inflation targeting framework is mandated to respond only to inflation and growth. The repo rate does not respond to the exchange rate. This is market determined with India\u2019s capital flow and reserve management effectively reducing exchange rate volatility, which can be too high in emerging markets under global shocks. Research shows that inflation targeting works better in developing economies if additional instruments are available to address excess exchange rate and capital flow volatility3. India has many such instruments that can be activated if necessary. 39. Moreover, the interest differential with the US has only a minor and possibly perverse effect on capital flows. Debt liabilities in India\u2019s net international investment position include fixed income flows, as well as ECBs and institutional cross border borrowing. Of these $14bn left in 2020, and after that, even as the differential narrowed, have been steady at $100bn. A rise in Indian interest rates will not induce equity investment, which is the one that is currently volatile, to stay. In 2013 and in 2018 following the Fed rate rise aggravated the Indian slowdown. Today policy has more degrees of freedom to use. Similarly, multiple instruments are required and are available to keep the current account deficit at sustainable levels. A competitive equilibrium REER and demand-reducing positive real interest rates will also help. 1 Gal\u00ed J. and T.

Airaudo, and Felipe Zanna (2018), \u2018Inflation Targeting and Exchange Rate Management in Less Developed Countries\u2019, Journal of International Money and Finance, 81, 159-184. 40. Inflation is at unacceptably high levels, and the projected trajectory is also above target during the entire forecast horizon. Economic growth has on the other hand proved resilient in the face of an adverse global environment. In this situation, there is clearly a need for front loaded hikes in the policy rate. The choice to my mind is between 50, 60 and 75 basis points. 41. The logic of front loading argues in favour of a 75 basis point hike: it would establish the credibility of monetary policy beyond doubt, would help achieve a faster reduction in the inflation rate, and would hopefully reduce the terminal repo rate consistent with bringing inflation close to the target. Weighing against that is the fact that a 75 basis point rate hike is quite unusual (despite a few recent hikes of this magnitude globally in the recent period). In the context of market expectations of a 35-50 basis point hike, such a large hike risks being misinterpreted as a sign of panic, and could be unnecessarily disruptive. Also even with a 50 basis point hike this month, the cumulative tightening in the past few months of 140 basis points would make the real interest rate positive based on projected inflation 3-4 quarters ahead. On balance, therefore, I do not favour a 75 basis point hike at this juncture. The choice between 50 and 60 basis points is less clear cut. The latter has the 42. advantage of bringing the repo rate back to a round multiple of a quarter percent, but shares some of the disadvantage of a 75 basis point hike to a much lesser extent. As I have argued in past statements, 10 basis points is not material and I am happy to go along with the consensus of the rest of the MPC on this issue. Therefore, I vote in favour of increasing the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.40 per cent. 43. I now turn to the second resolution to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. This statement confuses more than it clarifies. Because the rate hike in this meeting takes the policy rate above the pre-pandemic level, \u201cwithdrawal of accommodation\u201d cannot the pandemic era accommodation. It can only mean withdrawal of the pre-pandemic accommodation that began with the rate cut from 6.50% to 6.25% in February 2019. A plain reading of this resolution would then be that the MPC is focused on taking the repo rate back to 6.50%. to 44. In my view, such an indication of a terminal repo rate of 6.50% is totally unwarranted in the situation that we are in. The reality is that the Ukraine war and monetary tightening in the advanced economies have led to a very serious risk of recession in the world economy. In the face of this, commodity prices have collapsed from their April peaks. Crude oil remained elevated for longer, but it too is softening even as the MPC meeting is in progress. If this trend continues, we could see significant downward adjustments to the projected inflation trajectory. Moreover, though the Indian economy has been highly resilient to geopolitical and commodity price shocks so far, the weakening of exports in July indicates that India would not be immune to growth shocks emanating from the rest of the world. In short, it is easy to imagine that a few months from now, the economic data could point to a terminal repo rate that is well below 6.50%. To focus on one thing implies paying less attention to other things, and I do not think it would be wise to say that the MPC will remain \u201cfocused\u201d on withdrawal of accommodation ignoring other considerations. 45. I have made several different suggestions to the MPC regarding alternatives to this resolution. First, in June, I suggested that individual MPC members could start moving towards providing projections of the future path of the policy rate. Since these would be projections of individual members and not of the MPC as a whole, these projections would not tie the hands of the MPC itself in any way. At the same time, they would provide guidance to the public about the thinking within the MPC. Second, at this meeting, I suggested that this resolution should simply be dropped. It is better not to give any guidance than to give confusing guidance. Unfortunately, none of these proposals found favour with the other members. 46. At the same time, I do not wish to record an outright dissent on this resolution because clearly further withdrawal of accommodation is warranted. The terminal repo rate may or may not be 6.50% but it is almost certainly well above 5.40%. So I am confining myself to expressing my reservations on this resolution. The resolution should in my view be interpreted only as stating that there is a high likelihood of further front-loaded tightening without restricting the freedom of the MPC to respond to the changing environment in a data driven manner. Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan initially perceived as the global economy which were 47. stagflationary are now increasingly surfacing to be that of an outright recession for most economies. This has fuelled a debate of hard4 versus soft landing for the global economy. Central banks are thus confronted with trade-offs which are governed by both the magnitude as well as the timing of their policy tightening. While the need to rein in inflationary pressures without numbing the growth impulses remains a priority, central banks are treading a very narrow path and they will need a well-curated policy design for a safe and soft landing. 48. Domestic inflation after reaching a peak of 7.8 per cent in April 2022 moderated to 7.0 per cent in May-June 2022. A sequential tapering of the month-on- month prices increases (momentum) along with large favourable base effects in May brought about this softening. Headline CPI price momentum eased to 0.94 per cent in May and further to 0.52 per cent in June from an elevated 1.43 per cent in April. Headline CPI on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) basis also slowed down from 12.8 per cent in April to 2.6 per cent in June. In terms of contributions, while the deceleration in headline price momentum in May was primarily on account of core (CPI excluding food and fuel), food also started to contribute to the slowdown in headline price pressures by June. The deceleration in price momentum was broad- based across items within the food group. On the other hand, the softening in core momentum was primarily influenced by the one-off petrol and diesel price declines (reflecting the full direct impact of excise duty cut). Despite some softening, various trimmed mean measures of CPI inflation5 for June were elevated, in the range of 5.7 per cent to 6.4 per cent. In spite of some softening, diffusion indices6 for core CPI items were also at elevated levels, implying that underlying price pressures remain broad based. 49. Inflation expectations of households in India, being adaptive and backward- looking and influenced mainly by price expectations of food and fuel items (which constitute almost 55 per cent of the CPI basket), moderated in the July 2022 round but remained at elevated levels. Unmooring of inflation expectations, in the context of the spike in inflation following the conflict in Europe, is the biggest risk which the 4 BIS in its monthly bulletin (July 2022) titled \u2018Hard or Soft Landing?\u2019 has referred hard landing as a situation of bringing inflation back to target but at the cost of a recession. 5 In trimmed mean measures, CPI items which are located in the tails of the inflation distribution for every month (indicating highly volatile inflation movements) are excluded. 6 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices (seasonally adjusted) have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month and aggregates them to show whether the month-on-month (m-o-m) increase overall has been expansionary or contractionary. The diffusion indices constructed are weighted averages. MPC addressed through the off-cycle meet and frontloaded rate actions so as to increase the efficacy of the actions. 50. Going forward, though the fall in international commodity prices and the progress of the monsoon provide room for optimism, there is considerable uncertainty, particularly from the spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon and its implication for kharif paddy production, the depreciation of the INR exchange rate and pending pass-through in services. Importantly, the global geo-political scenario \u2013 the source of much of the price shocks \u2013 continues to remain unsettled. 51. While WPI inflation rose sharply in line with international commodity price movements, the full pass-through of high inputs costs reflected in WPI to CPI inflation was tempered by weak pricing power due to the prevailing slack in the economy. As the slack wanes and pricing power of firms return, there is a risk that the pass- through of past increases in input costs could continue, partly offsetting the favourable impact of recent fall in global commodity prices. Crude price uncertainty persists, though the pass-through of elevated crude oil prices to retail inflation has been moderate and low in the recent period7 due to the impact of fiscal interventions, such as reduction in excise duties. Moreover, the recent depreciation of the INR exchange rate could also temper the beneficial impact of fall in commodity prices. this These could keep core CPI year. Moreover, if high cost of living conditions persists, the household inflation expectations could edge up feeding into wages in a broad-based manner and pushing up services inflation, which has been muted so far. Thus, monetary policy needs to be watchful of the evolving input cost pass-through and wage dynamics and take pre-emptive action to contain any possibility of the emergence of a wage-price spiral. levels 52. As mentioned in my minutes of June policy, we need to factor in quicker and improved monetary transmission with the introduction of the external benchmark regime in this tightening cycle while arriving at a terminal rate. In response to the interest rate cycle turning upwards, banks have swiftly increased their external benchmark linked lending rates (EBLRs) (by 90 bps) and the 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) (by 40 bps) during April-July, 2022. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans has also increased. Though pass-through is relatively lower in case of retail term deposit rates, banks have increased their bulk deposit rates significantly. As credit growth is gathering momentum, banks can be expected to further increase rates on retail deposits to fund their lending. Moreover, with upward revisions in interest rates on small savings schemes (SSSs) in accordance with the formula-based mechanism as and when it happens, pressure will increase on banks to hike interest rates on retail deposits. 53. On balance, the inflation projection for the financial year 2022-23 is retained at 6.7 per cent, with a gradual moderation in headline inflation over H2:2022-23. As per the baseline projections, inflation is likely to remain above 6 per cent till Q3:2022-23. This would require monetary policy to persevere with its exit from accommodation to ensure that frontloaded policy rate hikes dampen inflation expectations, anchor second round effects and firmly establish our commitment to price stability. The frontloading of policy actions is expected to strengthen monetary policy credibility and temper the need for aggressive rate hikes in future. Greater credibility makes disinflation less costly, helps hold down inflation once it is low (Blinder, 20008). The dividends of establishing this credibility are not just in the contemporaneous transmission into the real economy, but also in lowering the necessary terminal policy rate to achieve the inflation target in the medium run. Deft macroeconomic management has insulated the Indian economy from several shocks in the recent past thereby ensuring that recovery remains on a firm footing. Against this background, I vote for a 50 bps hike in the repo rate so as to reinforce the MPC\u2019s commitment to price stability around the target. I also vote to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 54. The global outlook becomes increasingly uncertain and tilted by downside risks. With inflation remaining elevated worldwide and a pervasive sense of guilt about the consequences of the pandemic stimulus having been underestimated9, central banks have launched into the most aggressive, front loaded and synchronous monetary policy tightening in decades. Consequently, the probability of a recession or hard landing has risen to levels that preceded actual recessions in the past. 55. Each country is on its own - match the Fed or face currency depreciation, imported inflation, wider current account imbalances, capital outflows and reserve losses. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine appears to be broadening and it is unlikely to cease soon. Friend shoring has begun10. 56. The elephant in the room is the unrelenting strength of the US dollar which has risen by over 8.3 per cent since March 31, 2022 just to set up a numeraire. In India, there is a turn in the wind and financial markets are sensing it. The most recent demonstration of this shift is the strong appreciation of the Indian rupee in the relief rally that followed the fully priced in monetary policy action of the Fed in its July 2022 meeting. During the financial year 2022-23 so far (up to August 3), the Indian rupee has fallen by 3.9 per cent, 4.4 percentage points less than the MSCI advanced economy currency index and by 1.3 percentage points less than the MSCI EME currency index (5.1 per cent) against the US dollar. 57. This wedge reflects the underlying strength of India\u2019s fundamentals. For instance, inflation in India is lower than the weighted average of its major trading partners11. High frequency indicators suggest that there is some moderation in momentum in the first quarter of 2022-23 relative to the previous quarter, but the momentum is still positive in sharp contrast to the rest of the world. India\u2019s real GDP growth is tracking the RBI\u2019s projections, in spite of the downside bias imparted by the highly unsettled global environment. Portfolio investment is making its way back to India \u2013 the month of July has recorded net inflows of US $ 458 million, led by equities12. In a span of around one month since June 17, 2022, the BSE Sensex has risen by 13.6 per cent - these gains coincide with the corporate earnings season, with many companies delivering robust first quarter results. The yield on the 10-year G- sec benchmark has softened from its peak of 7.62 per cent on June 16, 2022 and is trading 30-40 basis points below. Surplus liquidity in the banking system has moderated as credit growth has surged. Interest rates in the money markets have aligned with the policy repo rate, reflecting the stance of calibrated withdrawal of accommodation. Other short-term rates have firmed up. Monetary transmission is stronger to lending rates currently, but deposit rates have commenced the catch-up. 9 \u201cI was wrong about inflation\u201d says Paul Krugman in the New York Times, July 21, 2022 10 On July 20, 2022 India joined 17 countries under the 2022 Supply Chain Ministerial Forum and issued a joint statement emphasizing transparency, diversification, supply chain security, sustainability and responsible business conduct. 11 In the 40-country REER, partner countries account for 91 per cent of India\u2019s merchandise trade, 88.4 per cent of world GDP and 86.4 per cent of world trade. In June 2022, India\u2019s inflation differential vis-\u00e0-vis these 40 countries was -0.6 per cent. 12 Some debt channels have also drawn back portfolio investment interest such as the Fully Accessible Route (FAR) which attracted US$ 229.2 million and the Voluntary Retention Route (VRR) which got US$ 48.5 million. All in all, the Indian economy is running a positive growth differential vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world. 58. Monetary policy, unseen and unsung, has played a key role in this swivel. The front-loaded and pre-emptive actions so far are already working into inflation expectations of households. Their perception of current inflation as well as their expectations three months and one year ahead have declined appreciably in the latest round of the RBI\u2019s survey. Furthermore, uncertainty around their perceptions and expectations (measured by their respective coefficients of variation) has reduced, indicative of anchoring. Consumer confidence about price pressures easing across product groups over the year ahead is rising. In a world of global food shortages and price pangs, steady procurement operations and comfortable buffer stocks are positives for the growth outlook and positives for the food inflation trajectory. Undoubtedly, a more even spatial distribution of the south west monsoon could fortify these cushions further. 59. Although inflation seems to have peaked, it is still unconscionably high. Risks to the trajectory of inflation in the form of currency depreciation, seasonal pressures and the monsoon\u2019s uneven progress could upend the moderation in momentum recently recorded. 60. Monetary policy\u2019s response to supply shocks has to be predicated on managing expectations and fortifying credibility. Empirically, it can be demonstrated that when a shock is transitory, inflation returns to equilibrium without the need for any monetary policy action if credibility is high. On the other hand, repeated supply shocks trigger second round effects through cost pushes, expectations, exchange rate and demand channels, warranting pre-emptive monetary policy action. Even with perfect credibility, monetary policy cannot look through the second-round effects of repeated supply shocks. The inflation target may be breached for a prolonged period. This could unsettle expectations and eventually get reflected in higher inflation. Higher credibility can reduce \u2013 not substitute for \u2013 the monetary policy response to second round effects of repeated supply shocks. By frontloading monetary policy actions, credibility is demonstrated by showing commitment to the inflation target. 61. Another dimension of monetary policy credibility is the timing of its response. With imperfect credibility, a delay in the monetary policy response to repeated unfavourable supply shocks leads to a further loss of credibility, unhinging of inflation expectations and eventually, higher inflation outcomes with a higher sacrifice of growth. Accordingly, it is essential to (a) assess the life of the shock and (b) react to any signs of second round effects to avoid the generalisation of inflation. 62. At the current juncture, shocks are large and recurring. Combined with the rebound in spending liberated from the pandemic, they carry the risk of un-anchoring inflation expectations. Frontloading of monetary policy actions can keep inflation expectations firmly anchored, re-align inflation with the target and reduce the medium-term growth sacrifice as it is timed into the recovery underway. Small steps over a prolonged period could allow inflation to get entrenched and inflation expectations unhinged. I vote for increasing the policy rate by 50 basis points and for the stance of 63. withdrawal of accommodation as articulated in the MPC\u2019s resolution. 64. Since the last MPC meeting in June 2022, there has been considerable slowdown in the global economy, which is now expected to grow only by 3.2 per cent in 2022 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). At the same time, global inflation has hardened further and is projected to remain elevated and persist for longer at around 6.6 per cent for advanced economies (AEs) and 9.5 per cent for emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) (IMF, July 2022). This has triggered a synchronised and aggressive monetary tightening by central banks across the world, leading to tighter global financial conditions after almost a decade of accommodative policies. 65. On the domestic front, though inflation has moderated and plateaued since its recent peak of April 2022, it remains unacceptably and uncomfortably high. The high level of inflation continues to be broad-based with 13 out of 23 CPI sub- groups/groups, comprising close to 60 per cent of the CPI basket, registering more than 6 per cent inflation in June 2022. Going forward, though there are early indications that inflation might have peaked in April, significant uncertainties remain on account of adverse global spillovers coming from simmering geopolitical tensions, volatile global commodity prices and financial markets. While the let-up in global food and industrial metals prices should lower imported inflation, the appreciation of the US dollar could offset some of the gains. Persistently elevated cost of living conditions can engender wage-price spirals, especially as firms regain pricing power. 66. Domestic growth, on the other hand, remains resilient and gives us the space to act. High-frequency indicators for Q1:2022-23 and thereafter are evolving on the expected trajectory. The southwest monsoon has picked up and is progressing well. This will boost the prospects of agriculture and help revitalisation of rural consumption. Contact-intensive services have rebounded and have been driving consumer demand and growth. Government expenditure, both of Centre and states, is expected to provide support to aggregate demand. in 67. Sustained high unanchoring of their second order effects. This necessitates appropriate monetary policy response to prevent upward drift in inflation from the target rate. I am of the view that at this juncture a 50 bps increase in the repo rate is necessary and, therefore, vote accordingly. I also vote for remaining focused on withdrawal of accommodation. 68. Our monetary and liquidity actions have been aimed at ensuring continued macroeconomic and financial stability that could set the foundation for a high growth trajectory over the medium term. We will continue with \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 approach, given the new set of challenges and very high uncertainties that we are confronted with. 69. Our actions today are tailored towards first bringing the CPI inflation within the target band and then taking it close to the target of 4.0 per cent over the medium term, while supporting growth. The sequence of our policy measures is expected to strengthen monetary policy credibility and anchor inflation expectations. Our actions would continue to be calibrated, measured and nimble depending upon the unfolding dynamics of inflation and economic activity.

Marg, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022 - 2266 0502 The thirty eighth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during September 28-30, 2022. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (September 30, 2022) decided to:  Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 5.65 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.15 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Global economic activity is weakening under the impact of the protracted conflict in Ukraine and aggressive monetary policy actions and stances across the world. As financial conditions tighten, global financial markets are experiencing surges of volatility, with sporadic sell-offs in equity and bond markets, and the US dollar strengthening to a 20-year high. Emerging market economies (EMEs) are flows, currency facing depreciations, reserve losses and financial stability risks, besides the global inflation shock. As external demand deteriorates, their macroeconomic outlook is becoming increasingly adverse. Domestic Economy Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew year-on-year (y-o-y) by 13.5 per cent 7. in Q1:2022-23. While all constituents of domestic aggregate demand expanded y-o-y and exceeded their pre-pandemic levels, the drag from net exports provided an offset. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) rose by 12.7 per cent in Q1:2022-23, with all constituents recording y-o-y growth and most notably, services. 8. Aggregate supply conditions are improving. With the south-west monsoon rainfall 7 per cent above the long period average (LPA) as on September 29 and its spatial distribution spreading to some deficit areas, kharif sowing has been catching up. Acreage was 1.7 per cent above the normal sown area as on September 23 and only 1.2 per cent below last year\u2019s coverage. The production of kharif foodgrains as per first advance estimates (FAE) was 3.9 per cent below last year\u2019s fourth advance estimates (only 0.4 per cent below last year\u2019s FAE). Activity in industry and services sectors remains in expansion, especially the latter, as reflected in purchasing managers indices (PMIs) and other high frequency indicators. The index of industrial production growth, however, slowed to 2.4 per cent (y-o-y) in July. 9. On the demand side, urban consumption is being lifted by discretionary spending ahead of the festival season and rural demand is gradually improving. Investment demand is also gaining traction, as reflected in rising imports and domestic production of capital goods, steel consumption and cement production. Merchandise exports posted a modest expansion in August. Non-oil non-gold imports remained buoyant. 10. CPI inflation rose to 7.0 per cent (y-o-y) in August 2022 from 6.7 per cent in July as food inflation moved higher, driven by prices of cereals, vegetables, pulses, spices and milk. Fuel inflation moderated with reduction in kerosene (PDS) prices, though it remained in double digits. Core CPI (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation remained sticky at heightened levels, with upside pressures across various constituent goods and services. 11. Overall system liquidity remained in surplus, with the average daily absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) easing to \u20b92.3 lakh crore during August- September (up to September 28, 2022) from \u20b93.8 lakh crore in June-July. Money supply (M3) expanded y-o-y by 8.9 per cent, with aggregate deposits of commercial banks growing by 9.5 per cent and bank credit by 16.2 per cent as on September 9, 2022. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 537.5 billion as on September 23, 2022. Outlook 12. High and protracted uncertainty surrounding the course of geopolitical conditions weighs heavily on the inflation outlook. Commodity prices, however, have softened and recession risks in advanced economies (AEs) are rising. On the domestic front, the late recovery in sowing augurs well for kharif output. The prospects for the rabi crop are buffered by comfortable reservoir levels. The risk of crop damage from excessive/unseasonal rains, however, remains. These factors have implications for the food price outlook. Elevated imported inflation pressures remain an upside risk for the future trajectory of inflation, amplified by the continuing appreciation of the US dollar. The outlook for crude oil prices is highly uncertain and tethered to geopolitical developments, with attendant concerns relating to both supply and demand. The Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys point to some easing of input cost and output price pressures across manufacturing, services and infrastructure firms; however, the pass-through of input costs to prices remains incomplete. Taking into account these factors and an average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 100 per barrel, inflation is projected at 6.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q2 at 7.1 per cent; Q3 at 6.5 per cent; and Q4 at 5.8 per cent, and risks are evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2023-24 is projected at 5.0 per cent (Chart 1). 13. On growth, the improving outlook for agriculture and allied activities and rebound in services are boosting the prospects for aggregate supply. The Government\u2019s continued thrust on capex, improvement in capacity utilisation in manufacturing and pick-up in non-food credit should sustain the expansion in industrial activity that stalled in July. The outlook for aggregate demand is positive, with rural demand catching up and urban demand expected to strengthen further with the typical upturn in the second half of the year. According to the RBI\u2019s surveys, consumer outlook remains stable and firms in manufacturing, services and infrastructure sectors are optimistic about demand conditions and sales prospects. On the other hand, headwinds from geopolitical tensions, tightening global financial conditions and the slowing external demand pose downside risks to net exports and hence to India\u2019s GDP outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2022-23 is projected at 7.0 per cent with Q2 at 6.3 per cent; Q3 at 4.6 per cent; and Q4 at 4.6 per cent, and risks broadly balanced. For Q1:2023-24, it is projected at 7.2 per cent (Chart 2). 14. In the MPC\u2019s view, inflation is likely to be above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through the first three quarters of 2022-23, with core inflation remaining high. The outlook is fraught with considerable uncertainty, given the volatile geopolitical situation, global financial market volatility and supply disruptions. Meanwhile, domestic economic activity is holding up well and is expected to be buoyant in H2:2022-23, supported by festive season demand amidst consumer and business optimism. The MPC is of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, restrain the broadening of price pressures and pre-empt second round effects. The MPC feels that this action will support medium-term growth prospects. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.90 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 15. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points. Dr. Ashima Goyal voted to increase the repo rate by 35 basis points. 16. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted against this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on October 14, 2022. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during December 5-7, 2022. Voting on the Resolution to increase the policy repo rate to 5.90 per cent 19. The global macroeconomic conditions have become adverse for growth and stability, particularly for the EMEs. While there are clear signs of slowing growth momentum in the economies across the world, inflation continues at much higher rates than the target for many countries. The uncertainty due to the Russia-Ukraine war has continued impacting the energy supplies and prices. While the COVID-19 pandemic has weakened, sporadic surges in some major countries are raising concern. Global monetary policy tightening to contain inflation pressures has increased the potential for significant global growth deceleration and volatility in financial markets. Declining export opportunities while imports remaining relatively high have added to the adverse external environment for the energy importing EMEs. 20. The CPI inflation in India, year-on-year basis, after a run of 7 per cent or more between March and June 2022, dropped to 6.7 per cent in July only to rise to 7 per cent again in August. With the exception of a few product groups, the high rate of price rise was widespread. Food & Beverages and fuel & light sub-groups of the CPI registered YOY rates above 7 per cent throughout this period from March to August, with the exception of a rate of 6.7 per cent in the case of food & beverages in July. Only in the case of housing and pan, tobacco and intoxicants, among the major categories of CPI, with a combined weight of 12.45 per cent in the CPI, the inflation rate was below 4 per cent during the period, with the exception of housing price index which rose by 4.1 per cent in August. Among the other remaining sub-categories, clothing and footwear registered inflation rate of about 9 per cent and the other remaining consumption items constituting \u2018miscellaneous\u2019 sub-category registered inflation rate of above 7 per cent in March and April followed by lower rates of 5-7 per cent in the subsequent May-August period. However, there was a decline in the month over month momentum of the overall CPI in May 2022 and it remained steady during June-August. The policy response across the world has been to tighten monetary policy. 21. This policy stance is expected to continue to achieve inflation targets. 22. Persistence of the higher rate of price increase at commodity and sectoral levels in the domestic market is on account of both the direct or spill-over effects of higher international market prices and also the domestic factors. Any decline in prices at the consumer level appears to be restrained by elevated levels of input prices although RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys indicate that the input price pressure is expected to ease in the second half of the current financial year. 23. The RBI survey of households conducted in September 2022 on price expectations indicates expectations of continued high rate of inflation, with the average expected inflation rate being higher than in the survey conducted in July 2022. Inflation rate is also expected to be higher 3-months ahead and one-year ahead compared to the prevailing situation. The expectations of future price readings appear to be affected more by the present conditions than the likely impact of the decline in the commodity prices in the international markets. The survey of enterprises (Industrial Outlook Survey) conducted by RBI in 24. September 2022 reflects some relief on selling prices in H2:FY2022-23 as the proportion of respondents who expect selling prices to rise drops compared to Q2: FY 2022-23. Although financing costs are expected to increase, other input cost pressures are expected to decline. The Wholesale Price Index, reflecting the price conditions at the producer level, has registered double digit rate of increase YOY basis in July and August. While there is a variation in the price changes across the broad range of commodities, in a few major categories of commodities, the price rise is significant. In the case of vegetables, fruits, crude petroleum, petrol, diesel, LPG and electricity, the WPI increased at double digit rates in July and August. In the case of cereals, the increase was 9.8 per cent in July and 11.8 per cent in August. The impact of decline in international market prices on domestic prices is yet to pass through to the domestic consumer prices. The rainfall in the monsoon period of June-September has exceeded the Long 25. Period Average by the last week of September although the rainfall has been deficient in parts of the eastern and north-eastern regions for much of the monsoon period. The monsoon rains in the aggregate have improved the rabi crop prospects. Food commodity prices in the consumption basket will be subject to the size of the kharif harvest in the short run. In the context of continued high inflation rate, the monetary policy rate has 26. increased between May and August 2022. While the impact of this increase is beginning to affect the lending and deposit rates of the banking sector, its main impact on inflation would be through expectations of a decline in future inflation rate and on the aggregate demand. There are of course other factors such as the slowing down of the global economy and its impact on exports and aggregate demand. At this juncture, the adverse impact on aggregate demand may be insulated by the seasonal factors such as the festival season demand and the kharif crop harvest. 27. The Q1: FY2022-23 estimates of national income by the NSO place constant prices GDP growth at 13.5 per cent over the same period in the previous year. This is lower than the RBI\u2019s projection of 16.2 per cent provided in the August meeting of the MPC. Despite the lower than the projected growth, it reflects sustained improvement in growth over the pre-pandemic output level of 2019-20 that began in Q2:FY2021- 22. Both Private Final Consumption Expenditure and Gross Fixed Capital Formation, in two major components of aggregate demand, registered sharp Q1:FY2022-23 YOY basis. In this sense, the overall growth momentum appears to have been sustained in Q1. increase 28. Given the lower estimates of GDP growth for Q1, there is uncertainty over sustaining the growth momentum needed to achieve growth of 7.2 per cent for the full year, projected in the August MPC meeting. There are also signs of weakness in demand conditions in the qualitative results of the RBI surveys of Enterprises (Industrial Outlook). The overall Consumer Confidence Index as per the Consumer Confidence Survey (urban households) shows optimism for one-year ahead expectations, albeit, prevailing conditions are seen to be pessimistic. The increase in consumption expenditure over the previous year and one-year ahead expectation is more widely shared with respect to \u2018essential expenditure\u2019 as compared to \u2018non- essential expenditure\u2019. The expectations of overall business outlook over the remaining quarters of FY 2022-23, based on the Enterprise Surveys for September 2022 reflects optimism but also divergence in sentiments in manufacturing, services and infrastructure sectors. In this context, the revised GDP growth projection for FY 2022-23 is now at 7.0 per cent compared to 7.2 per cent in August. The quarterly growth rates for the year are provided in the Resolution. 29. In sum, there are significant uncertainties over the trajectories of growth and inflation. On the growth front, the COVID-19 pandemic related supply side constraints do not appear to be significant. Improvement in private investment and consumption spending would require price stability. The CPI inflation rate has continued to be high \u2013 above/in excess of 6 per cent, from January 2022 onwards. While there are indications of decline in the momentum of price rise, sustaining this decline in momentum is crucial for achieving inflation and growth objectives. To align the inflation expectations with the policy target rate of inflation, further increase in policy rates is necessary at this juncture. 30. I vote to increase the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.9 per cent. I also vote to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. To start with global factors, major advanced economy central banks over- 31. stimulated after Covid-19 and are over-reacting to inflation now, creating excess volatility in cross border flows to emerging markets (EMs). Forward guidance, whether hawkish or dovish, is harmful in such uncertain times. Being data-based allows real sector changes to counter the effect of interest rates on markets. 32. There are two mitigating factors for India, however. First, after an initial extreme reaction, cross border flows discriminate on a country basis. As commodity prices soften with a global slowdown, some of the investors who had left India because of its vulnerability to commodity inflation will return. Second, India still retains policy space for smoothing global shocks. Domestic demand can counter falling export demand. It is important for policymakers to stay calm to moderate fear and over-reaction. Turning to the domestic situation, global commodity price softening affects 33. WPI more initially. CPI is rising because of a cereal and end monsoon food price spike. As a result household inflation expectations rose, while those of firms fluctuated around 5% according to the IIM Ahmedabad survey. Rising uncertainty shows in the increasing dispersion of household inflation expectations. But firms still see inflation at 5.5% by mid-2023. 34. While India has one of the highest year-on-year growth rates in the world there are some signs of slowing down. Quarter on quarter GDP contracted in Q1. The OECD points out that seasonally adjusted Indian quarter on quarter growth was the lowest after China and Poland. It is uncertain if domestic demand will sustain after the festival spike. RBI consumer surveys show 45% of households reported no increase in income levels compared to a year ago. 35. Although the large pandemic-time repo rate cut is reversed, we are not yet at the terminal rate. Demand reduction has to contribute, along with other measures, to lowering the current account deficit. A firm monetary policy reaction to inflation exceeding tolerance bands helps anchor expectations. The repo rate has to rise more. But should the rise be taken upfront or staggered over time? We examine the arguments for and against frontloading. 36. When behaviour is forward-looking front loading can pre-empt inflationary pressures. But if lagged effects of monetary policy are large, as in India, over- reaction can be very costly. Harmful effects become clear too late and are difficult to reverse. Gradual data-based action reduces the probability of over-reaction. Taking Indian repo rates too high imposed heavy costs in 2011, 2014 and 2018. A credit and investment slowdown was aggravated and sustained. It is necessary to go very carefully now that forward-looking real interest rates are positive. 37. The sacrifice of output from tightening is low if unemployment is low and there is excess demand. Setting rates to reduce excess demand to zero has little output cost and the need for future rate hikes are reduced. In India, however, unemployment is high. That there is no second round inflation from wage rise points to slack labour markets. Employment is just recovering from a series of global shocks and demand may be slowing. 38. High uncertainty also calls for slow steps. If demand slows anyway, less policy tightening will be required. That both inflation and growth were slightly lower than last quarter RBI projections may indicate the effect of tightening was underestimated. It is necessary to monitor the softening of commodity prices. If they slump real rates can shoot up too high as in 2014-15. 39. If inflation expectations are unanchored a large sacrifice may be called for to reverse them. But in EMs communication has more impact. Continuing supply-side action, global softening and transparent communication about these factors all help anchor inflation expectations. If the target is headline inflation with a large commodity component for which fiscal action has greater impact there is more responsibility on the government to act. The Indian government has demonstrated commitment to lowering costs of living and to improving infrastructure. 40. A BIS study1 of past country experience including 6 EMs found frontloaded actions tend to be followed by soft landings but average 45% of the policy rate rise was frontloaded in soft landings and the mean nominal rate hike was 2%. Large hikes were required in India to reverse steep pandemic-time cuts. Since that is completed, going slow now will allow policy to be agile and data-based. Extremes are always dangerous; 100% front loading can easily overshoot. Moderation is better. 41. Households tend to have a stagflationary view, so they expect inflation to rise when growth falls2. In addition, Indian households expect inflation to increase if the repo rate increases3. Excessive rate rises will not make inflation targeting credible if they are unable to lower supply-side inflation and instead raise costs as demand and investment falls. 42. Most analysts are arguing for a 50 bps rise just to preserve a spread with US policy rates. This is a fear driven over-reaction. In the mid-2000s the spread was less than 150 bps and there were large capital inflows. In the past 2 years spreads of above 300 bps have not brought in debt flows. If the terminal Fed rate is 5%, will it require we raise ours to 8%? The carry trade is not a stable source of financing. India has earned enough independence to protect itself from policy errors of other nations. In view of all these considerations, and to signal tapering of action, I vote for a 43. 35 bps rise in the repo rate. Both RBI and SPF headline forecasts for Q1 FY2023-24 are around 5%, implying the real rate will be approximately 0.75% with the repo rate at 5.75%. This is almost one, and can exceed unity if the fall in inflation is larger. This could be dangerous if growth slows. The MPC has to focus on the 6 month to one year ahead real rate, as this is the horizon where monetary policy will have its greatest impact. 44. Moreover, as banking liquidity is tightening, there will be more pass through. Over time LAF tools and forecasting of liquidity shocks should develop to the point where a neutral MPC stance implies weighted average money market rates are maintained in the middle of the LAF corridor. At present I vote to continue with the \u2018withdrawal of accommodation stance\u2019 since durable liquidity is still in surplus. This, together with adequate adjustment of short-term liquidity, is required to counter global quantitative tightening (QT) and possible outflows, as required. The very slow pace of QT compared to the large surplus created, along with selective CB interventions, may be sufficient, if we are lucky, to prevent financial instability despite the rapid coordinated global rise in policy rates. Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma 45. I wrote in my August statement that further withdrawal of accommodation is warranted beyond the rate increase in that meeting. However, I also indicated that we may be beginning to approach the terminal repo rate. My view remains largely the same today, and based on this, I think the MPC should now raise the policy rate to 6 percent and then take a pause. 46. A pause is needed after this hike because monetary policy acts with lags. It may take 3-4 quarters for the policy rate to be transmitted to the real economy, and the peak effect may take as long as 5-6 quarters. If we raise the repo rate to around 6 percent at this meeting, that would be a cumulative increase of around two percentage points in the space of just four months. Even this understates the extent of monetary tightening, because, a few months ago, money market rates were close to the reverse repo rate (65 basis points below the repo rate). Taking this into account, the full magnitude of monetary tightening would be well over 250 basis points. 47. Much of the impact of this large monetary policy action is yet to be felt in the real economy. In fact, much of the policy rate action is yet to be transmitted to even the broader spectrum of interest rates. For example, less than a third of the increase in the repo rate during April-August has been transmitted to retail bank deposit rates. Bank deposit interest rates play a critical role in stimulating savings, dampening consumption demand, and thereby mitigating inflationary pressures. We should hopefully see more of this transmission in ensuing quarters. While there has been much higher transmission from policy rates to lending rates, the transmission from lending rates to the real economy would also take time. 48. All this means that it is too early to know whether the policy action so far is sufficient or not. It may well turn out that even more monetary tightening is required, but it does make sense to wait and watch to see whether a repo rate of around 6 percent is sufficient to glide inflation back to target. If we were to continue to tighten without a reality check, we would run the risk of overshooting the repo rate needed to achieve price stability. It is true that inflation is currently well above 6 percent. However, since monetary policy acts with lags, what is relevant is the inflation forecasts 3-4 quarters ahead. Both the RBI\u2019s forecasts and the survey of professional forecasters show inflation falling to around 5 percent in the first quarter of the next financial year. Relative to this forecast, a policy rate of around 6 percent would not only be a positive real rate, but also likely above the neutral rate. 49. In my view, it is dangerous to push the policy rate well above the neutral rate in an environment where the growth outlook is very fragile. While the level of economic output has recovered to pre pandemic levels, it remains well below the pre pandemic trend line. Tightening global financial conditions and recessionary fears in advanced economies are acting as drags on the domestic economy as well. Weakening export growth means that economic growth has to be driven by domestic demand which is still not sufficiently robust. Much of the hope for economic growth rests on the possibility of a revival of private investment in response to rising capacity utilization. We should be careful to ensure that an unreasonably high real interest rate does not thwart this much needed upswing of the investment cycle. Compared to the previous meeting, the upside risks to inflation have abated with a moderation in crude oil prices and continued weakness in other commodity prices. 50. I have given careful consideration to the extensive analyst commentary suggesting that a terminal repo rate of 6.25 or 6.50 percent is appropriate. Much of this analysis is from the perspective of the balance of payments. It is true that in the past (notably in 1998 and in 2013), India has very successfully used interest rates to defend the currency. However, all these episodes were before the inception of an inflation targeting MPC in 2016. The statutory mandate restricts the MPC to consider only two factors while setting interest rates - inflation and growth. It was a conscious legislative choice to let monetary policy be dictated by domestic economic considerations, and leave the external sector to be managed using other instruments. This means that the MPC cannot be guided by the effect of global monetary tightening on the interest rate differential. 51. My votes on the MPC resolutions are informed by these considerations. For the first resolution on the quantum of the rate hike, I considered three alternative choices: 35, 50, and 60 basis points corresponding to repo rates of 5.75, 5.90 and 6.00 percent. I think that 5.75 per cent would be well below the terminal repo rate, would leave the task of monetary tightening unfinished, and make it necessary to hike rates again in the next meeting. My preference is clearly for a front loaded hike to the 6 percent level that I have argued for in the above paragraphs. The majority of the MPC has chosen 5.90 percent which is only slightly below my preferred rate of 6 percent. As I have explained in past statements, 10 basis points is not material and I am happy to go along with the majority of the MPC on this issue. Therefore, I vote in favour of increasing the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.90 percent. However, I vote against the second resolution because in my view the MPC should now pause rather than focus on further tightening. Statement by Dr. Rajiv Ranjan 52. Central banks across the globe continue their fight against inflation this year with more than a dozen central banks hiking rates by 75 bps or even more in one go. While global financial markets are witnessing the immediate brunt with associated spillovers for emerging markets including India on account of risk-off sentiment and US dollar strength, \u2018historic\u2019 global growth slowdown is the medium-term risk that the world economy has to face. 53. India is in a much better position relative to many other parts of the world. Growth is resilient, and that is also encapsulated in upgrade in growth forecasts for Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2022-23. Although exports are vulnerable to global growth slow down, it could be offset by some favourable spillovers from lower global commodity prices coupled with other factors alluded to in the following paragraphs. 54. For Q1:2022-23, National Statistical Office (NSO) estimate of real GDP growth at 13.5 per cent was lower than our projection of 16.2 per cent. Despite a strong pick up in private consumption and investment which supported aggregate demand in Q1, lower growth in government consumption and higher drag from net exports contained growth in real GDP. High growth in real imports - with lower-than-expected deflator inflation at 13.7 per cent despite sharp rise in import prices - outpaced real export growth significantly. 55. Again, growth in contact-intensive services as reflected by GVA growth in trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting also fell short of expectations. While this sector had exceeded its pre-pandemic level by 1.7 per cent in Q4:2021-22 in a quarter marred by Omicron, it slipped below its pre- pandemic level by 15.5 per cent in Q1:2022-23 which was a relatively normal quarter. Assuming this sector could have just reached its pre-pandemic level in Q1:2022-23 (i.e., at the Q1:2019-20 levels), real GVA growth would have been 16.1 per cent during the quarter. Notably, this sub-group accounted for about one-fifth of the GVA in the pre-pandemic period. 56. Accordingly, the projection for H2:2022-23 has been revised upwards. It is also expected that the economic activity is likely to sustain momentum with full- fledged celebration of festivals after two years on the back of buffers of excess household savings, which will aid private consumption. Even though household\u2019s financial savings have normalised from a peak level of 12.0 per cent of GDP during 2020-21 to 8.3 per cent in 2021-22, it is estimated that households still had an excess saving of around 7 per cent of GDP at end-March 2022 - based on their net worth which is higher than the level at end-March 2020.4 As consumption gathers traction and capacity utilisation surges beyond a threshold, this could fuel investment \u2013 the second engine of growth. The real GDP growth for 2023-24, based on our macroeconomic model, is projected at 6.5 per cent.5 India assuming G-20 presidency in 2023 is likely to support economic activity with large infrastructure and tourism related investment. 57. Since the last bi-monthly, headline CPI inflation after moderating to 6.7 per cent in July edged up to 7.0 per cent in August. Even so, month-over-month change in headline CPI (or price momentum) was steady at around 0.5 per cent during June- August 2022 and two-way movement in inflation was brought about by base effects. Food and CPI core (CPI excluding food and fuel) drove price momentum in recent months, with core inflation remaining sticky around the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent. Food inflation registered a significant pick-up in August on accentuation of price pressures in cereals along with pulses, milk, vegetables and spices. Various exclusion-based measures of core were in range of 5.9 per cent to 6.2 per cent in August. In fact, all trimmed mean measures of core inflation edged up in August and were in the range of 6.2 per cent to 6.8 per cent, with weighted median registering a sharp 80 bps pick-up in August to 6.5 per cent. In some ways a pick-up of price pressures in core in August is also visible from core diffusion indices which firmed up in August. Inflation expectations also remain elevated. There is, however, reason for confidence on inflation slowing down within the 58. tolerance band next fiscal, given lagged impact of RBI rate hikes and easing of supply constraints. RBI\u2019s quarterly model-based projection shows that inflation rate during 2023-24, on an average, will be 5.2 per cent. 59. In the current macroeconomic mix, while a rate hike in this meeting is imminent, the choice between a 35 to 50 bps is a close call. Given the growth- inflation dynamics, my vote is for an increase in repo rate by 50 bps and continue with the policy stance of withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. First, with current inflation level and the uncertainty around it, mooring of inflation expectations is important to restrain the broadening of price pressures and enhance credibility of the central bank, the benefits of which I had explained in my last minutes. Second, by showing continued commitment to inflation target, monetary policy seeks focused attention on its \u2018inflation mandate\u2019. As we are living in an information-rich world, we may get carried away by certain information-fraction and tend to form expectations, impacting prices, consumption and investment. The committed monetary policy actions fix the attention of various agents in the economy on the \u2018inflation mandate\u2019 even when the current inflation is elevated. This, in turn, will again help to anchor inflation expectations.6 Third, the resilient growth about which I mentioned before provides us the space to act. Fourth, despite the recent empirical evidence supporting the perceived wisdom that real neutral rates declined both globally as well as in India7, we need to keep in mind the level of inflation and surplus liquidity conditions prevailing at this juncture. 60. Reflecting the increases in the policy repo rate, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans of SCBs has increased by 82 basis points during the period May to August 2022. The increase in share of external benchmark lending rate (EBLR) linked loans (46.9 per cent as at end-June 2022) coupled with shorter reset period for such loans have significantly improved the pace of transmission to WALR on outstanding loans. On the liability side, pass-through to term deposit rates is higher, if one considers both retail as well as bulk deposits. The extent of transmission is expected to improve further with the upward revision in interest rates on some small savings instruments. 61. In a scenario where growth momentum gains further traction and inflation pressures are projected to remain elevated over the remaining part of the year, before registering a moderation by Q1:2023-24, monetary policy has to persevere with its exit from accommodation to ensure that calibrated policy rate hikes dampen inflation expectations and firmly establish our commitment to price stability. This would help achieve the optimal mix of growth and inflation which will set the foundations for a high growth trajectory over the medium term. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 62. Central banks race in lockstep to raise policy rates by much more than their own historical experience. After all, current levels of inflation haven\u2019t been seen in decades. Are they overshooting, or overdoing it? They are balancing the prospects of a recession against the risks of inflation 63. remaining elevated and persistent. Given their mandates and the credibility they work hard to earn (in the pandemic, they prioritised revival over price stability which cannot be faulted, but it is), they prefer now to err on the side of hawkishness in their determination to bring inflation to targets, fearing a 1970s redux. 64. This inflation shock defeats conventional forecasting models. The parameters that characterise recent developments are far outside the ranges predicted by the conventional models. No one really knows what is too far or what is far enough in this environment. Central banks, therefore, adopt a risk minimisation strategy, ensuring they eradicate inflation, while allowing them to correct course and lower interest rates later if necessary. 65. Even so, currently available projections of inflation suggest that the real policy rates will remain negative up to close of 2022. Hence, more forceful tightening of monetary policy in 2023 may be required if terminal rates have to be achieved. This is being reflected in aggressive forward guidance, which has effectively restrained the relief rally that followed in the wake of pricing in of large rate actions in the recent past. Currency slides have become cliff events. Equities and bonds alike are selling off. Extreme risk aversion grips markets and investors. Inflation management is suddenly complicated by the crystallisation of the 66. impossible trinity. The conduct of domestically oriented monetary policy is becoming hostage to unidirectional exchange market volatility and mobile capital flows seeking safe haven. Recession risks may be darkening the horizon, but more immediately, global macroeconomic and financial stability is under threat. No country is immune. Systemic central banks should pay heed to the possibility that today\u2019s spillovers can become tomorrow\u2019s spillbacks. 67. For net commodity importers like India, with over a third of the CPI being imported, a negative terms of trade shock convolutes macroeconomic management. As current account deficits widen and capital flows turn fickle, reserve depletions become not just sources of forex liquidity to a risk wrung market but also instruments of stabilising expectations \u2013 the RBI stands for stability. Minimising volatility in the exchange rate becomes important from two points of view: (a) limiting risks to financial stability from foreign exchange exposures and pressures on margins of corporations; and (b) ensuring orderly functioning of financial markets so that volatility does not translate into financial stability risks. Accumulations during happier times have proved to be prudent. 68. Spillovers are global and overwhelming; however, the responsibility for securing stability is national. Each country is on its own. In India, the moderation in inflation that had commenced in May 2022 has 69. been interrupted by supply shocks which may extend into September. Although these shocks appear transitory at this juncture \u2013 barring energy prices which will be shaped by the evolving geopolitical situation \u2013 it is critical to remain watchful about second order effects if the shocks persist or recur. What is disquieting, however, is that inflation stripped of these transitory effects has become unyielding and tightly range bound around the upper tolerance band of the inflation target. The RBI\u2019s forward- looking surveys suggest that selling prices in manufacturing and services may rise further as pass-through from input cost pressures remains incomplete. Exchange rate volatility is amplifying these core price pressures, especially in view of key import prices being invoiced in the US dollar. Inflation expectations are rising, with signs that they are becoming unanchored over a one year ahead horizon. Taken together with a closing output gap, rising capacity utilisation in manufacturing, surging demand for services and the pick-up in spending as the festival season nears, monetary policy must move to red alert. 70. At this critical juncture, monetary policy has to perform the role of nominal anchor for the economy as it charts a new growth trajectory. The focus should be on being time consistent in aligning inflation with the target. In this context, front-loading of monetary policy actions can keep inflation expectations firmly anchored and balance demand against supply so that core inflation pressures ease. It will also reduce the medium-term growth sacrifice associated with steering inflation back to target because it is being timed into the strengthening of the recovery of the domestic economy that is underway and likely to gather further momentum as the year progresses. 71. Accordingly, I vote for increasing the policy repo rate by 50 basis points and for maintaining the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. The world is in the eye of a new storm originating from aggressive monetary 72. policy tightening and even more aggressive forward guidance from advanced economy (AE) central banks. This has resulted in a tightening of global financial conditions, extreme volatility in financial markets, risk aversion among investors and sharp appreciation of the US dollar. Such market turmoil on top of globalisation of inflation and deglobalisation of trade has hugely negative consequences for emerging market economies (EMEs). Even in AEs, the narrative is increasingly shifting from stagflation to possible recession. These developments are taking place even as the world is still grappling with the shocks from COVID-19 and the conflict in Ukraine. 73. Amidst all these, the Indian economy presents a picture of resilience with macroeconomic and financial stability. The balance sheet of key stakeholders like corporates and banks remain strong. In an interconnected world, however, the Indian economy is obviously impacted by the unsettled global environment. There are pronounced consequences not only for our domestic inflation and growth dynamics, but also financial markets. 74. On the growth front, economic activity is steadily improving. There are, however, mixed signals. While high frequency indicators are showing continued momentum in activity, global factors are putting pressure on external demand. The growth projection of 7.0 per cent for 2022-23, therefore, carries risks which are broadly balanced. Whatever be the unfolding scenario, India is expected to be among the fastest growing major economies in the world. 75. Headline inflation, on the other hand, remains elevated and above the upper tolerance band of the target. As per current projections, headline CPI is expected to moderate to 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2022-23 and further to 5.0 per cent in Q1 of 2023- 24. The future trajectory remains clouded with uncertainties arising from continuing geopolitical conflicts, possibility of further supply disruptions, volatile financial market conditions and domestic weather related factors. 76. Overall, I remain optimistic about the future prospects of the Indian economy, its resilience and capacity to deal with the current and emerging challenges. We need to do whatever is necessary and under our control to restrain broadening of price pressures, anchor inflation expectations and contain second round effects. The need of the hour is calibrated monetary policy action, with a clear understanding that it is required for sustaining our medium-term growth prospects. Accordingly, I vote for raising the policy repo rate by 50 bps. As regards the stance, I vote for remaining focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. It is important to note that even though the policy rate has moved to pre-pandemic levels, the overall monetary conditions taking into account the liquidity position and the inflation remain accommodative. The net liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) continues to be in surplus for more than three years. Liquidity in the system may also be seen in totality taking into account all moving variables including excess CRR and SLR holdings of banks, and revenue and expenditure pattern of the government. 77. Going forward, monetary policy needs to remain watchful and nimble, based on incoming data and evolving conditions. We should remain vigilant on the inflation front while strengthening our macroeconomic fundamentals. The financial and external sectors also continue to be under the Reserve Bank\u2019s close watch. In the final analysis, there is optimism and confidence around the India growth story and our current action is expected to add credence to that narrative. ", "file_10": "The fortieth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during December 5-7, 2022. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic 5. situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 7, 2022) decided to:  Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 6.00 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.50 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. The global economic outlook is skewed to the downside. Global growth is set to lose momentum as monetary policy actions tighten financial conditions and as consumer confidence weakens with the rising cost of livelihood. Inflation remains elevated and persistent across countries as they grapple with food and energy price shocks and shortages. More recently, however, there are some signs of moderation in price pressures, which have raised expectations of an easing in the pace of monetary tightening. Alongside easing in sovereign bond yields, the US dollar has come off its highs. Capital flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) remain volatile and global spillovers pose risks to growth prospects. Domestic Economy 7. On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 6.3 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2022-23 after an increase of 13.5 per cent in Q1. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) rose by 5.6 per cent in Q2. In Q3, economic activity is exhibiting resilience. In the agricultural sector, a pick-up 8. in rabi sowing (6.4 per cent higher than a year ago on December 2) is supported by the good progress of the north-east monsoon and above average reservoir levels. Activity in the industry and services sectors is in expansion mode, as reflected in purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) and other high frequency indicators. 9. Aggregate demand conditions have been supported by pent-up spending and discretionary expenditures during the festival season, although their evolution is somewhat uneven across sectors. Urban demand has remained buoyant, and rural demand is recovering. Investment activity is in modest expansion. Merchandise exports contracted in October after an expansion for 19 consecutive months. Growth in non-oil non-gold imports decelerated. 10. CPI inflation moderated to 6.8 per cent (y-o-y) in October 2022 from 7.4 per cent in September, with favourable base effects mitigating the impact of pick-up in price momentum in October. Food inflation softened, aided by easing inflation in vegetables and edible oils, despite sustained pressures from prices of cereals, milk and spices. Fuel inflation registered some easing in October, driven by softening of price inflation in LPG, kerosene (PDS) and firewood and chips. Core CPI (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation persisted at elevated levels at 6 per cent, with price pressures across most of its constituent sub-groups. The overall liquidity remains in surplus, with average daily absorption under the 11. liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) at \u20b91.4 lakh crore during October-November as compared with \u20b92.2 lakh crore in August-September. On a y-o-y basis, money supply (M3) expanded by 8.9 per cent as on November 18, 2022 while bank credit rose by 17.2 per cent. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 561.2 billion as on December 2, 2022. 12. The inflation trajectory going ahead would be shaped by both global and domestic factors. In case of food, while vegetable prices are likely to see seasonal winter correction, prices of cereals and spices may stay elevated in the near-term on supply concerns. High feed costs could also keep inflation elevated in respect of milk. Adverse climate events \u2013 both domestic and global \u2013 are increasingly becoming a significant source of upside risk to food prices. Global demand is weakening. Unabating geopolitical tensions continue to impart uncertainty to the food and energy prices outlook. The correction in industrial input prices and supply chain pressures, if sustained, could help ease pressures on output prices; but the pending pass-through of input costs could keep core inflation firm. Imported inflation risks from the US dollar movements need to be watched closely. Taking into account these factors and assuming an average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 100 per barrel, inflation is projected at 6.7 per cent in 2022- 23, with Q3 at 6.6 per cent and Q4 at 5.9 per cent, and risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2023-24 is projected at 5.0 per cent and for Q2 at 5.4 per cent, on the assumption of a normal monsoon (Chart 1). 13. On growth, the agricultural outlook has brightened, with the prospects of a good rabi harvest. The sustained rebound in contact-intensive sectors is supporting urban consumption. Robust and broad-based credit growth and government\u2019s thrust on capital spending and infrastructure should bolster investment activity. According to the RBI\u2019s survey, consumer confidence is improving. The economy, however, faces accentuated headwinds from protracted geopolitical tensions, tightening global financial conditions and slowing external demand. Taking all these factors into consideration, the real GDP growth for 2022-23 is projected at 6.8 per cent with Q3 at 4.4 per cent and Q4 at 4.2 per cent, with risks evenly balanced. Real GDP growth is projected at 7.1 per cent for Q1:2023-24 and at 5.9 per cent for Q2 (Chart 2). 14. Inflation has ruled at or above the upper tolerance band since January 2022 and core inflation is persisting around 6 per cent. Headline inflation is expected to remain above or close to the upper threshold in Q3 and Q4:2022-23. It is likely to moderate in H1:2023-24 but will still remain well above the target. Meanwhile, economic activity has held up well and is expected to be resilient, supported by domestic demand. Net exports would remain subdued due to the drag from evolving external demand conditions. Further, the impact of monetary policy measures undertaken needs to be watched. On balance, the MPC is of the view that, further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break the core inflation persistence and contain second round effects, so as to strengthen medium-term growth prospects. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points to 6.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 15. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted against the repo rate hike. 16. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted against this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on December 21, 2022. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 6-8, 2023. Voting on the Resolution to increase the policy repo rate to 6.25 per cent 19. The official estimate of year-on-year real GDP growth in Q2: FY 2022-23 at 6.3 per cent equals the September 2022 forecast by RBI. Although the YOY growth in Q2 is well below 13.5 per cent registered in Q1, it reflects a strong sequential momentum with QOQ growth at 3.6 per cent. Private Final Consumption Expenditure, Gross Fixed Capital Expenditure and exports of goods and services have shown sequential expansion over Q1. However, going forward, the growth scenario would be affected adversely by the slowing global growth even as growth-supportive policy measures provide new opportunities in the economy. 20. A review of wide range of indicators of the recent economic activity point to a mixed outlook for growth. The Index of industrial production (IIP) for September 2022, the latest month for which data are available, increased by 3.1 per cent YOY basis. However, the pattern has been uneven across sectors and also over time. In August the growth was negative after a modest growth of 2.2 per cent in July. IIP Consumer Non-durables declined in July, August and September, while it was negative in August and September for Consumer Durables. Gross Value Added from manufacturing and industry as a whole declined in Q2: FY 2022-23 and rose for Services. Value of merchandise exports declined in October by 12.1 per cent in US$ terms, after a sharp deceleration in Q2. Services exports have expanded YOY basis in October but declined relative to September. 21. On the positive note, IIP for Capital Goods and Infrastructure, and Construction registered acceleration on YOY basis in September. Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for manufacturing and services remained in expansion zone in October and November 2022. Although non-oil non-gold merchandise imports declined in October over September, they remained above the level in the same period in the previous year. GST collections registered YOY double digit growth in October and November. Non-food credit growth was high, averaging 17.6 per cent during September-November. The qualitative indicators from the RBI\u2019s surveys of urban households for 22. September and November 2022 point to a gradual improvement in sentiments relating to overall economic conditions, employment and income. Increased consumer spending is supported by \u2018non-essential\u2019 items, with an expected improvement in sentiments for \u2018discretionary\u2019 spending only on one-year ahead basis. 23. While the economic activity levels moving into Q3: FY 2022-23 suggest resilience, outlook is, however, faced with the slowing global growth conditions. The global growth outlook has deteriorated since the last meeting of the MPC in late September. The IMF in its October 2022 World Economic Outlook projects a decline of world output growth YOY basis from 6.0 per cent in 2021 to 3.2 per cent in 2022 and 2.7 per cent in 2023, with downside risks to projections. The external demand conditions and capital flows to EMEs may weaken as a consequence. As the causes of the global growth slow down include the impact of COVID 19 related issues in China and the Ukraine war, besides the monetary policy tightening measures across countries, the outlook is also affected by the risk of high energy and food prices as their supply chains get disrupted. 24. Taking into account the trends in key exogenous global and domestic conditions, the revised real GDP growth rate, YOY basis, for FY 2022-23 is 6.8 per cent with Q3 and Q4 at 4.4 and 4.2 per cent, respectively. The revised growth rate for FY 2022-23 is lower by 20 basis points from the projections provided in the September MPC meeting. The GDP growth rate for FY 2023-24 is projected at 7.1 per cent for Q1 and 5.9 per cent for Q2. 25. The YOY CPI inflation moderated to 6.8 per cent in October from 7.4 per cent in September, with decline of 140 basis points in food inflation and 50 bps in fuel & light. The core inflation, based on CPI components excluding food and fuel remained at 6 per cent. The MOM momentum of prices, however, remained high. The headline CPI increased by 0.8 per cent in October over September, contributed by significant month- over-month increase in all the major components of CPI. 26. The general upward pressure on inflation may be attributed to incomplete transmission of previous input price hikes even as overall demand conditions show gradual improvement. The successive supply side shocks affecting the costs and prices beginning with the rising input and energy prices, food prices and strengthening US dollar may not have been fully offset by the rising selling prices in all sectors. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation, a measure of producer level prices, dropped to single digit (8.4 per cent) in October 2022 for the first time after a run of double-digit annual increase since April 2021. WPI YOY inflation for manufactured products category as a whole has been in single digits since June 2022 although for many energy items, the inflation rate remains in double digits. Declining profitability of firms seen in the corporate performance in Q2: FY 2022-23 in the manufacturing sector is one indication of the inability to recover all the cost increases fully. The RBI Inflation Expectations Survey of Households in urban areas conducted in 27. November indicates a drop in the median perceived headline inflation rate in November 2022 compared to September. The expectations of inflation rate three-month ahead and one-year ahead have also moderated in November compared to the expectations in September. However, the decline follows an upturn experienced in September and accordingly, the moderation of CPI inflation in October may have influenced the current household expectations. The Business Inflation Expectations Survey conducted by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad1 points to a reduction of one-year ahead inflation based on unit costs to less than 5 per cent in August and September 2022, although 45 per cent of the respondents continue to see the one-year ahead inflation rate at 6 per cent or above. The survey has also reflected a declining pattern of one-year ahead CPI inflation rate. 28. Taking into account the current trends in both domestic and international commodity prices and their major determinants, the CPI inflation rate for the full current financial year has been retained at 6.7 per cent, the same level as in the September meeting. The projections of CPI inflation rate for Q2 and Q3 are at 6.6 and 5.9 per cent, respectively. The projected YOY inflation rates for Q1 and Q2 of 2023-24 are also below 6 per cent. The median headline inflation rate projected by the RBI survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in November 2022 is at 6.6 per cent for Q3: FY 2022-23 and 6.1 per cent for Q4: FY 2022-23, with 6.7 per cent for the financial year as a whole. 29. With overall domestic growth showing signs of resilience, the adverse global macroeconomic conditions require that domestic inflation rate is at moderate levels, within the tolerance band of the inflation target on a sustained basis. The persistence of core inflation at the upper limit of the tolerance band of the inflation target is of particular concern. Slippage on both growth and inflation objectives together would be a poor outcome. Keeping in view the need to achieve moderation in the inflationary pressures in a sustained manner, continuing with the monetary policy tightening measures is necessary at this stage. 30. Accordingly, (1) I vote to increase the policy repo rate by 35 basis points and also (2) I vote to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 31. Multiple global risks continue but as a growth slowdown threatens many countries, inflation and rate actions of major central banks are also slowing. While continuing to talk tough, even the US Fed has recognized the importance of monetary lags and of responding to economic and social developments. There is a view that since US long- term inflation expectations remain at 3 per cent, the ex-ante real rate is already restrictive. 32. Markets have priced in a possible pivot, although communication shocks continue to create volatility. The dollar is weakening especially as other advanced economy central banks also raise rates. The worst of the adjustment seems past. India saw a return of inflows in July, a few months before the reversal in other emerging markets (EMs) in November\u2014indicating confidence in India\u2019s outperformance. FX reserves are rising again. Large rupee depreciation is unlikely to add to inflation pressures in the months ahead. 33. Global commodity prices have softened. The index for Indian supply chain pressures has been falling since May 2021. It is now below the long-period average. The impact is visible in the sharp fall in India\u2019s WPI. That this is falling without a substantial pass through to CPI, suggests that firms have not raised prices to the extent of input cost pressures. This may be partly due to soft demand and cost-saving measures, and hopefully the beginnings of the realization that cost shocks are temporary if the inflation target is working to anchor expectations. The IIM Ahmedabad business inflation expectation survey shows moderation in cost pressures and in sales, while one year ahead inflation expectation remains below 5%, although profit margins are expected to rise with the fall in costs. The gap between PMI input and output prices has almost closed for manufacturing while it has fallen significantly from its May peak levels for services. Good sowing despite extended rains is lowering food prices. 34. In core inflation the contribution of transport and communication is reducing, as is another dominant component, clothing, after cotton prices peaked in August. Persistence is due to multiple supply shocks more than to second round effects. RBI inflation forecasts are based on the assumption of the Indian crude oil basket at $100 but India\u2019s current basket is ruling much below this level. Although domestic pass-through is yet to happen, downside risks to inflation are high. 35. Indian exports and manufacturing output are slowing with global demand; that imports are also decelerating, even with only about 60% pass through in fresh loans, suggests domestic demand is also shrinking. Anecdotal evidence indicates small firms are finding it too expensive to invest. Their contribution is necessary to reverse the investment slowdown of the last decade, to prevent future bottlenecks and rise in costs and to build export and employment capacity. India has excess non-oil imports partly because this capacity was not built in the last decade. 36. Inflation targeting anchors inflation if policy rates rise one for one with expected inflation, so the expected real rate is positive and close to the equilibrium rate. Second, lagged transmission of higher policy rates lowers demand. The MPC has made sure of the first and the second is in process. 37. The average inflation projection for the next four quarters is 5.7% and in Q2FY24 it is 5.4%. So the real policy rate is positive and will rise through the year. Since there are many factors working to chill demand, policy has to be careful in adding to these. Multiple estimations show that through the demand channel of transmission, Indian interest rates affect output first and inflation less and only with long lags. 38. Moreover, interest rate spreads in the Indian system are high. While the yield spread of investment grade G-secs over hard currency sovereign yields averaged 200bps for emerging markets2; the Indian 10 year G-sec spread over the US 10 year is about double this (rates were 7.21% compared to 3.5% on December 1). The 3 month commercial paper rate is above 7%. Higher spreads imply a larger demand reducing effect of a rise in the policy repo rate. Pass through to loan rates is also faster with the external benchmark for loan rates. 2 IMF. 2022. 'Global Financial Stability Report: Navigating the High-Inflation Environment.' International Monetary Fund. October. Available at: https://www.imf.org/en/publications/gfsrIMF GFSR. See Fig 3 in the executive summary. 39. At present, however, Indian imports are still too high. A sticky terms of trade shock lowers potential output, requiring demand to fall. In addition, inflation still exceeds the MPC tolerance band for the 10th consecutive month. So I vote to raise the repo rate by 35bps to 6.25%. I would have preferred a smaller rise of 25bps, but 6.25% works well as a focal rate. 40. Other instruments are available, apart from a demand contraction, to attain a more sustainable current account deficit (CAD). These include export promotion, building domestic capacity and reducing dependence on oil imports. India\u2019s remittances and software exports remain robust and the transition to a green economy is progressing well. Rising share of financial savings will also reduce the CAD. There are also multiple financing options for the CAD. 41. Since India does not have full capital account convertibility, the uncovered interest parity (UIP) relation that says nominal domestic interest rates must equal US nominal rates plus expected rupee depreciation does not hold in its pure form. Standard advice based on the UIP is a way to force other countries to follow US policy. They must either raise domestic rates with Fed rates to prevent depreciation; or under inflation targeting let the currency depreciate then raise rates as inflation rises. But this is the way to aggravate foreign shocks. 42. India has the space to suit policy to domestic needs and has done better because it has used it. Capital flow management and intervention has successfully prevented excess depreciation. Reserves are rising again. The interest gap is larger for longer periods and in real terms3. For short rates prudential measures such as reducing banks\u2019 open position limits can be used if necessary, without following US rate hikes. 43. Coming to the stance, withdrawal of accommodation was alright as long as the large liquidity surpluses and excessive rate cuts of pandemic times persisted. But durable liquidity seems to have contracted so much that the LAF system has not been able to compensate for liquidity shocks during the last two months. The call money rate has exceeded the repo rate for much of the time. It is time to move to a neutral stance, where movement can be data-based in any required direction, as new information affects forward projections. Accordingly, I vote against the part of the resolution on remaining focused on the withdrawal of accommodation. 44. An EM faces large liquidity shocks, especially as major countries go in for quantitative tightening. The LAF system has made much progress and should be able to prevent excessive short-term liquidity tightening. If shocks are too large adequate surplus should be created in durable liquidity. An inflation targeting regime itself provides the inflation anchor; the anchor is not money or liquidity supply. 45. In response to market volatility after the Truss budget, the Bank of England has shown how clear communication can separate the market-making from the monetary policy function of liquidity. While market-making may be required in AEs with high leverage and under-regulation of the non-bank financial sector, in India it can be used to ensure financial conditions are able to support the creation of credit even as repo rates rise. Financial regulation and balance sheets have strengthened, lending is risk-based, corporates have de-leveraged. It is time for a reversal of the credit drought of the last decade. 46. Since the September meeting, the balance of risks has shifted decisively away from inflation to growth both globally and domestically. There are now clear signs that the global supply side shocks emanating from the pandemic and the Ukraine war are finally receding. The strongest signal is the sharp fall in crude prices in the second half of November. Global inflation seems to have peaked and is now probably heading lower. Added to this is the fact that it is only over the next few quarters that the real economy will experience the full brunt of the front-loaded tightening by central banks across the world. All in all, there is much reason to be optimistic about global inflationary pressures easing. In this context, I would like to point out that the RBI\u2019s inflation projections (as well 47. as that of some professional forecasters surveyed by the RBI) are still based on the assumption of an average crude price (Indian basket) of $100. This is about 15-20% higher than the Brent crude futures curve at the time of this meeting. Perhaps, these forecasters believe that the Brent futures market is unreliable due to various behavioural biases. But an assumption so sharply at deviance from liquid market prices needs to be justified on the basis of economic and geopolitical fundamentals. In mid-November, the futures market appears to have reassessed the geopolitical pulls and pressures on OPEC in the light of observed political outcomes. If the forecasters disagree with this reassessment, they need to articulate and justify their alternative narrative. In the absence of such articulation, one could be pardoned for suggesting that the $100 Brent the well known behavioural biases of salience and crude assumption reflects conservatism. 48. On the domestic front also, there is strong evidence of easing of inflationary pressures. The pricing power of producers appears to have eroded dramatically as reflected in the sharp reduction in corporate profitability. Inflation has eased from the 7%+ levels witnessed in the middle of the year, and more importantly inflation expectations of both households and businesses have trended down. 49. On the other hand, growth concerns have become more troubling in recent months both globally and domestically. Financial markets are pricing in the likelihood of a the pandemic, exports and recession government spending were the two growth engines that counteracted the headwinds confronting the Indian economy. Of these, the global slowdown has already led to the export growth engine grinding to a halt. Fiscal constraints limit the ability of government spending to hold up the economy on its own. Private investment is unlikely to be able to pick up the slack. Anecdotal evidence suggests that concerns about future growth prospects are deterring capital investment even by companies that have reached more than 80% capacity utilization. That leaves only private consumption which has remained buoyant, but it remains to be seen how much of this is due to pent up demand which could dissipate over the coming months. All of this means that economic growth is now extremely fragile and definitely not robust enough to withstand excessive monetary tightening. 50. I believe that the 35 basis point rate hike approved by the majority of the MPC is not warranted in this context of reduced inflationary pressures and heightened growth concerns. I therefore vote against this resolution. quarters. The MPC has raised the repo rate by 225 basis points in about eight months. Accounting for the fact that in 2021 money market rates were close to the reverse repo rate (65 basis points below the repo rate), the full magnitude of monetary tightening would be 290 basis points. Much of the impact of this large front-loaded monetary policy action is yet to be felt in the real economy. For these reasons, I believe that 6.25% itself very likely overshoots the repo rate needed to achieve price stability, and poses an unwarranted risk to economic growth. The majority of the MPC is saying that they intend to tighten even more by withdrawing accommodation. This stance would be even more damaging to the fragile growth outlook and I therefore vote against this resolution also. In these uncertain and difficult times, monetary policy making is a daunting task. 52. Achieving and maintaining credibility4 \u2013 a valuable asset for any central bank \u2013 is still a bigger challenge. In the quest to rein in inflation while supporting growth, central banks are, therefore, confronted with an important decision of \u2018how fast, how far and how long\u20195 the ongoing tightening phase should continue. While entailing difficult trade-offs, these choices and its combinations, as would be eventually decided upon by the central banks, remain vital and would set the tone for the world economy in the ensuing year. Some central banks have already started considering a pivot towards slower pace and lesser quantum of rate hikes or taking a pause on the tightening cycle. 53. India is no different. There are several forces at work. One has to consider not only evolving domestic growth and inflation dynamics, while also accounting for related factors like cumulative tightening and its impact, lags in transmission, unexpected global and domestic shocks, the terminal rate itself, among others. Moving slowly and doing too little could lead to macroeconomic instability with the unhinging of inflation expectations which, more importantly, may warrant stronger actions later that could be much more detrimental than the costs of overtightening.6 On the contrary, doing too much could hurt growth. Conventionally, monetary policy credibility varies endogenously with the policy pursued and a non-gradualist approach leads to enhanced credibility, can bring faster disinflation that entails lower sacrifice ratio (Sargent, 1986; Ball, 1994).7 These outcomes are, however, subject to several rigidities and irrationality that may result in larger growth sacrifice. Therefore, monetary policy needs to be watchful depending upon evolving macroeconomic signals in balancing between gradualism and acting too fast, too soon. 54. As I had indicated in my statement of September 2022, there was a close call between increasing the policy repo rate by 35 bps or 50 bps. After frontloaded rate hikes since May 2022, there is a strong case now to take the foot off the accelerator while keeping a sharp vigil on the inflation trajectory. Moreover, with inflation trajectory panning out broadly along anticipated lines and also, considering the ongoing pass-through of earlier monetary policy actions and the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, monetary policy response can be calibrated to a lesser order. Thus, an increase of 35 bps is felt appropriate at the current juncture, while also continuing with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation, and I vote for the same. Any change in stance at this stage could be interpreted as weakening of our resolve to fight the inflation menace and will impede 4 See my statement in \u201cMinutes of the Monetary Policy committee meeting of August 2022\u201d released on August 19, 2022. 5 \u201cFront-loading\u201d monetary tightening: pros and cons, BIS Bulletin, December 2022. 6 IMF, World Economic Outlook, September 2022. 7 Ball, L., 1994.

The objective is to ensure a sustained disinflation that brings inflation down within the tolerance band in the short-run and closer to the target over the medium term, while supporting growth. These decisions are premised on the following considerations. Though there has been moderation in inflation by 60 bps in October, certain 55. underlying trends need to be closely watched. First, price momentum in October was at the highest level since May 2022 and has also showed a sequential increase since August 2022. Second, core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation remains sticky at 6 per cent, with its momentum in October being the highest since April 2022, even on a seasonally adjusted basis. In fact, deflation in petrol and diesel has masked the full extent of inflationary pressures in core. Excluding petrol and diesel, transportation and communication inflation was at 7.7 per cent. Trimmed mean measures of inflation remained elevated. Third, there is evidence of continuing generalisation of price pressures, especially in core. Diffusion indices for CPI headline and core continued to show strong expansion in prices across the CPI basket. These factors suggest persistent price pressures, which along with geo-political tensions and adverse climate events adds to uncertainty, warranting a continuation of calibrated monetary policy action. 56. Growth, on the other hand, remains resilient with drag coming mainly from net exports. Faster reopening of China, signs of deceleration in inflation in US and easing global commodity prices are tailwinds which may limit the downside to the world demand in 2023. From our perspective, signs of peaking of US dollar appreciation with lower crude prices, despite news of early reopening in China, are strong positives. Though lower crude prices would not help inflation immediately8 due to unchanged petrol and diesel pump prices as under-recoveries of Oil Marketing companies (OMCs) continue, but will help external sector balance with lower imports, which already is showing sign of tapering. Importantly, the trend in the momentum of the major components of GDP is assuring. For instance, the momentum of real GDP in Q2:2022-23 has been robust at 3.6 per cent as against pre-pandemic (2012-13 to 2019-20) average of 0.9 per cent; similarly, the two main drivers of GDP \u2013 private consumption and investment \u2013 recorded a momentum of 1.0 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively, in Q2, as against negative pre- pandemic average momentum for Q2 [(-)0.1 per cent and (-)1.4 per cent, respectively, during 2012-13 to 2019-20)]. On the supply side, a strong rebound in contact-intensive services (trade, hotels, transportation, communication and others) with a momentum of 16.0 per cent (as against pre-pandemic average momentum of (-)1.6 per cent during 2012-13 to 2019-20) underpinned the growth in real GVA in Q2. 57. The discussion on terminal rate in monetary policy is clouded by the uncertainty on the strength and direction of growth and inflation impulses. In this scenario, the important point to note is that the terminal rate is time varying and has to be discovered based on incoming data and evolving situation. With the rate hikes done so far, and considering the inflation outlook, it can be said with certainty that real rates have moved decisively towards positive territory, yet one cannot be sure of the same if one uses the realised current inflation argument, which is fast gaining ground under uncertain conditions.9 Ensuring monetary conditions and stance are appropriately calibrated to current growth- inflation dynamics is crucial as bank deposit and lending rates in real terms are much lower than pre-pandemic levels. 58. Overall, monetary policy geared towards price stability while taking into account output dynamics is the best guarantee to ensure lasting prosperity. Besides, in all probability, growth concerns globally and in India may assume primacy in 2023 as the global economy slows down on the back of tightening financial conditions even as global supply chains get restored and input cost pressures ease from current levels. 59. Recent data arrivals point to a pick-up in seasonally adjusted momentum of real GDP growth into positive territory in the second quarter of 2022-23. Notably, this improvement has occurred on the strength of domestic drivers that overcame the contraction in net exports. Projections indicate that positive momentum will likely be sustained through the rest of the year. It remains to be seen if the strength of that momentum is able to offset strong, pandemic-induced unfavourable base effects. For 2023-24, a tempering of the pace of real GDP growth relative to this year\u2019s rate needs to be factored in, given warnings of global slowdown and hence a rising drag from net exports for India; still muted domestic private investment in spite of capacity utilisation having crossed trend levels in a number of industries; and, tightening financial conditions. 60. On the other hand, inflation in India remains unconscionably elevated, persistent and generalised, despite a grudging let-up in October solely due to favourable base effects. The momentum of price increases was, in fact, the highest since May 2022. Core inflation remains unyielding and diffused, with a rising price momentum as it tests the upper tolerance band on its own, warranting resolute monetary policy resolve to quell it. Evolving global inflation movements juxtaposed with our projections would suggest that India\u2019s headline inflation may ease slightly through the rest of the year. The effects of monetary policy actions taken so far, supported by improvements in supply responses, could break the 7 per cent plus drift in average headline inflation and at best contain it in the range of 5-6 per cent over the year ahead. Thus, inflation can be expected to remain above target over the next 12 months. 61. The longer inflation stays at current levels, the greater is the danger of expectations getting unhinged, frittering away the moderation reported in the most recent surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters. The risk of inflation eroding purchasing power and weakening consumer spending, especially on discretionary items, is becoming significant. Inflation expectations may also be stalling private investment in capacity creation, as reflected in corporate performance during the second quarter of 2022-23. 62. Accordingly, further withdrawal of accommodation is warranted to re-balance aggregate demand against supply conditions and return inflation first into the tolerance band and then to alignment with the target. This is essential for sustaining the positive turn in the momentum of growth. 63. The size and pace of further increases in the policy rate should take into account this inflation objective. It is also necessary to incorporate the effects of cumulative rate increases undertaken so far, the transmission to longer-term rates achieved so far, the movements in real interest rates, and the ongoing impact on macroeconomic and financial conditions as they evolve. Accordingly, a modest reduction in the size of the policy rate increase in this meeting would provide the opportunity to weigh that assessment carefully. 64. Should the incoming information indicate that the recent small easing of inflation is transient rather than the onset of a durable downturn, the MPC should be prepared to respond appropriately in order to achieve the desired inflation objective. In essence, the MPC needs to see a decisive decline in inflation over a series of monthly readings before it shifts stance, which would otherwise be premature. 65. remains focused on the withdrawal of accommodation. I vote for an increase in the policy rate by 35 basis points and a stance that 66. Amidst headwinds from slowing global growth and trade, the Indian economy is exhibiting resilience and holding up well. Real GDP growth at 6.3 per cent in Q2:2022-23 was on the lines expected by us. Incoming information for Q3 indicates that economic activity remains strong. Living as we are in an interconnected world, we cannot remain entirely decoupled from adverse global spillovers. External demand is weakening and this is having its negative impact on our exports. Overall, India\u2019s real GDP is expected to grow by 6.8 per cent in 2022-23 and India will remain amongst the fastest growing major economies, even as rising recession possibilities characterise the global economy. 67. Headline inflation is moderating, albeit slowly. While the worst of inflation is behind us, it remains above the upper tolerance level. It is expected to decline in H1:2023-24 but would still be well above the target. Uncertainties surrounding the inflation trajectory remain sizeable, given the geopolitical tensions, global financial market volatility, pending pass-through of input costs to domestic output prices and weather-related disruptions. Core inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel) is exhibiting persistence around 6 per cent for the past few months. Hence, there is no room for complacency and the battle against inflation is not over. This necessitates a constant vigil on prices. 68. Our successive rate actions since May 2022 are working through the system. Considering the elevated inflation levels, especially the stickiness in core inflation, further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to contain build-up in underlying inflationary pressures, keep inflation expectations anchored, and bring inflation closer to the target rate of 4 per cent over the medium term. This would strengthen the medium- term growth prospects of the Indian economy. I am, therefore, of the view that a premature pause in monetary policy action 69. would be a costly policy error at this juncture. Given the uncertain outlook, it may engender a situation where we may find ourselves striving to do a catch-up through stronger policy actions in the subsequent meetings to ward-off accentuated inflationary pressures. I, therefore, vote for an increase of 35 basis points in the repo rate \u2013 a departure from 50 bps on three previous occasions \u2013 which itself conveys the signal of an improvement in the inflation outlook. 70. Considering the prevailing policy repo rate, liquidity conditions and the expected trajectory of inflation over the next several months, it is essential to persist with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. Hence, I vote for the same. 71. To conclude, let me add that in a tightening cycle, especially in a world of high uncertainty, giving out explicit forward guidance on the future path of monetary policy would be counterproductive. This may result in the market and its participants overshooting the actual play out of real conditions. In such circumstances, it would be prudent to keep Arjuna\u2019s eye on the evolving inflation dynamics and be ready to act as may be necessary. Monetary policy has to be nimble to address any emerging risk to the price stability, while keeping in mind the objective of growth. ", "file_11": "The forty first meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during February 6-8, 2023. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve 3. Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic 5. situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (February 8, 2023) decided to: Increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.50 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. The outlook on global growth has improved in recent months, despite the persistence of geopolitical hostilities and the impact of monetary policy tightening by central banks across the world. Nonetheless, global growth is expected to decelerate during 2023. Inflation is exhibiting some softening from elevated levels, prompting central banks to moderate the size and pace of rate actions. However, central banks are reiterating their commitment to bring down inflation close to their targets. Bond yields remain volatile. The US dollar has come off its recent peak, and equity markets have moved higher since the last MPC meeting. Weak external demand in major advanced economies (AEs), the rising incidence of protectionist policies, volatile capital flows and debt distress could, however, weigh adversely on prospects for emerging market economies (EMEs). Domestic Economy 7. The first advance estimates (FAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on January 6, 2023, placed India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.0 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) for 2022-23, driven by private consumption and investment. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) was estimated at 6.7 per cent. High frequency indicators suggest that economic activity has remained strong in 8. Q3 and Q4:2022-23. Rabi acreage exceeded last year\u2019s area by 3.3 per cent as on February 3, 2023. Industrial production expanded by 7.1 per cent in November, after contracting by 4.2 per cent in October. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing is now above its long period average. Port freight traffic, e-way bills and toll collections were buoyant in December. Purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) for manufacturing as well as services remained in expansion in January, despite some moderation compared to the previous month. 9. Domestic demand has been sustained by strong discretionary spending. Urban demand exhibited resilience as reflected in healthy passenger vehicle sales and domestic air passenger traffic. Rural demand is improving. Investment activity is gradually gaining ground. Non-oil non-gold imports expanded in December. Merchandise exports, on the other hand, contracted in December on weak global demand. 10. CPI headline inflation moderated to 5.7 per cent (y-o-y) in December 2022 \u2013 after easing to 5.9 per cent in November \u2013 on the back of double digit deflation in vegetable prices. On the other hand, inflationary pressures accentuated across cereals, protein- based food items and spices. Fuel inflation edged up primarily from an uptick in kerosene prices. Core CPI (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation rose to 6.1 per cent in December due to sustained price pressures in health, education and personal care and effects. The overall liquidity remains in surplus, with average daily absorption under the 11. LAF increasing to \u20b91.6 lakh crore during December-January from an average of \u20b91.4 lakh crore in October-November. On a y-o-y basis, money supply (M3) expanded by 9.8 per cent as on January 27, 2023, while non-food bank credit rose by 16.7 per cent. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 576.8 billion as on January 27, 2023. 12. The outlook for inflation is mixed. While prospects for the rabi crop have improved, especially for wheat and oilseeds, risks from adverse weather events remain. The global commodity price outlook, including crude oil, is subject to uncertainties on demand prospects as well as from risks of supply disruptions due to geopolitical tensions. Commodity prices are expected to face upward pressures with the easing of COVID- related mobility restrictions in some parts of the world. The ongoing pass-through of input costs to output prices, especially in services, could continue to exert pressures on core inflation. The Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys point to some softening of input cost and output price pressures in manufacturing. Taking into account these factors and assuming an average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 95 per barrel, inflation is projected at 6.5 per cent in 2022-23, with Q4 at 5.7 per cent. On the assumption of a normal monsoon, CPI inflation is projected at 5.3 per cent for 2023-24, with Q1 at 5.0 per cent, Q2 at 5.4 per cent, Q3 at 5.4 per cent and Q4 at 5.6 per cent, and risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). 13. The stronger prospects for agricultural and allied activities are likely to boost rural demand. The rebound in contact-intensive sectors and discretionary spending is expected to support urban consumption. Businesses and consumers surveyed by the Reserve Bank are optimistic about the outlook. Strong credit growth, resilient financial markets, and the government\u2019s continued thrust on capital spending and infrastructure create a congenial environment for investment. On the other hand, external demand is likely to be dented by a slowdown in global activity, with adverse implications for exports. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.4 per cent with Q1 at 7.8 per cent, Q2 at 6.2 per cent, Q3 at 6.0 per cent and Q4 at 5.8 per cent, and risks broadly balanced (Chart 2). 14. The easing of inflation in the last two months was driven by strong deflation in vegetables, which may dissipate with the summer season uptick. Headline inflation excluding vegetables has been rising well above the upper tolerance band and may remain elevated, especially with high core inflation pressures. Inflation, therefore, remains a major risk to the outlook. Domestic economic activity is expected to remain resilient aided by the sustained focus on capital and infrastructure spending in the Union Budget 2023-24, even as continuing fiscal consolidation creates space for private investment. While the policy repo rate increases undertaken since May 2022 are working their way through the system, it is imperative to remain alert on inflation so as to ensure that it remains within the tolerance band and progressively aligns with the target. On balance, the MPC is of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break core inflation persistence and thereby strengthen medium-term growth prospects. Accordingly, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.50 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 15. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted against the repo rate hike. 16. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted against this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on February 22, 2023. 16. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voted against this part of the resolution. 17. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during April 3, 5 and 6, 2023. Voting on the Resolution to increase the policy repo rate to 6.50 per cent 19. The present trajectories of inflation and growth, relative to the situation that prevailed in the December 2022 MPC meeting reflect continued moderation in the pace of CPI inflation seen in November into December and also holding on to the growth momentum projected for FY 2022-23. However, the moderation seen in inflation is mainly driven by a few food commodities and the CPI excluding food and fuel, remained at or above 6 per cent, year on year basis, during November-December 2022. On the growth front, the slowdown in the pace of global output growth has begun to impact external demand conditions. While the indicators such as non-food bank credit, GST collections and PMI for both manufacturing and services point to the continued momentum of domestic demand, the overall YOY growth in H2 of 2022-23 is expected to be lower compared to H1. The evolving trajectories of growth and inflation in the short term are, therefore, subject to significant uncertainty. The First Advance Estimates of national income by the NSO for FY 2022-23 place 20. the real GDP growth at 7 per cent over the previous year, slightly above the assessment provided during the December 2022 meeting of the MPC. The first official estimates of the economic activity by the NSO for the year 2022-23 as a whole point to the continued modest growth momentum over the pre-pandemic year, in the face of multiple challenges that emerged through the year. Private Consumption Expenditure, Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Exports of Goods and Services rose YOY basis, but at slower pace than in 2021-22. The growth performance in FY 2022-23 was contributed mainly by the sharp rise of 13.5 per cent in Q1 followed by an expected average of 5.1 per cent in the subsequent three quarters. Nevertheless, the year has seen steady quarter-on quarter growth momentum. 21. The IMF projections of World Output growth for 2022 and 2023 have been revised upward in the January 2023 World Economic Outlook Update compared to the assessment in October 2022. However, the output growth rate in 2023 is projected to decline to 2.9 per cent from 3.4 percent in 2022 and then rise to 3.1 per cent in 2024. Growth in the World trade volume is projected to decline sharply in 2023 with a pickup in the momentum in 2024. Commodity prices - both fuel and non-fuel - are projected to decline by the IMF in 2023 and 2024. The IMF update also notes that the risks to the projections are on the downside, with lower growth and higher inflation, but more moderate than its October 2022 assessment. 22. The impact of slowdown of growth globally on India\u2019s external sector was evident in the slower pace of growth of exports and imports of goods and services in terms of constant rupee value. In terms of US dollar value, merchandise exports growth was negative in Q3: 2022-23. Merchandise imports growth, YOY basis, declined sharply in Q3 turning negative in December. 23. As the external demand conditions remain weak, domestic growth impulses are necessary for sustaining aggregate demand. The FAE point to GVA growth of 13.7 per cent YOY basis in 2022-23 in trade, transport, communication and broadcasting services driving growth in the services sector as a whole at 9.1 per cent. Industry, in contrast, is projected to grow by less than 3 per cent and manufacturing by less than 2 per cent in terms of GVA. For industry, even in terms of IIP, the growth performance in 2022-23 has been fluctuating. IIP for capital goods and infrastructure/ construction goods rose sharply in November 2022, on YOY basis, after a weak growth in October. Similar pattern was seen during August and September 2022. IIP Consumer durables and non-durables registered negative YOY growth rates during August 2022 to October 2022, to rise in November 2022. In this sense, a balanced growth performance will require significant acceleration in the manufacturing growth that will also require rising demand for manufactured goods. The Union Budget for 2023-24 with its stepped up capital expenditure will support capital formation in the key areas of infrastructure. 24. In terms of forward-looking data, the RBI survey of consumer confidence conducted in January 2023, reflects improvement in one-year ahead expectations buoyed by expectations of higher spending, improved general economic conditions, employment and income. However, the spending sentiments appear cautious, especially the \u2018non-essential expenditure\u2019. While there is an increase in the proportion of sample households who expect to spend more on \u2018essential items\u2019 over the previous round of the survey, the sample households are evenly divided on the expectations to increase or not increase the \u2018non-essential spending\u2019 one year ahead from now. The caution appears to be related to the expectation of higher inflation rate. The one-year ahead consumer expectations point to a higher inflation rate compared to the prevailing conditions. The enterprise surveys on outlook conducted by RBI during mid-October to mid- 25. December 2022 reflect improved overall business situation in the immediate term of Q4:2022-23 for manufacturing and infrastructure but stable for services after an overall significant improvement in Q3 for all three segments. The expectations for the first two quarters of 2023-24 are mixed, with the manufacturing sector enterprises showing diminished expectations, while expectations of services and infrastructure enterprises remain unchanged from Q4: 2022-23. The NCAER-NSE Business Confidence Index1 based on the quarterly survey of enterprises conducted in December 2022 was higher YOY basis but fell sequentially as compared to Q1 and Q2: 2022-23. 26. The inflation pattern in November and December 2022 shows moderation in price pressures at the aggregate level but the moderation is resulting mainly from a sharp decline in prices of vegetables. The headline CPI inflation came below 6 per cent mark in November and December. The \u2018Food and Beverages\u2019 component of CPI registered YOY increase of under 6 per cent in these two months, with CPI for Fuel and Light increasing at double digit rate and CPI excluding food and fuel at or above 6 per cent. The current momentum of the decline in inflation rate remains vulnerable to price changes in one or two commodity groups. Across the main commodity groups within the food sector, a number of them show YOY inflation rate of above 6 per cent. Cereals & products, eggs, milk and products, spices and prepared meals & snacks, accounting for more than half 1 https://www.ncaer.org/BES/NCAER_NSE_BES_Report_January_2023.pdf. the weight of the Food & Beverages group in the CPI, rose at rates above 6 per cent in December 2022. Cereals and products rose at double digit YOY rates during September- December 2022. The Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) conducted by IIM Ahmedabad covering mainly manufacturing firms has reported a decline in the one-year ahead expectation of YOY consumer inflation to 4.91 per cent in December 2022 compared to 5.32 per cent in October 2022. The survey also reports an assessment of the one-year ahead \u2018business inflation\u2019 based on the unit cost, at 4.19 per cent in December 2022 down from 4.70 per cent in October 2022. In both the cases, the expected inflation rates have generally declined in the period June 2022 onwards. 27. The trends in various indicators of level of economic activity point to achieving the FAE of GDP growth of 7 per cent in 2022-23. The weakened global growth conditions on account of tight monetary policy conditions and the continuing Russia-Ukraine war would mean a lower growth of about 6.4 per cent in 2023-24, with a quarterly break up provided in the MPC Resolution. The Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the RBI in January 2023 projects, YOY basis, GDP growth rate of 6.9 per cent for FY 2022-23 and 6.0 per cent for FY 2023-24. 28. The inflation pressures have persisted even with the decline in the headline inflation rate below 6 per cent in November and December 2022. The decline in vegetable prices, main contributor to the moderation in Headline inflation rate, is a seasonal feature, although the correction this time has taken place earlier and is more than the usual fall. The pattern in the several other commodity prices, where the price rise has been sharp, is of concern from a price stability perspective. Moderation in the headline inflation can be expected on a sustained basis only when most of the major components of the index come within the 6 per cent mark. External factors such as international commodity prices are expected to provide relief on the price front; but the pass through of this benefit to the consumer basket will be affected by the exchange rate variations and domestic price setting of petroleum fuels. The headline inflation rate for FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24 is now projected at 6.5 per cent and 5.3 per cent, respectively, with the quarterly break up provided in the MPC Resolution. In comparison, the Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the RBI in January 2023 projects a headline inflation rate of 6.5 per cent for FY 2022-23 and 5.1 per cent for FY 2023-24. 29. Persistence of core inflation at a high level is a crucial concern at this stage. It is important to reduce the demand side pressures on inflation and bring the inflation expectations of the various stake holders closer to the policy target to sustain the growth momentum. 30. In view of the above, I vote (1) to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and also (2) to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 31. Central Banks around the world had to raise rates fast to reverse large pandemic time cuts once inflation rose. But high inflation has not persisted as long as in the seventies so long-run inflation expectations largely remain anchored. Normalization of supply chains, softening commodity prices and falling global demand are bringing inflation down in most countries. US Fed communication on \u2018higher for longer\u2019 independent of data may not be appropriate and has mellowed somewhat. The economy seems to have survived sharp tightening well, as better growth compensated for higher rates. Crashing markets would be a very costly way to get policy transmission. Pressure on emerging market (EM) currencies and inflation from dollar appreciation has reduced. 32. Although global growth prospects have improved, a slowdown continues in advanced economies. Indian exports are showing signs of strain. The Indian PMI new export orders index fell to 51.2 in January from 53.4 in December. PMI has also softened for both manufacturing and services although it remains well above 50. There are still only early signs of a revival in private investment, which has yet to come out of a decade long slowdown. The RBI consumer confidence survey shows while consumer confidence is recovering it is still below 2019 levels. The current account deficit is also decreasing towards sustainable levels. 33. Headline inflation came in below forecasts, although largely driven by a sharp transient fall in vegetable prices. But agriculture seems to have been resilient to prolonged rains, pointing to productivity improvements that augur well for the future also. Diversification away from cereals has made output less volatile. The cereal price shock after the Ukraine war, however, has been a major factor raising Indian inflation. Higher fodder prices are raising milk prices. But wheat prices may also soften with sales from government stocks and expectations of a good harvest. 34. The government has stayed on its announced fiscal consolidation path reducing the government contribution to demand, while expanding supply with its sustained push on infrastructure. It also continues with other supply-side measures to reduce inflation. These enable the excellent monetary-fiscal coordination that has contributed to India\u2019s relative outperformance in a difficult period. It may be time, however, for some more excise tax cuts as multiple supply shocks 35. have imparted persistence to inflation. The large commodity component in India\u2019s consumer price basket, and pockets of supply constraints, respond better to fiscal action. Our government has used such action very effectively in the pandemic period. Inflation still has many administered price components and all regulators need to internalize the inflation target in order for it to be achieved. If inflation remains within its tolerance band the MPC can keep real interest rates low so that growth remains high and contributes to reducing the government debt/GDP ratio. 36. The RBI inflation expectation survey shows household expectation to be highly influenced by events. A pass through of the persistent softening in international oil prices could help to counter adverse effects of global uncertainty and reduce inflation expectations. Oil marketing companies have had ample time to complete cost recovery. 37. Since there are still little signs of wage or demand led second round effects on inflation, however, core may soften over the year. There are signs of the latter in some core components (transport, textiles, and recreation and amusement services). Since firms have benefitted from reduction in international input costs and demand is also slackening they may hesitate to raise prices. The WPI includes firm level prices and WPI inflation has fallen steeply. As the aggressive MPC tightening is more fully passed through it will further reduce demand. The interest elasticity of output is high in India because of a large young population buying flats and equipping them on credit. 38. The real rate is already positive and is likely to become more so, if inflation falls. The RBI\u2019s average inflation forecast for FY 24 of 5.3 per cent gives a real interest rate of almost unity with a repo rate of 6.25 per cent. It can rise above this if inflation comes in below expectations that are based on an oil price of $95, risking a procyclical stance as policy tightens despite pressures on growth. Policy would then have moved away from the nuanced countercyclical stance that has been very effective in smoothing recent external pluri-shocks. Market inflation expectations are below those of the RBI. The Bloomberg consensus forecast is 5 per cent. 39. A real repo rate of around unity suits the current stage of the cycle. It also balances the conflicting requirements of inflation and growth, savers and borrowers well. It ensures nominal rates rise with expected inflation as is required in inflation targeting but prevents large nominal volatility. Research shows it is better to limit volatility so that real interest and exchange rates, that impact the real sector, do not deviate much from their equilibrium values2. Some volatility of nominal rates is good for financial stability, as long as volatility is limited. 40. The US Fed is expected to over-correct and cut after. But it is only short-term market players who benefit from excess volatility and overshooting of exchange and interest rates, which hurt the real sector as well as those who take market positions based on fundamentals. 41. When the Fed is tightening, interest rates tend to rise more for EMs that have sharp currency depreciation. Intervention in FX markets has lowered rupee volatility and helped maintain independence from the Fed stance. Reserves have also recovered. Fed action is due to large excess demand, tight labour markets and an unprecedented deviation from the inflation target. India does not have these conditions and has the space not to follow the Fed. It also started from higher nominal policy rates. 42. If a sharp rise in the real policy rate, substantially above unity, triggers a shift to a lower trend of private investment and growth, then the sacrifice ratio of disinflation can be very high, as it was in the 2010s3. When such multiple paths exist, over-tightening today does not necessarily improve the future. Inflation can rise over time because supply bottlenecks worsen. 43. Excessive front-loading of rate hikes carries the risk of over-shooting that is best avoided for compelling reasons in the Indian context: First, raising real policy rates to reduce demand has a stronger effect on growth than it does on inflation4. Second, since there are more lags in monetary transmission in India, over-shooting can have persistent deleterious effects here, including instability. Third, macroeconomic stability improves most rapidly if real interest rates are kept smoothly below growth rates and counter external shocks. The Indian economy is well-poised to achieve this combination and to reduce its chronic underemployment. In view of these arguments, I vote for a pause. It is better to give time for possible 44. softening of both inflation and growth and effects of past monetary tightening to play out. I am also in favour of a shift to a neutral stance which is consistent with response in any direction as required depending on the impact of global and domestic factors on 2 Goyal, A. and A.

Policy, and market adjustments, would be based on incoming data and its effect on the future outlook. 45. Much of what I wrote in my December statement remains valid now as well. Rather than repeat those arguments all over again, I will be very brief. In the second half of 2021-22, monetary policy was complacent about inflation, and we are paying the price for that in terms of unacceptably high inflation in 2022-23. In the second half of 2022-23, monetary policy has, in my view, become complacent about growth, and I fervently hope that we do not pay the price for this in terms of unacceptably low growth in 2023-24. I believe that the 25 basis point rate hike approved by the majority of the MPC is 46. not warranted in the current context of diminished inflationary expectations and heightened growth concerns. I therefore vote against this resolution. Turning to the stance, I believe that a repo rate of 6.50% very likely overshoots the 47. policy rate needed to achieve price stability, and further tightening is not desirable. I therefore vote against this resolution also. 48. Besides growing divergence in the pace of policy normalisation across the world, recent monetary policy actions by systemic central banks suggest a dichotomy between the policy actions and the stance. Moreover, while nearly all have hiked rates with a pivot towards smaller quantum of rate hikes, clear forward guidance is missing given the difficulty in forecasting inflation presciently in the backdrop of prevailing uncertainties. Taking cues from tapered rate hikes and dovish tones in the stance, global financial markets have priced in a pause and subsequent rate cuts by major advanced economies in the later part of the year. The persistence of inflation, however, can lead to large repricing of risk with consequent market turmoil. Moreover, financial conditions have eased around much of the globe despite sharp monetary policy tightening, which poses a challenge for central banks.5 Therefore, it will be premature to lower the guard on inflation as the credibility of central banks in fighting inflation has large ramifications for stabilisation of inflation and firm anchoring of inflation expectations. 49. In the Indian context, even though inflation remained below the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent for two consecutive months in November-December 2022, a deep dive into CPI inflation indicates little evidence of a decisive and durable disinflation process. The softening of headline inflation can largely be attributed to the sharp and early seasonal correction in prices of vegetables. Excluding vegetables, both food and headline inflation edged up during November-December 2022. Eight out of 12 food sub- groups, comprising 66 per cent of CPI food basket, registered an increase in inflation in December.6 Core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation edged up above 6.0 per cent while other exclusion-based core inflation measures were in the range of 6.0-6.8 per cent. Trimmed mean measures of inflation and diffusion indices for CPI suggest heightened underlying and generalised inflation pressures across the CPI basket. 5 https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/02/02/looser-financial-conditions-pose-conundrum-for-central-banks. 6 Moreover, five food sub-groups comprising 54 per cent of CPI food basket registered an inflation rate of more than 6 per cent. 50. Our inflation projection is premised on crude prices at US$ 95 per barrel. I believe it is necessary to remain conservative on crude prices and avoid best-case scenarios given the volatile nature of crude prices, progressive opening up of China and continuing war in Europe. Moreover, with retail petrol and diesel prices unchanged, the sensitivity of inflation to crude oil price movements is low in the short term but remain relevant for the external sector. 51. Going forward, inflation is projected to moderate to 5.3 per cent in 2023-24. However, its quarterly path indicates considerable variation due to the large influence of base effects \u2013 especially in Q1:2023-24. There does exist considerable uncertainty to this baseline trajectory. A likely bumper rabi harvest could bring about a softening of food inflation; however, there could be risks emanating from adverse weather events. The trajectory of global commodity prices remains uncertain, even as output price pass- through of pending cost pressures continues, especially in services. This, along with housing component in CPI, needs to be monitored closely, given the stickiness of core inflation at around 6 per cent. 52. On the other hand, I am reasonably convinced about the inherent strength of the Indian economy as reflected in (i) high frequency indicators; (ii) resilient domestic demand; (iii) budgetary focus on capital expenditure; (iv) sound health of corporates and banking sector; (v) improving external sector indicators; and (vi) depth of the financial markets. Moreover, February 2023 has been a defining moment for fiscal monetary coordination, which has been the hallmark during the pandemic. Fiscal expansion through higher expenditures can stimulate or retard growth depending upon the phase of the business cycle and the quality of expenditure.7 The government has continued on the path of fiscal consolidation in the Union Budget 2023-24 by reprioritising expenditure from revenue to capital, which will be growth augmenting through higher multiplier effect of investment over the medium term. Thus, the Union Budget served the macroeconomic objective as well as the inflation targeting mandate of the Reserve Bank. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies at this juncture are likely to give us the optimal macro-economic outlook \u2013 a soft landing for the economy through gradual disinflation amidst resilient growth outcomes. The growth projection of 6.4 per cent for 2023-24 reflects these underlying strengths. The quarterly momentum in the projection of real GDP is now close to that of the pre-COVID decade. 53. In the above context, it will be hasty to ease the vigil against inflation. As noted by Milton Friedman, there is a distinction: \u201c...between a steady inflation, one that proceeds at a more or less constant rate, and an intermittent inflation, one that proceeds by fits and starts...\u201d.8 This crucial difference between \u201csteady inflation\u201d and \u201cintermittent inflation\u201d is paramount while formulating the policy choice. The overly large focus on the recent fall in inflation led by \u201cintermittent inflation\u201d may tempt for an untimely pause in monetary policy action, a costly policy error. The continuously high core inflation points to the persistence in \u201csteady inflation\u201d, which warrants caution. Thus, it will be premature to pause when there are no definitive signs of slowdown in inflation, particularly core inflation. Nevertheless, as the policy rate adjusted for inflation has now turned positive, albeit barely so, there is a case for paring down the pace of rate hike to the usual 25 bps. 7 Report on Currency and Finance, RBI 2021-22. Revenue expenditures have negative multiplier during upturns. 8 Friedman, Milton (1963), Inflation: Causes and Consequences, Bombay: Asia Publishing House, reprinted in, Dollars and Deficits, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1968. 54. These factors call for continuity in policy stance and response, to ensure a decisive and durable moderation in inflation towards the target, while keeping in mind the objective of growth. In view of the above, I vote for a lower rate hike of 25 bps without changing the stance. Going ahead, assessment of the impact of the cumulative rate hikes will become important especially in view of higher policy transmission in a primarily bank- based economy. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 55. Over the year gone by, monetary policy actions have been undertaken and accommodation has been withdrawn to restore price stability. The impact of these actions is beginning to be reflected in the channels of transmission. This provides little comfort though, as barring the pronounced winter easing of vegetables prices, almost every other component of the consumer price index is showing a hardening of price pressures. Statistical and exclusion-based measures of underlying inflation are actually showing an uptick. It is eminently likely that as the cooler weather gives way to summer, vegetable prices will turn up again as they usually do. Households sense this, as revealed in largely unchanged inflation expectations and muted discretionary spends, especially in rural areas. Businesses are accordingly encountering a moderation in sales and revenues. With input cost pressures still being passed through into expenditures, capital spending remains restrained. 56. Hence, the stance of monetary policy will need to remain disinflationary till inflation is returned to target. The Indian economy has demonstrated strength in the face of formidable global adversities and there is positive momentum underlying the steady emergence from the drag of the pandemic and the war. While the full effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity are yet to be seen, increasingly it is becoming evident that inflation is weakening domestic consumption and investment as well as confidence. Combined with the drag on exports due to the retarding effects of slowing global activity, and the expected consolidation of fiscal spending, the prospects for growth in 2023-24 hinge around price stability, anchored inflation expectations and improving supply responses across agriculture, industry and services. 57. Although it seems to have peaked, inflation remains high and, in my view, it is the biggest threat to the macroeconomic outlook. Restoration of price stability \u2013 as statutorily mandated \u2013 will provide a solid foundation for a growth trajectory that actualises India\u2019s potential. Taking into account the height of inflation, current and projected, monetary and financial conditions still reflect some slack, although they are moving into tighter territory with the follow through of recent monetary policy actions. The issue is one of timing. The fight against inflation is complicated by the global outlook. There is some 58. consensus growing around a milder slowdown than earlier feared, although geographical disparities complicate the prognosis. Be that as it may, the outlook for global inflation is turning more uncertain than before. While central banks expect only a stubborn easing, financial markets are betting on a more dramatic downturn as commodity price pressures ease and supply chains improve. Nonetheless, future shocks associated with the war and the pandemic are possible. 59. Turning to the implications for policy, the MPC has to remain committed to its primary mandate. The recent experience has amply demonstrated that low and stable inflation is the credible nominal anchor for a reinvigoration of growth. Moving the policy rate into restrictive territory at a resolute pace has provided the headroom to continue to moderate the order of rate increases. This enables us to assess the impact of our actions carefully while taking into account the risks around the outlook. It also demonstrates the credibility of our actions through carefully calibrated rate changes without any backtracks. In the final analysis, the size and timing of rate changes is the best embodiment of the stance. While keeping in mind the objective of growth, the foot must remain on the brake as we chart our future trajectory. On a pragmatic basis, it is important to at least contain inflation within the tolerance band in 2023-24 as the first milestone to be passed in aligning inflation with the target. Accordingly, I vote for increasing the policy rate by 25 basis points while continuing to withdraw accommodation. 60. The global economic outlook has improved since the December (2022) meeting of the MPC. Inflation in major countries has eased in recent prints but remains significantly above their respective targets. Monetary policy is thus expected to remain in a tightening mode, but there is uncertainty about its trajectory. This is leading to bouts of volatility in global financial markets whose spillovers are posing challenges to emerging market economies. 61. In a world of extreme uncertainty, India is witnessing a conducive environment of macroeconomic stability: the economy remains resilient; inflation has moderated in the past two months to below 6 per cent; fiscal consolidation is gaining traction; current account deficit is showing signs of moderation; forex reserves have improved; and the banking sector remains healthy. The sustained buoyancy in domestic demand, especially private consumption and 62. investment, is driving growth. While weak external demand is a drag on our merchandise exports, growth of remittances and exports of services is robust. Going ahead, the persisting recovery in contact-intensive services and good prospects of rabi production are likely to support urban and rural consumption. The enhanced thrust on capital spending and infrastructure in the Union Budget 2023-24 should bolster manufacturing and investment activity. 63. CPI inflation has moderated primarily due to lower vegetable prices. Core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel), however, is elevated and sticky at around 6 per cent. CPI inflation excluding vegetables has moved higher. Going forward, the baseline projections indicate that headline inflation is likely to moderate to 5.3 per cent in 2023-24. These projections also indicate that the disinflation towards the target rate is likely to be protracted given the stickiness of core inflation at elevated levels. Durability of a disinflation process cannot solely rely on food inflation, given its uncertainty and susceptibility to weather events. Overall, there is considerable uncertainty at this stage on the evolving inflation trajectory due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, global financial market volatility, rising non-oil commodity prices, volatile crude oil prices and also weather-related events. 64. We must, therefore, remain unwavering in our commitment to bring down inflation to ensure a decisive and durable moderation in inflation towards the target of 4 per cent over the medium term, while being mindful of growth. Hence, further calibrated monetary policy action is necessary in the current MPC meeting to keep inflation expectations anchored and break the persistence of core inflation while containing second round effects. I also believe that we should taper the pace of rate hike in view of two considerations: (i) we need to give time for our past policy actions to work through the system; and (ii) it would be premature to pause, lest we are caught off-guard and need to do a catching up later. I, therefore, vote for an increase of 25 basis points in the policy repo rate to 6.50 per cent. This order of rate increase provides space to calibrate future monetary policy actions and stance based on evolving macroeconomic conditions. 65. Our actions have nudged the policy rate adjusted for inflation to positive territory after a while. Liquidity remains in surplus mode, even as the surplus is moderating. The overall monetary and liquidity conditions, therefore, remain accommodative. In such a scenario, it is necessary to persevere with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation to ensure a decisive process of disinflation. Accordingly, I vote for continuing with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. 66. There has been some discussion in the public space about the need to give forward guidance on monetary policy actions. As I have stated on several occasions, it would be inadvisable to provide specific guidance when we are in a tightening cycle and when we are experiencing such extreme uncertainty. The only forward guidance that we can provide is that we will remain vigilant, monitor every incoming information and data, interest of and shall act appropriately strengthening medium-term growth. in ", "file_12": "The forty second meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during April 3, 5 and 6, 2023. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Honorary Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Emeritus Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail the staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (April 6, 2023) decided to: Keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.50 per cent. The standing deposit facility (SDF) rate remains unchanged at 6.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Global economic activity remains resilient amidst the persistence of inflation at elevated levels, turmoil in the banking system in some advanced economies (AEs), tight financial conditions and lingering geopolitical hostilities. Recent financial stability concerns have triggered risk aversion, flights to safety and heightened financial market volatility. Sovereign bond yields fell steeply in March on safe haven demand, reversing the sharp increase in February over aggressive monetary stances and communication. Equity markets have declined since the last MPC meeting and the US dollar has pared its gains. Weakening external demand, spillovers from the banking crisis in some AEs, volatile capital flows and debt distress in certain vulnerable economies weigh on growth prospects. Domestic Economy 7. The second advance estimates (SAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on February 28, 2023 placed India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.0 per cent in 2022-23. Private consumption and public investment were the major drivers of growth. 8. Economic activity remained resilient in Q4. Rabi foodgrains production is expected to increase by 6.2 per cent in 2022-23. The index of industrial production (IIP) expanded by 5.2 per cent in January while the output of eight core industries rose even faster by 8.9 per cent in January and 6.0 per cent in February, indicative of the strength of industrial activity. In the services sector, domestic air passenger traffic, port freight traffic, e-way bills and toll collections posted healthy growth in Q4, while railway freight traffic registered a modest growth. Purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) pointed towards sustained expansion in both manufacturing and services in March. 9. Amongst urban demand indicators, passenger vehicle sales recorded strong growth in February while consumer durables contracted in January. Among rural demand indicators, tractor and two-wheeler sales were robust in February. As regards investment activity, growth in steel consumption and cement output accelerated in February. Merchandise exports and non-oil non-gold imports contracted in February while the strong growth in services exports continued. 10. CPI headline inflation rose from 5.7 per cent in December 2022 to 6.4 per cent in February 2023 on the back of higher inflation in cereals, milk and fruits and slower deflation in vegetables prices. Fuel inflation remained elevated, though some softening was witnessed in February due to a fall in kerosene (PDS) prices and favourable base effects. Core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) remained elevated and was above 6 per cent in January-February. The moderation observed in inflation in clothing and footwear, and transportation and communication was largely offset by a pick-up in inflation in personal care and effects and housing. 11. The average daily absorption under the LAF moderated to \u20b91.4 lakh crore during February-March from an average of \u20b91.6 lakh crore in December-January. During 2022-23, money supply (M3) expanded by 9.0 per cent and non-food bank credit rose by 15.4 per cent. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 578.4 billion as on March 31, 2023. Outlook 12. The inflation trajectory for 2023-24 would be shaped by both domestic and global factors. The expectation of a record rabi foodgrains production bodes well for the food prices outlook. The impact of recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms, however, needs to be watched. Milk prices could remain firm due to high input costs and seasonal factors. Crude oil prices outlook is subject to high uncertainty. Global financial market volatility has surged, with potential upsides for imported inflation risks. Easing cost conditions are leading to some moderation in the pace of output price increases in manufacturing and services, as indicated by the Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys. The lagged pass- through of input costs could, however, keep core inflation elevated. Taking into account these factors and assuming an annual average crude oil price (Indian basket) of US$ 85 per barrel and a normal monsoon, CPI inflation is projected at 5.2 per cent for 2023-24, with Q1 at 5.1 per cent, Q2 at 5.4 per cent, Q3 at 5.4 per cent and Q4 at 5.2 per cent, and risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). 13. A good rabi crop should strengthen rural demand, while the sustained buoyancy in contact-intensive services should support urban demand. The government\u2019s thrust on capital expenditure, above trend capacity utilisation in manufacturing, double digit credit growth and the moderation in commodity prices are expected to bolster manufacturing and investment activity. According to the RBI\u2019s surveys, businesses and consumers are optimistic about the future outlook. The external demand drag could accentuate, given slowing global trade and output. Protracted geopolitical tensions, tight global financial conditions and global financial market volatility pose risks to the outlook. Taking all these factors into consideration, real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent with Q1:2023-24 at 7.8 per cent; Q2 at 6.2 per cent; Q3 at 6.1 per cent; and Q4 at 5.9 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). 14. With CPI headline inflation ruling persistently above the tolerance band, the MPC decided to remain resolutely focused on aligning inflation with the target. It is essential to rein in the generalisation of price pressures and anchor inflation expectations. An environment of low and stable prices is necessary for the resilience in domestic economic activity to be sustained. While the policy rate has been increased by a cumulative 250 basis points since May 2022, which is still working through the system, there can be no room for letting down the guard on price stability. Taking these factors into account, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent in this meeting, with readiness to act, should the situation so warrant. The MPC will continue to keep a strong vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook and will not hesitate to take further action as may be required in its future meetings. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 15. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. 16. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Rajiv Ranjan, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on April 20, 2023. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during June 6-8, 2023. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate at 6.50 per cent 19. The Second Advance Estimates (SAE) of the National Income for FY 2022-23 released by the National Statistical Office have retained the overall YOY growth of GDP at constant prices at 7 per cent as provided in the First Advance Estimates (FAE) published on January 6, 2023. However, the Provisional Estimates have been replaced by the First Revised Estimates (FRE) for 2021-22 as the base and the estimated GDP for 2022-23 is now actually higher by 1.3 per cent in the SAE than in FAE. Private Final Consumption expenditure, Gross Fixed Investment expenditure and exports of goods and services growth rates in FY 2022-23 have exceeded the growth rate of overall GDP. Slower growth of Government Final Consumption expenditure and higher imports have offset the higher pace of growth of other demand components. 20. While the overall GDP growth reflects the resilience of the economy, a large part of this strength is contributed by the sharp increase in the first quarter of the year, a reflection of the rebound from the sharp COVID-19 impact of Q1 FY 2020-21. The YOY growth rate of GDP in Q1: 2022-23 is now placed at 13.2 per cent and the growth in the subsequent two quarters at 6.3 and 4.4 per cent. At the sectoral level, the growth drivers are the contact intensive Trade, Hotels, Transport, Communication and Services related to Broadcasting; Electricity, Water Supply and Other utilities; and Construction, which have registered higher YOY growth rates of Gross Value Added compared to the overall GVA growth rate of 6.6 per cent for FY 2022-23. Growth rate of the GVA of Manufacturing in FY 2022-23 is less than 1 per cent. The growth performance, therefore, points to both uneven growth across production sectors and subdued growth in the more recent quarters of FY 2022-23. 21. The weak global economic environment is marked by decelerating demand and uncertainty in the financial markets and energy markets. Some of the weakening demand conditions are due to the monetary policy tightening in the major advanced economies and the slower pace of growth in China. The financial market uncertainty is both due to the slowing global growth, monetary policy actions to bring down high inflation rates and the continued year-long Ukraine war impacting a range of markets including energy. These conditions are expected to prevail at least until the inflation rates moderate significantly. Both IMF and the World Bank have projected World Output YOY growth rates of less than 3 per cent in 2023 and marginally above 3 per cent in 2024. The drag on India\u2019s exports - particularly goods exports - due to these adverse global demand conditions is, therefore, expected to prevail in FY 2023-24. 22. Several factors are in play in determining the domestic output growth conditions in the short-term. The dynamics of high frequency indicators points to continuation of the present growth momentum. For example, the PMI for manufacturing and Services in March have continued to reflect an expansionary phase, although both are below their recent peaks. The GST collections and Railway freight traffic indicator show moderation in YOY growth in Q3: FY 2022-23 and the recent months of January-February 2023. Non-food credit growth, however, continued expansion at double digit rates. The sales growth data for the corporate sector, indicates price rise is an important driver of revenue growth in Q3: FY 2022-23. 23. The business outlook sentiments show a mixed picture. RBI\u2019s survey of enterprises conducted during January-March 2023 points to a moderation of its Business Expectations index for the manufacturing sector firms in Q1: FY 2023-24, although the Business Assessment Index for the prevailing conditions moved up in Q4: FY 2022-23. Both the indices indicate an expansion of economic activities. Expectations of the overall business situation indicate rising optimism through Q1: FY 2023-24 to Q3: 2023-24 in the case of enterprises in the services and infrastructure sectors. Improvement in profit margins is expected by markedly smaller proportion of manufacturing enterprises in Q1: FY 2023-24 compared to Q4: FY 2022-23 than the enterprises in services and infrastructure. Increase in selling prices appears to be necessary to drive improvement in profit margin. The survey of Consumer Confidence for March 2023 points to expectations of improved conditions for employment over the expectations held in the previous round of the survey, with a marginal decline in sentiments on general economic conditions and household income. In all the three indicators of perceptions of the economy, one-year ahead situation is seen to be substantially superior to the present. 24. The estimates of GDP growth (YOY), for FY: 2023-24 provided by a number of agencies in the period from January 2023 onwards, have been around 6 per cent. The RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in March 2023 provides a median forecast of 6.0 per cent for 2023-24. Taking into account the growth trends and factors influencing growth along with an assumption of a normal monsoon for 2023 the GDP growth for FY 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent with quarterly break up of Q1 at 7.8 per cent, Q2 at 6.2 per cent, Q3 at 6.1 per cent and Q4 at 5.9 per cent. The key concern on the growth front in the immediate future is the drag caused by the weak external demand conditions. The impact of any adverse weather conditions on Indian agriculture provides additional downside risk to the growth trajectory. 25. The headline Consumer price index rose by 6.5 and 6.4 per cent in January and February 2023, respectively, breaching the upper limit of the tolerance band of the policy target of 4% inflation, after two months of below 6 per cent inflation rate in November and December 2022. The key drivers of this high level of overall inflation rate in the recent two months were food items, particularly, cereals, milk and products, spices and \u2018prepared meals, snacks and sweets\u2019. However, the inflation rate of the category comprising of items excluding food and fuel, and light has also remained at or above 6 per cent in the first two months of the present calendar year. Among the components of the core inflation which exclude food and fuel items, price rise was well above 6 per cent in the case of Clothing & Footwear, Household Goods & Services, Health and Personal care & effects. Fuel & light has also been at close to double digit inflation rate in the first 11 months of FY 2022-23. A positive feature of the overall inflation trend is a decline in the month-to-month momentum, decelerating in February 2023. This development needs to be watched as the seasonal patterns may begin to reverse this pattern. The combined impact of decelerating international commodity prices, significant 26. monetary policy rate increases since May 2022 leading to higher bank deposit and lending rates is yet to translate into inflation rates below the upper tolerance band of the target in a sustained manner. There are significant downside risks to output growth momentum and gains from price led revenues for the firms may be limited. While policy rate increases were effected over a period of May 2022 to February 2023, the cumulative impact of these policy actions is yet to be realised. The recent Inflation Expectations Survey of Households by the RBI, points to expectations of reduction in inflation rate 3- months ahead and one-year ahead. The survey of firms by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad points to reduction in the one-year ahead expected business inflation based on a cost-based Business Inflation Index in February 2023 compared to January 2023. The survey also finds a marginal increase in the one-year ahead expectations of CPI inflation in February 2023 as compared to the expectations in December 2022, with expectations of YOY inflation rates in both the rounds below 5 per cent1. The forecast for FY 2023-24 points to a reduction in inflation rate below the upper 27. tolerance band of 6 per cent with Q1 at 5.1 per cent, Q2 and Q3 at 5.4 per cent, Q4 at 5.2 per cent and an annual average rate of 5.2 per cent. The decline in projected inflation rates is also supported by the base effect of high inflation rate in FY 2022-23. 28. While these projections point to a path towards achieving the inflation target in the medium term, there are clearly upside risks associated with these projections. The weather uncertainty affecting key agricultural prices globally and in the domestic markets, higher fuel and energy prices due to the supply disruptions resulting from geo-political conflicts and policies may lead to spikes in inflation rate and reversal of these shocks also may not be quick. In this context, it is important to assess the extent of the impact of monetary policy actions on inflation rate, besides the other developments. 29. Taking into account the projected patterns of growth and inflation for FY 2023-24, the risks attached to these projections and a need to watch the cumulative impact of the monetary policy actions so far, I believe that a pause in the policy rates is appropriate in this meeting, without any commitments on the subsequent actions except that aligning the inflation rate with the target will remain a policy priority. 30. Accordingly I vote: (a) to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, and (b) to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. 31. The global slowdown is turning out to be less severe than expected but there are signs of a slowing in both growth and inflation suggesting central banks (CBs) tightening is adequate and lagged effects will bring about the required further fall in inflation. But as financial stress materialized in some advanced economies (AEs), as was to be expected with sharp tightening following sustained excess liquidity, the major CBs had to continue to tighten to demonstrate absence of financial dominance. Fortunately, India had financial deleveraging prior to the pandemic, much stronger and more broad-based regulation and supervision, as well as ongoing focus on corporate governance, so its financial sector has actually outperformed under pluri-shocks2. Continued regulatory vigilance is essential, but it is not necessary to demonstrate independence from financial dominance 1 https://www.iima.ac.in/sites/default/files/2023-04/February%202023%20results.pdf. 2 Goyal, A. 2023. 'Lessons from Outperformance in the Indian Financial Sector.' IGIDR Working paper no. WP-2023-002. Available at: http://www.igidr.ac.in/pdf/publication/WP-2023-002.pdf. here. Instead, India\u2019s better policies and buffers make it possible to demonstrate independence from AE CBs and their weaknesses. Inflation here is also different. It is relatively close to target\u2014excess demand due to over-stimulus or second round effects due to a tight labour market are not driving it. Although growth is resilient, there are signs of slowdown in some high frequency 32. data. Softening non-oil non-gold imports point to weakness in domestic demand; slowing exports are affecting manufacturing; rising loan rates are reducing demand for low income housing. 33. A 2012 RBI working paper3 found monetary policy impacts output with a lag of 2-3 quarters and inflation with a lag of 3-4 quarters with the impact persisting for 8-10 quarters. The interest rate channel accounted for about half of the total impact of monetary shocks on output growth and about one-third of the total impact on inflation. Its effect on output was 2-3 times greater than that on inflation. Exchange rate changes had an insignificant impact on output growth, but a non-negligible impact on inflation. Many time series estimations before and since then had a similar pattern of results. A recent IGIDR M.Phil. on monetary transmission, using current data, also analysed GDP components and found monetary policy had the largest impact on investment through falling equity prices4. 34. By October 2022 the repo rate had risen to a material level (5.9%) with liquidity also tightening and spreads rising for many short-term market instruments. And we see some growth softening two quarters later. The lagged effects of the rate rise are just beginning, and may continue to play out over the next few months. Those on inflation will follow. 35. But the estimations above do not include the expectations channel of monetary policy transmission. To the extent policy rates rise with inflation and clear communication on the inflation target anchors inflation expectations, and there is evidence for this5, the interest rate channel does not have to carry the entire burden of adjustment. Inflation will fall faster and the growth sacrifice required to reach the inflation target is lower. This is more so if supply-side action is also reducing inflation. Such policy is part of the BCCR approach\u2014balanced, countercyclical policy with good coordination across fiscal and monetary policy and continuing reform, which has helped make India a bright spot in a gloomy global macroeconomic scene. Inflation is expected to come down over the year. There is the base effect but 36. momentum is also slowing in some consumer goods. The RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys shows firms expect inputs costs and selling prices to moderate. The exchange rate is stable or strengthening. The weightage issue that raised cereal prices sharply in the past 2 months is expected to have a reverse effect as market prices fall. 37. Since the inflation forecast for FY24 is 5.2% with Q4 at 5.2%, a repo rate at 6.5% implies the real policy rate is greater than one. It has already tightened enough to progressively bring inflation towards the target of 4%, with other complementary policies 3 Khundrakpam, J. K. and R. Jain. 2012. \u2018Monetary Policy Transmission in India: A Peep inside the Black Box\u2019, RBI working paper series no. 11. Available at https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=14326. 4 Mogor, B. 2023. \u2018Relative Effectiveness of Monetary Policy Transmission Channels: Evidence from India\u2019, IGIDR M.Phil. dissertation, 31st March. 5 Goyal, A. and Parab, P. 2023. 'Working of Expectations Channel of Monetary Policy in India.' Journal of International Commerce, Economics and Policy, 14(1): 1-38. and barring major new shocks. A further rise in real interest rates is best avoided at present since high real rates can trigger a non-linear switch to a low growth path6. 38. There is no logic for overshooting policy rates and then cutting in a country such as India where the largest impact of the interest rate is on growth, the relation between expected rupee depreciation and interest rates is weak, many tools are available to reduce excess volatility of the exchange rate and have been successfully used, the current account deficit has reduced and its financing is no longer an issue. Moreover, the exchange rate is not directly included in the mandate of the MPC. 39. In view of these arguments, I vote for a pause. But because of erratic weather and continuing global uncertainties, and until it is clear that inflation is well on the path to reaching the target, it is necessary to emphasize that this may not be the end of the rate hikes. So I also vote for withdrawal of accommodation as the stance. But this stance is now with respect to the repo rate, so it is consistent with the injection of durable liquidity if shocks are so large that LAF instruments prove inadequate. Major CBs have allowed their balance sheets to expand as required for other reasons, while at the same time raising repo rates for monetary policy purposes. Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma 40. Two inflationary risks have come to the fore since the February meeting. The first risk emanates from the announcement of an output cut by OPEC+ during the weekend just before the MPC meeting. Crude oil promptly reversed the entire price decline of the preceding weeks and settled slightly above the levels prevailing at the February meeting. The output cut by itself is not worrying as it could simply represent an attempt by OPEC+ to match supply to sluggish demand in a slowing global economy. It would become a matter of concern only if it signals a structural change in the geopolitical alignment of the major oil producing countries. So far, the crude oil market has been relaxed about this development with the futures curve continuing to slope downward. Nevertheless, the MPC needs to keep a careful watch on this evolving situation. If crude were to creep towards the triple digit mark, there might be a need for a monetary response. 41. The second risk relates to the monsoon. It is only around mid April that scientists are able to provide monsoon forecasts with some degree of confidence, and the forecast accuracy improves towards the end of May. In this meeting, therefore, the MPC has no choice but to operate under the default assumption of a normal monsoon. However, in increasing concern about some unfavourable recent weeks, oceanographic patterns that could impact the monsoon this year. A deficient monsoon would likely create inflationary pressures that would need to be counteracted with monetary policy measures. We will however have to wait till May or even early June to have reasonable clarity on this matter. there has been 42. On the growth front, early warning signs of a possible slowdown are visible to a greater extent than in February. In the current situation of high inflation, monetary policy does not have the luxury of responding to these growth headwinds. In fact, it is almost axiomatic that monetary action can cool inflation only by suppressing demand. However, policy makers must be vigilant against overshooting the terminal policy rate, and thereby slowing the economy to a greater extent than what is needed to glide inflation to the target. 6 Goyal, A. and A. Kumar. 2018. \u2018Active Monetary Policy and the Slowdown: Evidence from DSGE based Indian Aggregate Demand and Supply\u2019. The Journal of Economic Asymmetries. 17: 21-40. June. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeca.2018.01.001. 43. The balance of risks has, in my view, shifted slightly towards inflation since the February meeting, but the best estimate currently is that the 315 basis points of effective tightening of the overnight interest rate (from a reverse repo rate of 3.35% to a repo rate of 6.50%) would be quite sufficient to bring inflation under control. Therefore, I vote in favour of keeping the policy rate unchanged in this meeting. 44. Turning to the stance, I must confess that I fail to comprehend its meaning. My colleagues in the MPC assure me that the language is crystal clear to market participants and others. It may well be that I am the only person who finds it hard to understand. But I am unable to reconcile the language of the stance with the simple fact that no further \u201cwithdrawal of accommodation\u201d remains to be done since the repo rate has already been raised to the 6.50% level prevailing at the beginning of the previous easing cycle in February 2019. It is of course possible to undertake further tightening, but that would not constitute a \u201cwithdrawal of accommodation\u201d by any stretch of the imagination. 45. One interpretation that has been offered is that the real interest rate measured using the most recent published inflation rate needs to rise further. This is doubtless true, but monetary policy should not be conducted by looking at the rear view mirror. The real interest rate must be measured against the projected inflation rate 3-4 quarters ahead, and, as things stand right now, there is very little ground to argue for a further rise in the correctly measured real interest rate. Moreover, even if a flawed definition of the real interest rate is accepted, the projected rise in this real rate would not require any action by the MPC; it would happen as a mechanical result of a falling inflation rate and an unchanged policy rate. And the projected fall in the inflation rate would be a consequence of what the MPC has already done, and not what it will do in coming months. I cannot put my name to a stance that I do not even understand. At the same time, 46. it is clear that the war against inflation has not yet been won, and it would be premature to declare an end to this tightening cycle. There is need for heightened vigilance in the face of the fresh risks that I highlighted earlier in my statement. For these reasons, I refrain from dissenting on this part of the resolution, and confine myself to expressing reservations on it. 47. Let me begin from where I ended my last minutes of February 2023: \u201cGoing ahead, assessment of the impact of the cumulative rate hikes will become important especially in view of higher policy transmission in a primarily bank-based economy\u201d. Consistent with that assessment and in the wake of new information that has since become available, I vote for a pause in today\u2019s meeting. First, the crosscurrents of uncertainty continue to sweep across the globe. The 48. challenges faced in recent times have raised important questions about the conduct of monetary policy under heightened uncertainty. The gradient of unpredictability in the economy runs deeper from quantifiable risks in the near term to unknowable Knightian uncertainty (Knight, 1921)7 over longer time horizons. Faced with these uncertainties, the \u2018science\u2019 of monetary policy \u2013 which is premised on a forward-looking and a rule-based approach (Clarida, Gali, and Gertler, 1999)8 \u2013 must be blended with the \u2018art\u2019 of monetary policy, which is data-centric and based on prudent judgement of policymakers. A virtuous guide to policymaking in such times is to tread cautiously (Orphanides, 2003).9 As the then President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, put it, \u201cin a dark room you move with tiny steps.\u201d10 I believe we are currently poised appropriately at this juncture to pause in the backdrop front-loaded rate actions even as monetary policy remains finely calibrated to the domestic and global situation. 49. Second, there are some clear positive signals visible on the domestic front. Inflationary expectations are gradually easing, domestic growth momentum remains robust, and India, so far, is insulated from the global banking crisis. 50. Third, it is important to keep in mind that there was considerable noise in the high inflation readings of January-February 2023 attributed to the statistical effect with respect to treatment of cereals.11 51. Fourth, though inflation at present remains above the comfort zone, there are reasons for optimism going forward. The heat wave of February and the unseasonal rains of March are expected to have only some localised impacts, raising the prospects of an overall good rabi harvest. High frequency food price indicators for the month of March are already indicating a decline in wheat prices. Furthermore, international food prices have registered a decline of around 19 per cent in February 2023 from its peak in March 2022, which could help lower costs for critical import dependent food items through appropriate trade policies. Global metals and industrial input prices have also seen significant correction from their March 2022 peak levels which could likely result in softening of core inflation pressures over the year, though in a protracted manner. The key factors that could adversely affect the inflation trajectory over 2023-24 are climate related, structural demand-supply imbalance in important food items such as milk and volatile crude oil prices. At present, there is considerable uncertainty on how these events will play out over the year; hence, a wait and watch approach may be a better strategy. 52. Fifth, though core CPI inflation (excluding food and fuel) continued to remain sticky and elevated, there are signs of a modest softening in February, which was also observed across various other exclusion as well as trimmed mean measures of underlying inflation. The month-over-month (MoM) seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of core CPI has also slowed down from around 6 per cent in December 2022 to around 5 per cent in February 2023. Moreover, headline CPI diffusion indices for February, though indicating an expansion of prices, also showed that for the first time since July 2022, a significant majority the CPI basket registered price increases of less than 6 per cent (SAAR). Diffusion indices for a core CPI which also excludes petrol, diesel, gold and silver have also indicated price expansion at rates lower than 6 per cent (SAAR) since November 2022. Softer household inflation expectations revealed by RBI\u2019s latest survey provides comfort that second order effects on inflation will also remain subdued. 9 Orphanides, A. (2003). Monetary policy evaluation with noisy information. Journal of Monetary economics, 50(3), 605-631. 10 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2019/html/ecb.is190307~de1fdbd0b0.en.html 11 Since January 2023, states where prices of rice and wheat under public distribution system (PDS) was reduced to zero, there was redistribution of CPI weights of these zero priced PDS items to other items in the cereals group. The higher weightage to such market priced items, amidst rising market prices, pushed up sharply the published inflation rate in cereals (Das, P. and A. T. George (2023), Consumer Price Index: The Aggregation Method Matters, Reserve Bank of India Bulletin, March). 53. Sixth, new incoming information suggests that the growth outlook for 2023-24 has improved with investment revival likely to become more entrenched along with a lesser drag from external demand. The government\u2019s sustained focus on infrastructure spending will also crowd in private investment and support growth.12 54. Seventh, during the last one year of monetary policy normalisation, the operating target of monetary policy is up by around 320 basis points, the effects of which are yet to be fully transmitted to domestic macroeconomic aggregates. In the backdrop of increasing depth and liquidity in financial markets, the long and variables lags of monetary policy may have shortened in recent years, supported by complementary tools of better communication, forward guidance and balance sheet policies. The shift to external benchmark lending rate (EBLR) is an additional factor that has hastened the speed of transmission. Under these conditions, monetary policy tightening needs to be calibrated judiciously. 55. Eighth, real policy rates whether ex ante, or ex post, whether based on headline or core inflation, are now positive and expected to increase further given our projected inflation path.13 56. Notwithstanding this, let me state that this is a \u2018wait and watch\u2019 pause. It is neither a \u2018premature\u2019 pause nor a \u2018permanent\u2019 one. Not \u2018premature\u2019 because we have already increased policy rate by 250 bps in about a year with frontloaded rate action of about 190 bps during the first 5 months. Not \u2018permanent\u2019 as any durable decline in inflation towards the target of 4 per cent is still distant.14 Therefore, I vote to continue with our stance of withdrawal of accommodation. The inherent strength and resilience of the Indian economy with inflation expected to moderate going forward inspires confidence of our actions. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra The momentum of economic activity in India is broadening, and slack is being 57. pulled in. The underlying price build-up indicates that demand pressures remain strong, especially inflation remains elevated and generalised; and, as I stated at the time of the MPC\u2019s February 2023 meeting, it is the biggest risk to the outlook for the Indian economy. 58. The lessons of experience and empirical evidence show incontrovertibly that inflation ruling above 6 per cent \u2013 as it has done through 2022-23 \u2013 is inimically harmful for growth. This is already showing up in the deceleration of private consumption spending and the moderation in sales growth in the corporate sector which, in turn, is hamstringing new investment. In my view, the baseline projection for real GDP growth at 6.5 per cent for 2023-24 will benefit from an upside from budgeted capital expenditure; this advantage should not, however, be frittered away by inflation. By current reckoning, the future path of inflation is vulnerable to several supply shocks. The MPC must accordingly remain on high alert and ready to act pre-emptively if risks intensify to both sides of its commitment: price stability and growth. 12 Public investment multiplier on private investment and real GDP is found well over unity at 1.2 and 1.7, respectively, over a three- year period [Monetary Policy Report (MPR), April 2023]. 13 Please refer my February 2023 minutes, \u2026 small positive real rates had given adequate reasoning for paring down rate hikes though not enough to pause. 14 Inflation forecast is at 5.2 per cent even by end-quarter of 2023-24. Moreover, average for 2024-25 is at 4.5 per cent as per MPR April 2023. 59. Monetary policy must persevere with the withdrawal of accommodation. The stance of policy has to remain disinflationary and unwavering in its resolve to align inflation with the target of 4 per cent. It is prudent to anticipate future shocks to the inflation trajectory while evaluating the cumulative tightening of monetary policy so far. Bank credit growth is already reflecting the pass-through of past monetary policy actions, although it remains robust relative to the pace of underlying activity in the economy, and financial conditions more generally are supportive of growth. 60. While I vote for a pause in this meeting, an ongoing assessment of the macroeconomic outlook should inform a preparedness to re-calibrate monetary policy towards a more restrictive stance with consistent actions, should risks to the inflation trajectory materialise and impede its alignment with the target. The process of getting inflation back to target could turn out to be gradual and uneven, but the mission of monetary policy is to shepherd this process through potential bumps while containing second round effects and anchoring inflation expectations. Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 61. Since the last meeting of the MPC in February 2023, the global economic environment has changed dramatically. While issues of geopolitics and high inflation continue to impact the outlook, the emergence of banking sector turmoil on both sides of the Atlantic and the sudden announcement of oil production cut by the OPEC+ countries have rendered the global outlook even more uncertain. Global inflation is easing but at a tardy pace. Central banks face a runway which is becoming narrower and bumpy for soft- landing. 62. Against this background, inflation in India during January-February 2023 exceeded the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent after a transitory respite during November- December 2022. Going forward, inflation projection for 2023-24 is indicating a moderation to an average of 5.2 per cent. Both domestic as well as global factors are expected to bring about this disinflation. There is better optimism on rabi harvest despite the recent unseasonal rains. This could significantly reduce price pressures on rabi food crops, particularly wheat. Further, prices of edible oils have moderated. The softening of global commodity prices from their peak levels a year ago is translating into lower input cost pressures for manufactured goods and services. These could result in some softening of core inflation going forward. The overall situation, nonetheless, remains dynamic and fast evolving. Clarity on monsoon would be available in the coming months. Milk prices may remain firm in the lean summer season on tight demand-supply balance and high fodder costs. The rising uncertainty in international crude oil prices also warrants close monitoring. 63. In parallel, domestic growth impulses remained buoyant in Q4:2022-23. Looking ahead, the thrust on infrastructure spending by the government would support investment activity. The drag from net external demand is moderating. Overall, broadening of economic activity and the strength of the external sector have allowed us room to remain steadfastly focused on inflation. 64. We have consecutively raised the policy repo rate by 250 basis points since May 2022 when we started the current rate hike cycle. Together with the introduction of the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) at a rate 40 basis points above the fixed rate reverse repo rate, the effective rate hike has been 290 basis points. In tandem, our market operations have reined in surplus liquidity in an orderly manner. These actions have collectively transmitted into the weighted average call money rate (WACR), the operating target of monetary policy, along with other short-term rates. The cumulative impact of our monetary policy actions over the last one year is still 65. unfolding and needs to be monitored closely. Inflation for 2023-24 is projected to soften, but the disinflation towards the target is likely to be slow and protracted. The projected inflation in Q4:2023-24 at 5.2 per cent would still be well above the target. Therefore, at this juncture, we have to persevere with our focus on bringing about a durable moderation in inflation and at the same time give ourselves some time to monitor the impact of our past actions. I am, therefore, of the view that we do a tactical pause in this meeting of the MPC. Accordingly, I vote for a pause in rate action and for remaining focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. This is a tactical pause and not a pivot or a change in policy direction. We will continue to monitor all incoming information and undertake forward-looking assessment of the evolving economic outlook and stand ready to act, should the situation so warrant. Our fight against inflation is far from over and we have to continue with our efforts to bring down inflation closer to the target over the medium term. "}
