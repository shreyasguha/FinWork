{"file1": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily one-day term repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. 2. Since the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of September 2014, the global economy has slowed, though the recent sharp fall in crude prices will have a net positive impact on global growth. The recovery in the United States is broadening on the back of stronger domestic consumption, rising investment and industrial activity. In the Euro area, headwinds from recessionary forces continue to weaken industrial production and investment sentiment. In Japan, growth may be picking up again on the back of stronger exports, helped in part by further quantitative and qualitative easing that has led to a depreciation of the yen. In China, disappointing activity and still-low inflation have prompted rate cuts by the People\u2019s Bank of China. In other major emerging market economies (EMEs), downside risks to growth from elevated inflation, low commodity prices, deteriorating labour market conditions and stalling domestic demand have become accentuated. 1 3. Notwithstanding the cessation of asset purchases by the US Fed, financial markets have remained generally buoyant on abundant liquidity stemming from accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies (AEs). The search for yield has driven global equity markets to new highs, with investors shunning gold and commodities. Capital flows to EMEs recovered from market turbulence in the first half of October, although some discrimination on the basis of fundamentals is becoming discernible. Assessment of the Indian Economy 4. Domestic activity weakened in Q2 of 2014-15, and activity is likely to be muted in Q3 also because of a moderate kharif harvest. The deficiency in the north- east monsoon rainfall has constrained the pace of rabi sowing, except in the southern States. Despite reasonable levels of water storage in major reservoirs, the rabi crop is unlikely to compensate for the decline in kharif production earlier in the year and consequently, agricultural growth in 2014-15 is likely to be muted. This, along with a slowdown in rural wage growth, is weighing on rural consumption demand. 5. Despite the uptick in September, the growth of industrial production slumped to 1.1 per cent in Q2 with negative momentum in September, unable to sustain the improvement recorded in the preceding quarter. The persisting contraction in the production of both capital goods and consumer goods in Q2 reflected weak aggregate domestic demand. However, more recent readings of core sector activity, automobile sales and purchasing managers\u2019 indices suggest improvement in likely activity. Exports have buffered the slowdown in industrial activity in Q2 but, going forward, require support from partner country growth. 6. In the services sector, the October\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 survey indicates deceleration in new business. In contrast, tourist arrivals and domestic and international cargo movements have shown improvement. Thus, various constituents of the services sector are emitting mixed signals. A rise in investment is critical for a sustained pick-up in overall economic 7. activity. While low capacity utilisation in some sectors is a dampener, the recent strong improvement in business confidence and in investment intentions should help. In this context, the still slow pace of reviving stalled projects, despite government efforts, warrants policy priority, even as ongoing efforts to ease stress in the financial system unlock resources for financing the envisaged investment push. 8. The fiscal outlook should brighten because of the fall in crude prices, but weak tax revenue growth and the slow pace of disinvestment suggest some uncertainty about the likely achievement of fiscal targets, and the quality of eventual fiscal adjustment. The government, however, appears determined to stay on course. Retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), has 9. decelerated sharply since the fourth bi-monthly statement of September. This reflects, to some extent, transitory factors such as favourable base effects and the usual softening of fruits and vegetable prices that occurs at this time of the year. On the other hand, protein-rich items such as milk and pulses continue to experience upside pressures, reflecting structural mismatches in supply and demand. The absence of adequate administered price revisions in inputs like electricity has contributed to the easing of inflation in the fuel group. 10. In the non-food non-fuel category, inflation eased broadly in September. Further softening of international crude prices in October eased price pressures in transport and communication. However, upside pressures persist in respect of prices of clothing and bedding, housing and other miscellaneous services, resulting in non-food non-fuel inflation for October remaining flat at its level in the previous month, and above headline inflation. Survey-based inflationary expectations have been coming down with the fall in prices of commonly-bought items such as vegetables, but are still in the low double digits. Administered price corrections, as and when they are effected, weaker-than-anticipated agricultural production, and a possible rise in energy prices on the back of geo-political risks could alter the currently benign inflation outlook significantly. Liquidity conditions have eased considerably in Q3 of 2014-15 due to 11. structural and frictional factors, as well as the fine tuning of the liquidity adjustment framework. With deposit mobilisation outpacing credit growth and currency demand remaining subdued in relation to past trends, banks are flush with funds, leading a number of banks to reduce deposit rates. The main frictional source of liquidity has been the large release of expenditure/transfers by the government. In view of abundant liquidity, banks\u2019 recourse to the Reserve Bank for liquidity through net fixed and variable rate term and overnight repos and MSF declined from `803 billion, on average, in Q1 to `706 billion in Q2 and further to `476 billion in October- November. The use of export credit refinance also declined from 52.6 per cent of the limit in Q2 to 32.6 per cent in October-November. The revised liquidity management framework introduced in September, has helped the weighted average cut-off rates in the 14-day term repo auctions as well as in the overnight variable rate repo auctions to remain close to the repo rate, and the volatility of the weighted average call rate has fallen, apart from episodes of cash build-up ahead of Diwali holidays. 12. The Reserve Bank determines the need for open market operations (OMO) based on its assessment of monetary conditions rather than on a specific view on long term yields. On an assessment of the permanent liquidity conditions, the Reserve Bank conducted OMO sales worth `401 billion during October to December so far. 13. Merchandise exports declined in October, mainly reflecting sluggish external demand conditions, but also the softening of international prices resulting in lower realisations. For the period April-October as a whole, however, export growth remained positive although the deceleration since July requires vigilance. With import growth remaining modest on account of the decline in POL imports due to falling crude prices, the trade deficit narrowed from its level a year ago. Gold imports have surged since September in volume terms, largely reflecting seasonal demand. Barring month-to-month variations, non-oil non-gold import growth has remained moderate, with anecdotal evidence of imports substituting for shortfalls in domestic production. Even as external financing requirements stay moderate, all categories of capital flows, except non-resident deposits, have been buoyant. The consequent accretion to reserves denominated in US dollars has been moderated by valuation effects resulting from the strength of the US dollar. Policy Stance and Rationale 14. Consistent with the balance of risks set out in the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of September, headline inflation has been receding steadily and current readings are below the January 2015 target of 8 per cent as well as the January 2016 target of 6 per cent. The inflation reading for November \u2013 which will become available by mid-December \u2013 is expected to show a further softening. Thereafter, however, the favourable base effect that is driving down headline inflation will likely dissipate and inflation for December (data release in mid- January) may well rise above current levels. 15. The key uncertainty is the durability of this upturn. The full outcome of the north-east monsoon will determine the intensity of price pressures relating to cereals, oilseeds and pulses, but it is reasonable to expect some firming up of these prices in view of the monsoon\u2019s performance so far and the shortfall estimated for kharif production. Risks from imported inflation appear to be retreating, given the softening of international commodity prices, especially crude, and reasonable stability in the foreign exchange market. Accordingly, the central forecast for CPI inflation is revised down to 6 per cent for March 2015 (Chart 1). 16. Turning to the outlook for inflation in the medium-term, projections at this stage will be contingent upon expectations of a normal south-west monsoon in 2015, international crude prices broadly around current levels and no change in administered prices in the fuel group, barring electricity. Over the next 12-month period, inflation is expected to retain some momentum and hover around 6 per cent, except for seasonal movements, as the disinflation momentum works through. Accordingly, the risks to the January 2016 target of 6 per cent appear evenly balanced under the current policy stance. 17. Some easing of monetary conditions has already taken place. The weighted average call rates as well as long term yields for government and high-quality corporate issuances have moderated substantially since end-August. However, these interest rate impulses have yet to be transmitted by banks into lower lending rates. Indeed, slow bank credit growth is mirrored by increasing reliance of large corporations on commercial paper and domestic as well as external public issuances. 18. Still weak demand and the rapid pace of recent disinflation are factors supporting monetary accommodation. However, the weak transmission by banks of the recent fall in money market rates into lending rates suggests monetary policy shifts will primarily have signaling effects for a while. Nevertheless, these signaling effects are likely to be large because the Reserve Bank has repeatedly indicated that once the monetary policy stance shifts, subsequent policy actions will be consistent with the changed stance. There is still some uncertainty about the evolution of base effects in inflation, the strength of the on-going disinflationary impulses, the pace of change of the public\u2019s inflationary expectations, as well as the success of the government\u2019s efforts to hit deficit targets. A change in the monetary policy stance at the current juncture is premature. However, if the current inflation momentum and changes fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle. inflationary expectations continue, and 19. While activity appears to have lost some momentum in Q2, probably extending into Q3, conditions congenial for a turnaround \u2013 the softening of inflation; easing of commodity prices and input costs; comfortable liquidity conditions; and rising business confidence as well as purchasing activity \u2013 are gathering. These conditions could enable a pick-up in Q4 if coordinated policy efforts fructify in dispelling the drag on the economy emanating from structural constraints. A durable revival of investment demand continues to be held back by infrastructural constraints and lack of assured supply of key inputs, in particular coal, power, land and minerals. The success of ongoing government actions in these areas will be key to reviving growth and offsetting downside risks emanating from agriculture \u2013 in view of weaker-than-expected rabi sowing \u2013 and exports \u2013 given the sluggishness in external demand. Anticipating such success, the central estimate of projected growth for 2014-15 has been retained at 5.5 per cent, with a gradual pick-up in momentum through 2015-16 on the assumption of a normal monsoon and no adverse supply/financial shocks (Chart 2). 20. February 3, 2015. The sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday, ", "file2": "Since July 2014, inflationary pressures (measured by changes in the consumer price index) have been easing. The path of inflation, while below the expected trajectory, has been consistent with the assessment of the balance of risks in the Reserve Bank\u2019s bi-monthly monetary policy statements. To some extent, lower than expected inflation has been enabled by the sharper than expected decline in prices of vegetables and fruits since September, ebbing price pressures in respect of cereals and the large fall in international commodity prices, particularly crude oil. Crude prices, barring geo-political shocks, are expected to remain low over the year. Weak demand conditions have also moderated inflation excluding food and fuel, especially in the reading for December. Finally, the government has reiterated its commitment to adhering to its fiscal deficit target. inflation, These factors have significantly reduced compensating for the widely anticipated ending of favourable base effects. Households\u2019 inflation expectations have adapted, and both near-term and longer-term inflation expectations have eased to single digits for the first time since September 2009. Inflation outcomes have fallen significantly below the 8 per cent targeted by January 2015. On current policy settings, inflation is likely to be below 6 per cent by January 2016. These developments have provided headroom for a shift in the monetary policy stance. It may be recalled that the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of December had stated that \u201cif the current inflation momentum and changes in inflation expectations continue, and fiscal developments are encouraging, a change in the monetary policy stance is likely early next year, including outside the policy review cycle\u201d. In its public interactions, the RBI had committed to initiate the process of monetary easing as soon as data indicated that medium term inflationary targets would be met. Keeping this commitment in mind, it has been decided to: keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank-wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14- day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 8.75 per cent with immediate effect. The fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement also stated that once the monetary policy stance shifts, subsequent policy actions will be consistent with that confirm continuing this stance. Key disinflationary pressures. Also critical would be sustained high quality fiscal consolidation as well as steps to overcome supply constraints and assure availability of key inputs such as power, land, minerals and infrastructure. The latter would be needed to ensure that potential output rises above the projected pick-up in growth in coming quarters so as to contain inflation. to further easing are data We take this opportunity to convey our best wishes to all for Makar Sankranti, Pongal and Uttarayana. ", "file3": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to:  keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 7.75 per cent;  keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL);  reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks by 50 basis points from 22.0 per cent to 21.5 per cent of their NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning February 7, 2015;  replace the export credit refinance (ECR) facility with the provision of system level liquidity with effect from February 7, 2015;  continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos of 0.25 per cent of bank-wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and  continue with daily variable rate term repo and reverse repo auctions to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 8.75 per cent. 2. Since the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of December 2014, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its forecasts for growth in 2015 and 2016 downwards. However, these forecasts are higher than the estimates for 2014. In the United States, growth moderated towards the end of 2014, with the boost to consumption demand from the fall in crude prices more than offset by the drag on net exports from a strong US dollar. In the Euro area, economic conditions have deteriorated in an environment of deflationary pressures, political tensions in Greece and still-elevated levels of unemployment. Demand in Japan is only just beginning to recover from the impact of the consumption tax increase last year, notwithstanding massive monetary and fiscal accommodation. The yen\u2019s depreciation, however, is helping support exports. In China, growth is slowing because of a weakening property market and excess capacity in several industries. This has prompted targeted measures to ease financial constraints faced by corporations and banks. In other emerging market economies (EMEs), growth has weakened sharply for oil exporters, whereas inflationary pressures, subdued investment appetite and a neutral fiscal stance continue to dampen growth in non-oil exporters. 3. The announcement of massive quantitative easing by the European Central Bank (ECB) in late January has reinvigorated financial risk taking, boosting stock markets across the world, even though many market participants have read the softness in crude prices and the ECB\u2019s announcement as signifying a weaker global economic outlook. Along with the growing belief that the US Fed will stay on hold longer than previously thought, bond yields in advanced economies (AEs) have fallen to historic lows. Financial markets remain vulnerable to uncertainty surrounding monetary policy normalization in AEs as well as possibly weaker growth in China and oil exporting EMEs. 4. The revision in the base year for GDP and GDP calculation methods will mean some revision in GDP growth numbers for 2014-15 as well as in GDP forecasts. Domestic activity is likely to have remained subdued in Q3 of 2014-15, mainly reflecting the shortfall in the kharif harvest relative to a year ago. Agricultural growth is likely to pick up in Q4 with the late improvement in the north-east monsoon and in rabi sowing. Nevertheless, growth expectations should be tempered as lead indicators such as tractor and motorcycle sales and slowing rural wage growth all point to subdued rural demand. 5. The improvement in industrial activity in November 2014 was broad-based, but continuing contraction in consumer goods production underscores the persisting weakness in consumption demand (even while raising questions about measurement of production). Advance indicators of industrial activity - indirect tax collections; non- oil non-gold import growth; expansion in order books; and new business reported in purchasing managers surveys - point to a modest improvement in the months ahead. Policy initiatives in land acquisition, as well as efforts underway to unlock mining activity and to widen the space for foreign direct investment in defence, insurance and railways, should create a more conducive setting for industrial revival. Faster clearances are also helping in resuscitating stalled projects. The improvement in business confidence is visible in a pick-up in new investment intentions, especially in transportation, power and manufacturing. 6. In the services sector, the purchasing managers\u2019 survey indicates slower activity, especially in new orders. However, other indicators of the services sector including foreign tourist arrivals, automobile sales, cargo handled at ports, and railway freight traffic suggest improvement. Overall, growth prospects will be contingent upon a turnaround in investment and a durable improvement in the business climate to complement the upsurge in business optimism. The sharp reduction in oil prices as well as in inflation is likely to increase personal disposable incomes and improve domestic demand conditions in the year ahead. Retail inflation, measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price 7. index (CPI), edged up in December on the expected reversal of favourable base effects that had tempered upside pressures since June. A slight softening of cereal prices and a sharp seasonal fall in vegetables prices moderated the trajectory of headline inflation, despite persistent firmness in the prices of protein-rich items such as milk, meat and pulses. However, seasonal increases in vegetable prices, which typically set in around March, have to be monitored carefully. In the fuel category, prices of constituents such as electricity, coal and cooking gas remained stable in the absence of administered revisions. Consequently, the CPI registered a monthly decline for the first time since February 2014. oil prices; and softer commodity prices more generally. Inflation in respect of miscellaneous services and housing, however, declined more moderately. Weak domestic demand has restrained corporates\u2019 pricing power and inflationary pressures in the non-food non-fuel category. Near-term as well as longer-term inflation expectations of households dropped to single digits for the first time in 21 quarters. Benign expectations are also mirrored in surveys of professional forecasters and industry conducted periodically by the Reserve Bank. 9. Active liquidity management operations under the revised framework adopted in early September have ensured that liquidity conditions have generally remained comfortable. Money market rates have evolved in close alignment with the policy repo rate, excluding occasional pressures around days of advance tax outflows and quarter-end tightness. Overnight variable rate repo/reverse repo auctions announced early in the day give markets advance intimation of the Reserve Bank\u2019s assessment on system-wide liquidity needs for the day, allowing fine tuning of liquidity. This also reduces the need for other sector specific windows. The average daily net borrowings under the LAF (including term repos, reverse repos and MSF) have been around ` 850 billion in December and January. 10. Easing inflationary pressures strengthened the impact of comfortable liquidity conditions on market interest rates; sovereign and corporate bond yields declined by 50 basis points and more in Q3. However, despite a generalised fall in the cost of funds, banks have yet to pass through these effects, as also the effects of the policy rate cut on January 15, into the spectrum of lending rates. 11. With the slump in international crude prices taking its toll on exports of petroleum products, and non-oil export growth also decelerating sharply, merchandise exports shrank in Q3 of 2014-15 after two consecutive quarters of growth. Export performance has been hamstrung by weak global demand conditions and the persisting fall in unit value realisations. The real appreciation of the rupee may also have had some effect. The fall in international crude prices translated into a sizable saving on account of POL imports, despite a pick-up in import volumes in Q3. Gold imports also moderated, coming off the seasonal cum pent-up demand spurt in September-November. On the other hand, non-oil non-gold import growth remained firm and in positive territory, extending a run that began in May. Although overall imports declined in December, they recorded an expansion for Q3 as a whole on the back of the earlier rise in gold and non-oil non-gold items. As a consequence, the trade deficit widened in Q3 relative to the preceding quarter. The estimate of the current account deficit (CAD) for 2014-15 is currently placed at 1.3 per cent of GDP, significantly lower than earlier projections. The CAD has been comfortably financed by net capital inflows, mainly in the form of buoyant portfolio flows but also supported by foreign direct investment inflows and external commercial borrowings. Accordingly, there was accretion to India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to the tune of USD 6.8 billion in Q3. Policy Stance and Rationale 12. By and large, inflation dynamics have so far been consistent with the assessment of the balance of risks by the Reserve Bank\u2019s bi-monthly monetary policy statements, although with some undershooting relative to the projected path of disinflation. While inflation declined faster than expected due to favourable base effects during June- November, the upturn in December turned out to be muted relative to projections. Augmenting these data with survey data on falling inflationary expectations as well as data on weak commodity prices and muted rural wage growth, the Reserve Bank projected that it would meet its objective of 6 per cent CPI inflation by January 2016. Having committed in public statements to initiate a change in the monetary policy stance as soon as incoming data permitted, the Reserve Bank cut the policy rate on January 15, 2015. The Reserve Bank also indicated that \u201ckey to further easing are data that confirm 13. continuing disinflationary pressures. Also critical would be sustained high quality fiscal consolidation\u2026\u201d. Given that there have been no substantial new developments on the disinflationary process or on the fiscal outlook since January 15, it is appropriate for the Reserve Bank to await them and maintain the current interest rate stance. 14. The upside risks to inflation stem from the unlikely possibility of significant fiscal slippage, uncertainty on the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon during 2015 as also the low probability but highly influential risks of reversal of international crude prices due to geo-political events. Heightened volatility in global financial markets, including through the exchange rate channel, also constitute a significant risk to the inflation assessment. Looking ahead, inflation is likely to be around the target level of 6 per cent by January 2016 (Chart 1). As regards the path of inflation in 2015-16, the Reserve Bank will keenly monitor the revision in the CPI, which will rebase the index to 2012 and representative consumption basket along with methodological improvements. incorporate a more 15. The outlook for growth has improved modestly on the back of disinflation, real income gains from decline in oil prices, easier financing conditions and some progress on stalled projects. These conditions should augur well for a reinvigoration of private consumption demand, but the overall impact on growth could be partly offset by the weaker global growth outlook and short-run fiscal drag due to likely compression in plan expenditure in order to meet consolidation targets set for the year. Accordingly, the baseline projection for growth using the old GDP base has been retained at 5.5 per cent for 2014-15. For 2015-16, projections are inherently contingent upon the outlook for the south-west monsoon and the balance of risks around the global outlook. Domestically, conditions for growth are slowly improving with easing input cost pressures, supportive monetary conditions and recent measures relating to project approvals, land acquisition, mining, and infrastructure. Accordingly, the central estimate for real GDP growth in 2015-16 is expected to rise to 6.5 per cent with risks broadly balanced at this point (Chart 2). The revised GDP statistics (base 2011-12) released on January 30 along with advance estimates for 2014-15 expected on February 9, 2015 will need to be carefully analysed and could result in revisions to the Reserve Bank\u2019s growth projections for 2015-16. 16. With liquidity conditions remaining comfortable, the recourse to export credit has been low \u2013 less than 50 per cent of the limit on monthly average basis since October 2014. In pursuance of the Dr. Urjit R. Patel Committee\u2019s recommendation to move away from sector-specific refinance, the ECR limit has been gradually lowered since June 2014. Continuing with this rationalisation, it has been decided to merge the facility with system level liquidity provision with effect from February 7, 2015. The Reserve Bank would continue to meet system wide liquidity needs as per the revised liquidity adjustment framework announced on August 22, 2014. In order to create space for banks to expand credit, the SLR is being reduced 17. from 22.0 per cent of NDTL to 21.5 per cent. Banks should use this headroom to increase their lending to productive sectors on competitive terms so as to support investment and growth. 18. Developmental and regulatory measures are put in place by the Reserve Bank periodically within the organising framework of the five-pillar approach announced in October 2013 in the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2013-14. The measures set out in this part of the statement emphasise broadening and deepening financial markets; fortifying banking structure; and dealing with stress in banking assets by putting projects back on track. Financial Markets 19. The Reserve Bank reduced the eligibility limit for foreign exchange remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) to USD 75,000 in 2013 as a macro- prudential measure. With stability in the foreign exchange market, this limit was enhanced to USD 125,000 in June 2014 without end-use restrictions, except for prohibited foreign exchange transactions such as margin trading, lotteries and the like. On a review of the external sector outlook and as a further exercise in macro-prudential management, it has been decided to enhance the limit under the LRS to USD 250,000 per person per year. Furthermore, in order to ensure ease of transactions, it has also been decided in consultation with the Government that all the facilities for release of exchange/ remittances for current account transactions available to resident individuals under Schedule III to Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account Transactions) Rules 2000, as amended from time to time, shall also be subsumed under this limit. 20. With a view to meeting the emerging needs of foreign direct investment in various sectors with different financing needs and varying risk perceptions as also to offer the investor some protection against downside risks, it has been decided in consultation with the Government of the pricing of introduce greater instruments/securities, including an assured return at an appropriate discount over the sovereign yield curve through an embedded optionality clause or in any other manner. Guidelines in this regard will be issued separately. in 21. The investment limit in Government securities by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is currently capped at USD 30 billion of which USD 5 billion is reserved for long term investors. The limit on investment in Government securities is now fully utilised. As a measure to incentivise long term investors, it has been decided in consultation with Government to enable reinvestment of coupons in Government securities even when the existing limits are fully utilised. 22. FPIs are currently permitted to invest in Government securities with a minimum residual maturity of three years. No such condition has been stipulated for their investments in corporate bonds. To harmonize requirements, it is decided in consultation with Government that all future investment by FPIs in the debt market in India will be required to be made with a minimum residual maturity of three years. Accordingly, all future investments within the limit for investment in corporate bonds, including the limits vacated when the current investment by an FPI runs off either through sale or redemption, shall be required to be made in corporate bonds with a minimum residual maturity of three years. Furthermore, FPIs will not be allowed to invest incrementally in short maturity liquid/money market mutual fund schemes. There will, however, be no lock-in period and FPIs shall be free to sell the securities (including those that are presently held with less than three years residual maturity) to domestic investors. Detailed operational guidelines will be issued by end-February 2015. 23. In the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2014-15, the Reserve Bank announced the implementation of the recommendations of the Committee on Financial Benchmarks (Chairman: Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar). The Bank has issued guidelines on the governance framework for benchmark submitters on April 16, 2014. The Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) and Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (FEDAI) have since issued the Code of Conduct for benchmark submitters. An independent company named \u2018\u2018Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd\u201d, jointly floated by FIMMDA, FEDAI and Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA) for administration of the rupee interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks, has been incorporated. As a further step towards strengthening the benchmark-setting methodology, it has been decided to work out the necessary infrastructural and transitional arrangements for shifting the overnight Mumbai Inter-Bank Offer Rate (MIBOR) from the existing polling based system to transaction based system of the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) by April 2015. 24. In order to develop the money and Government securities markets, cash settled 10-year interest rate futures (IRF) contracts were permitted to be introduced by stock exchanges in December 2013. A cash settled IRF contract on 10-Year Government of India (GoI) Security was launched in January 2014 and has received an encouraging response. In order to provide market participants with greater flexibility to hedge their interest rate risk, it has been decided to permit stock exchanges to introduce cash settled IRF contracts on 5-7-Year and 13-15 year Government of India Securities. Detailed operational guidelines will be issued by end-March 2015. 25. In June 2014, FPIs were permitted to participate in the exchange traded currency derivatives (ETCD) market. Simultaneously, the regulatory regime for participation of domestic entities in the ETCD market was modified with the objective of bringing about parity between the ETCD and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. With a view to providing greater flexibility to both FPIs and domestic participants in the ETCD market, it has been decided that: domestic entities and FPIs will henceforth be allowed to take foreign currency positions in the USD-INR pair up to USD 15 million per exchange without having to establish the existence of any underlying exposure. In addition, they shall be allowed to take foreign currency positions in EUR-INR, GBP-INR and JPY-INR pairs, all put together up to USD 5 million equivalent per exchange, without having to establish the existence of any underlying exposure. Domestic entities and FPIs who want to take a position exceeding the above limits in the ETCD market will have to establish the existence of an underlying exposure.  for domestic participants who are importers of goods and services, the limit up to which they can take appropriate hedging positions in ETCD markets will be determined as 100 per cent of the higher of the (i) average of their last three years\u2019 imports turnover or (ii) the previous year\u2019s turnover, instead of 50 per cent at present. documentation and other administrative requirements for hedging on the ETCD markets are also being rationalised. Detailed operational guidelines will be issued by end-March 2015. 26. At present, implementation of large projects is complex and unforeseen events may cause delays in project implementation, leading to failure in achieving the originally envisaged date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO). The Reserve Bank has allowed vide circulars dated March 31, 2010 and May 30, 2013, certain flexibility with regard to loans to projects under implementation, wherein DCCO of the projects under implementation along with repayment schedules for such loans are allowed to be shifted to a certain extent without adversely affecting the asset classification of such loans. However, in the case of projects which have been stalled primarily due to inadequacies of the current promoters/management, a change in ownership and management may be required to revive the project. In this context, the new promoters/developers may require additional time to revive/complete the stalled projects. In order to facilitate change in ownership and revival, it has been decided to provide further flexibility by allowing a further extension of the DCCO of such projects where a change of ownership takes place, without adversely affecting the asset classification of loans to such projects, subject to certain conditions. Operating guidelines in this regard will be issued shortly. According to Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, banks are 27. allowed to hold shares in a company, whether as pledgee, mortgagee or absolute owner, up to an amount not exceeding thirty per cent of the paid-up share capital of that company or thirty per cent of their own paid-up share capital and reserves, whichever is less. Banks can also acquire shares of a borrowing company by way of conversion of debt into equity, following prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances by banks and financial institutions, subject to conditions mentioned therein. However, the acquisition of shares of listed companies by conversion of debt or by any other means is required to conform to the Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements (ICDR) Regulations and the Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers (SAST) Regulations. Very often, the share prices of companies whose debt is being restructured, in accordance with the stipulations of ICDR Regulations are found to be not in consonance with their intrinsic value. This results in upfront allocation of disproportionate share of loss on restructuring to banks. In view of the above, the Reserve Bank is consulting with the SEBI for waiver, under certain specific circumstances, of the requirement of compliance with the ICDR and SAST Regulations, for conversion of debt into equity. Detailed guidelines will be issued within three months. 28. Under the Framework for Revitalising Distressed Assets in the economy, banks were allowed in February 2014 to reverse the excess provision on sale of non-performing assets (NPAs) to securitisation companies/reconstruction companies when the cash received (by way of initial sale consideration and/or redemption of security receipts/pass- through certificates) is higher than the net book value (NBV) of the asset, with a view to incentivising banks to recover appropriate value in respect of their NPAs, subject to certain conditions. This dispensation was, however, available on a prospective basis, i.e., only with regard to NPAs sold on or after February 26, 2014. On a review and based on banks\u2019 representations in this regard, it has now been decided to extend the above dispensation to NPAs sold prior to February 26, 2014 also. Detailed guidelines to this effect will be issued shortly. III. Banking and Financial Structure 29. Currently, banks are allowed to offer differential rates of interest on deposits on the basis of tenor for deposits less than ` one crore and on the basis of quantum for deposits of ` one crore and above. Banks are, however, not permitted to differentiate on the basis of any other parameter of the deposit contract. Furthermore, all deposits accepted from individuals and Hindu undivided family (HUF) up to ` one crore are callable i.e., have the facility of premature withdrawal. This results in asset-liability management issues, especially under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement under the Basel III framework. It is, therefore, proposed to allow non-callable deposits. Callability in a deposit will then be a distinguishing feature for offering differential rates on interest on deposits. Detailed guidelines will follow shortly. The final guidelines on payments banks and small finance banks as differentiated 30. banks were placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website on November 27, 2014 and clarifications on the queries were released on January 1, 2015. The last date of receipt of applications was February 2, 2015. 72 applications for Small Finance Banks and 41 applications for Payments Banks were received up to the deadline for submission yesterday. This number excludes applications that might have been received at other venues. As stated in the guidelines, two External Advisory Committees (EACs) will evaluate the applications received for setting up of small finance and payments banks and thereafter make their recommendations to the Reserve Bank. The EACs for small finance banks and payments banks will be chaired by Smt. Usha Thorat, former Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India and Dr. Nachiket Mor, Director, Central Board of the Reserve Bank, respectively. 31. scheduled on Tuesday, April 7, 2015. The first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for fiscal year 2015-16 is ", "file4": "It may be recalled that in its statement on monetary policy of January 15, 2015 the Reserve Bank reduced the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and indicated that \u201c\u201cKey to further easing are data that confirm continuing disinflationary pressures. Also critical would be sustained high quality fiscal consolidation\u2026\u201d. While maintaining the interest rate stance in its sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of February 3 in the absence of new developments on inflation or on the fiscal outlook till then, the Reserve Bank indicated that it will keenly monitor the revision in the consumer price index (CPI) with regard to the path of inflation in 2015-16 as well as the Union Budget for 2015-16. The new CPI rebased to 2012 was released on February 12, 2015. Inflation in January 2015 at 5.1 per cent as measured by the new index was well within the target of 8 per cent for January 2015. Prices of vegetables declined and, hearteningly, inflation excluding food and fuel moderated in a broad-based manner to a new low. Thus, disinflation is evolving along the path set out by the Reserve Bank in January 2014 and, in fact, at a faster pace than earlier envisaged. The uncertainties surrounding any inflation projection are, however, not insignificant. Oil prices have firmed up in recent weeks, and significant further strengthening, perhaps as a result of unanticipated geo-political events, will alter the inflation outlook. Other international commodity prices are expected to remain benign, given still-sluggish global demand conditions. Food prices will be affected by the seasonal upturn that typically occurs ahead of the south-west monsoon and, therefore, steps the government takes on food management will be critical in determining the inflation outlook. Finally, the possible spill over of volatility from international financial markets through exchange rate and asset prices channels is also still a significant risk. Perhaps the most significant influences on near-term inflation will be the strength of aggregate demand relative to available capacity. Two recent developments pertaining to the demand-supply balance are the recently-released GDP estimates and the Union Budget for 2015-16. The Central Statistical Organisation is to be commended on the changes it has made to the methodology of estimating GDP, bringing India up to international best practice. Yet the picture it presents of a robust economy, with growth having picked up significantly over the last three years, is at odds with still-low direct measures of growth of production, credit, imports and capacity utilisation as well as with anecdotal evidence on the state of the economic cycle. Nevertheless, the picture of a steadily recovering economy appears right. The fiscal impulses in the Union Budget then assume importance. There are many important and valuable structural reforms embedded in this Budget, which will help improve supply over the medium term. In the short run, however, the postponement of fiscal consolidation to the 3 per cent target by one year will add to aggregate demand. At a time of accelerating economic recovery, this is, prima facie, a source for concern from the standpoint of aggregate demand management, especially with large borrowings intended for public sector enterprises. Some factors mitigate the concern. The government has emphasized its desire to clean up legacy issues which gave a misleading picture of the true extent of fiscal rectitude, and has also moderated the optimism in its projections. To this extent, the true quantum of fiscal consolidation may be higher than in the headline numbers. Also, the government is transferring a significantly larger amount to the states, without entirely devolving responsibility for funding central programmes. To the extent that state budget deficits narrow, the general fiscal deficit will be lower. Furthermore, supported by lower international energy prices, there is a welcome intent to shift from spending on subsidies to spending on infrastructure, and to better target and further reduce subsidies through direct transfers. Finally, the central government has signed a memorandum with the Reserve Bank setting out clear inflation objectives for the latter. This makes explicit what was implicit before \u2013 that the government and the Reserve Bank have common objectives and that fiscal and monetary policy will work in a complementary way. In sum, then, the government intends to compensate for the delay in fiscal consolidation with a commitment to an improvement in the quality of adjustment. Of course, all these mitigating factors have a fair component of intent. The realised net fiscal impulse will depend on both central and state government actions going forward. Finally, the rupee has remained strong relative to peer countries. While an excessively strong rupee is undesirable, it too creates disinflationary impulses. It bears repeating here that the Reserve Bank does not target a level for the exchange rate, nor does it have an overall target for foreign exchange reserves. It does intervene on occasion, in both directions, to reduce avoidable volatility in the exchange rate. Any reserve build-up is a residual consequence of such actions rather than a direct objective. To summarise, softer readings on inflation are expected to come in through the first half of 2015-16 before firming up to below 6 per cent in the second half. The fiscal consolidation programme, while delayed, may compensate in quality, especially if state governments are cooperative. Given low capacity utilisation and still-weak indicators of production and credit off-take, it is appropriate for the Reserve Bank to be pre-emptive in its policy action to utilise available space for monetary accommodation. Consequently, it has been decided to:  reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 7.75 per cent to 7.5 per cent with immediate effect; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank-wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.5 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 8.5 per cent with immediate effect. The need to act outside the policy review cycle is prompted by two factors: First, while the next bi-monthly policy statement will be issued on April 7, 2015 the still weak state of certain sectors of the economy as well as the global trend towards easing suggests that any policy action should be anticipatory once sufficient data support the policy stance. Second, with the release of the agreement on the monetary policy framework, it is appropriate for the Reserve Bank to offer guidance on how it will implement the mandate. Going forward, the RBI will seek to bring the inflation rate to the mid-point of the band of 4 +/- 2 per cent provided for in the agreement, i.e., to 4 per cent by the end of a two year period starting fiscal year 2016-17. The guidance on policy action given in the fifth-bi-monthly monetary policy statement of December 2014 is largely unchanged. Further monetary actions will be conditioned by incoming data, especially on the easing of supply constraints, improved availability of key inputs such as power, land, minerals and infrastructure, continuing progress on high-quality fiscal consolidation, the pass through of past rate cuts into lending rates, the monsoon outturn and developments in the international environment.

Retail inflation is projected to remain below 6 per cent in 2015-16, within the target set for January 2016. Persisting slack in the economy and restrained input costs should sustain disinflationary impulses, unless disrupted by reversal in global commodity prices and/or deficiency in the south-west monsoon. Since the \ufb01 rst Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of September 2014, tectonic shifts in the global and domestic environment drastically changed the initial conditions that had underpinned staff\u2019s outlook at that time. The most signi\ufb01 cant shock to forecasts has been the collapse of international commodity prices, particularly those of crude1. For the Indian economy, this translated into a sizable softening of prices of both raw materials and intermediates. Their pass-through, given the persisting slack in economic activity, weakened pricing power and fed into a faster than anticipated easing of output price pressures. Another factor vitiating staff\u2019s baseline assumptions has been the different speeds at which global activity evolved across geographies. With several emerging market economies (EMEs) slowing down alongside sluggish advanced economies \u2013 barring the United States (US) \u2013 external demand fell away and sent prices of tradables into contraction. For India, import prices declined faster than export prices, conferring unexpected gains in net terms of trade as well as an appreciable easing of imported in\ufb02 ationary pressures. As data from the US allayed fears of early monetary policy normalisation and ultra accommodative monetary policies took hold in Europe, Japan and China as also elsewhere, risk appetite roared into \ufb01 nancial markets and India became a preferred destination for capital \ufb02 ows. The appreciating bias imparted to the exchange rate of the rupee brought with it a disin\ufb02 ation momentum. Domestically, prices of fruits and vegetables ebbed from September after supply disruptions induced spikes in July-August. Aided by proactive supply management strategies and moderation in the pace of increase in minimum support prices, food in\ufb02 ation eased more than expected2. Another favourable but unanticipated development that restrained cost-push pressures has been the sharp deceleration in rural wage growth to below 6 per cent by January 2015 from 16 per cent during April-October 20133. The con\ufb02 uence of these factors forti\ufb01 ed the anti-in\ufb02 ationary stance of monetary policy and reinforced the impact of the policy rate increases effected between September 2013 to January 2014. In the event, CPI in\ufb02 ation4 retreated below the January 2015 target of 8 per cent by close to 300 basis points. Going forward, staff\u2019s assessment of initial conditions and consequent revisions to forecasts in this MPR will be fundamentally shaped by these developments. The outlook will also likely be in\ufb02 uenced by the new monetary policy framework put in place in February 2015, marking a watershed in India\u2019s monetary history. The Government of India and the Reserve Bank have committed to an institutional architecture that accords primacy to price stability as an objective of monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Framework Agreement envisages the conduct of monetary policy around a nominal anchor numerically de\ufb01 ned as below 6 per cent CPI in\ufb02 ation for 2015-16 (to be achieved by January 2016) and 4 +/- 2 per cent for all subsequent years, with the mid-point of this band, i.e., 4 per cent to be achieved by the end of 2017-18. Failure to achieve these targets for three consecutive quarters will trigger accountability mechanisms, including public statements by the Governor on reasons for deviation of in\ufb02 ation from its target, remedial actions and the time that will be taken to return in\ufb02 ation to the mid-point of the in\ufb02 ation target band. This \ufb02 exible in\ufb02 ation targeting (FIT) framework greatly enhances the credibility and effectiveness of 1 As against the baseline of US$ 100 per barrel assumed for the Indian basket of crude in September 2014, the average price for October \u2013 March works out to about US$ 64 per barrel. 2 In the second half of 2014-15 so far, average food in\ufb02 ation fell by 340 basis points from 8.2 per cent in April-September 2014. 3 After the revision of rural wage series by the Labour Bureau in November 2013, wage growth rates are not strictly comparable, 4 Unless stated otherwise, CPI in\ufb02 ation refers to year-on-year changes in the all India Consumer Price Index (CPI) combined (rural and urban) or CPI-C (base 2012=100). monetary policy, and particularly, the pursuit of the in\ufb02 ation targets that have been set. The commitment of the Government to this framework enhances credibility signi\ufb01 cantly since it indicates that the Government will do its part on the \ufb01 scal side and on supply constraints to reduce the burden on monetary policy in achieving price stability. In\ufb02 ation expectations of various economic agents polled in forward looking surveys have been easing, partly re\ufb02 ecting the adaptation of expectations to the decline in in\ufb02 ation as well as growing credibility around the Reserve Bank\u2019s in\ufb02 ation targets. Although households\u2019 expectations of in\ufb02 ation three months ahead as well as one year ahead appear to have \ufb01 rmed up modestly in March 2015 in response to the uptick in retail in\ufb02 ation in January \u2013 February 2015, the softening of food and fuel in\ufb02 ation will likely temper those expectations going forward (Chart I.1 and Box I.1). This is borne out by the survey of professional forecasters for March 2015 in which \ufb01 ve years ahead in\ufb02 ation expectations have dropped by 50 basis Understanding the dynamic interaction between in\ufb02 ation and in\ufb02 ation expectations is important for setting monetary policy. In\ufb02 ation is sensitive to change in the output gap and in\ufb02 ation expectations, both of which monetary policy can in\ufb02 uence by modulating aggregate demand. In countries where inflation expectations are well anchored, in\ufb02 ation has become less sensitive to variations in the output gap, leading to a \ufb02 attening of the Phillips curve. In these countries, in\ufb02 ation has even become less sensitive to major supply shocks (Bernanke, 2007). Survey-based gauges of expectations tend to be somewhat backward-looking for the near term \u2013 responding to changes in actual inflation, Price movements of frequently bought food products have a signi\ufb01 cant bearing on in\ufb02 ation expectations. Fuel prices also move in\ufb02 ation expectations quickly: despite having lower weights in the consumption basket, their price changes get wide publicity in the media and in\ufb02 uence expectations faster than their actual impact on the consumption basket. Longer-term expectations are typically more stable. Empirical analysis using data for the period September 2008 to December 2014 shows that 3 months ahead in\ufb02 ation expectations move largely in response to changes in prices of vegetables/fruits and petrol \u2013 which together explain almost 60 per cent of the change in in\ufb02 ation expectations. These \ufb01 ndings are robust, i.e., even if the last quarter (October-December 2014) \u2013 when in\ufb02 ation expectations declined sharply \u2013 is excluded from the sample, the estimated coef\ufb01 cients remain stable. The experience of in\ufb02 ation targeting countries suggests that a credible monetary policy framework with clarity about the objective function of the central bank helps in anchoring in\ufb02 ation expectations. In the UK for example, just the announcement of instrument independence for the Bank of England in May 1997 led to an immediate fall in in\ufb02 ation expectations by 50 basis points along the entire term structure (Haldane, 2000). In this context, the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement in India should be able to reinforce the disin\ufb02 ationary forces currently at work and anchor in\ufb02 ation expectations around the medium-term in\ufb02 ation target. Bernanke, Ben S. (2007), \u201cIn\ufb02 ation Expectations and Inflation Forecasting\u201d, July 10, 2007. <http://www. federalreser ve.gov/newsevents/speech/ bernanke20070710a.htm> points to 5.3 per cent. Professional forecasters expect CPI in\ufb02 ation to average between 5.0 and 6.0 per cent in 2015-16 (Chart I.2). The industrial outlook survey of the Reserve Bank indicates that manufacturers expect softer input prices in the near-term, which could transmit to output prices with a lag in view of the slack in economic activity (Chart I.3). Turning to in\ufb02 ation forecasts, large and unanticipated changes in initial conditions referred earlier warrant revised baseline assumptions (Table I.1). Updated estimates of structural models and information yielded by surveys and market-based gauges indicate that CPI in\ufb02 ation will remain below the target of 6 per cent set for January 2016, hovering around 5 per cent in the \ufb01 rst half of 2015-16, and a little above 5.5 per cent in \uf020 Indian crude oil basket price at US$ 100 per barrel for the remaining part of the year. \uf020 Exchange rate at about Rs. 60 per US$ for the remaining part of the year. \uf020 Indian crude oil basket* price at US$ 60 per barrel in the \ufb01 rst half and US$ 63 per barrel in the second half of FY 2015-16. \uf020 Current level of the exchange rate.** \uf020 No increase in diesel prices from September 2014 onwards. \uf020 No change in LPG and kerosene prices. \uf020 No increase in administered liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene prices in the remaining part of the year. \uf020 Global growth picking up in the second half of the year, as projected in the World Economic Outlook (WEO) July 2014 update, IMF. \uf020 Normal monsoons during 2015-16. \uf020 Global economy expected to grow at 3.5 per cent in 2015 (weaker by 0.3 percentage point from earlier projections) as per the WEO January 2015 update, IMF. \uf020 Achievement of fiscal deficit targets as outlined in the Union Budget for 2014-15. \uf020 Achievement of fiscal deficit targets as indicated in the Union Budget for 2015-16. \uf020 No major change in domestic macroeconomic/structural policies during the forecast horizon. \uf020 No major change in domestic macroeconomic/structural policies during the forecast horizon.

Uncertainties surrounding commodity prices, monsoon and weather-related disturbances, volatility in prices of seasonal items and spillovers from external developments through exchange rate and asset price channels are re\ufb02 ected in a 70 per cent con\ufb01 dence interval of 3.7 per cent to 7.9 per cent around the baseline in\ufb02 ation projection of 5.8 per cent for Q4 of 2015-16. Medium-term projections derived from model estimates assuming an unchanged economic structure, \ufb01 scal consolidation in line with the recalibrated path, a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks indicate that CPI in\ufb02 ation in 2016-17 could be around 5.0 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17, with risks evenly balanced around it. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for 2014- 15 was projected by the Reserve Bank at 5.5 per cent. The CSO\u2019s provisional estimates of GDP (base: 2004-05) tracked staff\u2019s projected path well up to Q2 of 2014-15. The new GDP data (rebased to 2011-12) released by the Central Statistics Of\ufb01 ce (CSO) at the end of January 2015 and on February 9, however, came as a major surprise as it produced signi\ufb01 cantly higher growth at constant prices. The divergence between the new series and the old series in the pace of growth of the manufacturing sector has turned out to be stark; in particular, the robust expansion of manufacturing portrayed in the new series is not validated by subdued corporate sector performance in Q3 and still weak industrial production5. In the \ufb01 nancial and real estate sub-sector, the high growth of 13.7 per cent at constant prices is not corroborated by the observed sluggishness in key underlying variables such as credit and deposit growth, housing prices, rent and most importantly, the subdued performance 5 For higher growth rates resulting from steep upward revision in estimates for the private corporate sector, please see R Nagaraj (2015), \u201cSeeds of Doubt on New GDP Numbers - Private Corporate Sector Overestimated?\u201d, Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. L No.13, March 28. of real estate companies in terms of sales growth and earnings. Data revisions and their after-effects are not unique to India, but the magnitude of the gap in real GDP growth rates between the old and the new series for 2013-14 and 2014-15 has complicated the setting of monetary policy. Undoubtedly, the new GDP data embody better coverage and improved methodology as per international best practices. Yet these data cloud an accurate assessment of the state of the business cycle and the appropriate monetary policy stance; particularly, they render forecasting tenuous. Projections based on the new series are also handicapped by the lack of suf\ufb01 cient history in terms of backdated data amenable to modelling. The macroeconomic environment is expected to improve in 2015-16, with \ufb01 scal policy gearing to an investment-led growth strategy6 and monetary policy using available room for accommodation. Business conditions in Indian manufacturing assessed in the Reserve Bank\u2019s Business Expectations Index (BEI) developed from its industrial outlook survey indicates that Q1 of 2015-16 may see some tempering of the improvement in the second half of 2014-15 (Chart I.5). This is corroborated by some of the surveys polled by other agencies (Table I.2). It is important to 6 Besides signi\ufb01 cantly higher allocation for infrastructure, other initiatives such as the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, the proposal to set up power projects with all prior approvals before awarding them through transparent auctions to the private sector, efforts to improve doing business in India and easing the availability of coal through auctions should help in brightening the overall investment climate while also crowding in private investment. 6.0 17.7 recognise though that most of these surveys were conducted before the presentation of the Union Budget and the easing of monetary policy on March 4. The Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer con\ufb01 dence survey (CCS) points to growing consumer optimism since June 2014, re\ufb02 ecting purchasing power gains arising from lower in\ufb02 ation as well as improved perception of income, spending and employment growth (Chart I.6). Large declines in commodity prices and the benign in\ufb02 ation outlook for the near-term should provide a boost to growth (Box I.2). Nevertheless, there are downside risks to growth which could restrain growth prospects if they materialise. The ongoing downturn in the international commodity price cycle, which commenced in 2012, For a large net importer of crude oil like India, the decline in crude prices since June 2014 by about 50 per cent is a favourable external shock. Going forward, this could work towards improving growth prospects and easing in\ufb02 ation pressures further. Crude prices could impact economic activity and in\ufb02 ation in India through several channels: (i) higher real incomes for consumers; (ii) lower input costs, boosting corporate pro\ufb01 tability and inducing investment; (iii) lower current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD); and (iv) improved market sentiment. These favourable effects could, however, be offset by weak global demand. In India, a US$ 50 per barrel decline in oil prices (Indian basket) sustained over one year could give rise to higher real income equivalent of about 4 per cent of total private consumption demand and about 2.9 per cent of nominal GDP. Assuming 50 per cent pass-through to domestic prices of petroleum products, the real income gain could enhance aggregate consumption demand by about 2 per cent and output by more than 1 per cent. For the corporate sector in India, particularly non-oil producing firms (such as cement, electricity, iron and steel, chemicals, textiles and transportation), with more than 5 per cent of their total costs in the form of fuel, panel regressions show a statistically significant inverse relationship between pro\ufb01 tability and oil prices. Model estimates suggest that for a 10 per cent decline in oil prices (under alternative assumptions of pass-through to CPI) output growth could improve in the range of 0.1-0.3 percentage points, while CPI in\ufb02 ation could decline by about 20-25 basis points below the baseline. A caveat is in order though. The estimates presented under the balance of risks in this Chapter may differ due to different dynamics captured in different models and varying assumptions on pass-through. For instance in India, the entire decline in crude prices was not fully passed on because of the increase in excise duty on petroleum products by the Government. This suggests that model-based estimates at best could be indicative rather than precise. World Bank (2015). \u201cGlobal Economic Prospects\u201d, January 2015. could reverse, given occasional signs of oil prices reviving ahead of global economic activity. In fact, the volatile geopolitical environment could even hasten the reversal. The consequent resurgence of in\ufb02 ation pressures could overwhelm the nascent conditions setting in for recovery. Risks to budgetary forecasts from tax shortfalls, subsidy overshoots and disinvestment under-realisation could impact the level of budgeted allocation for capital expenditure. Early warnings on the south-west monsoon, given the probability of about 50 per cent currently being assigned to an El Nino event, could dent the outlook for agriculture. Finally, if the decline in the gross saving as percentage of Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) from 33 per cent in 2011-12 to 30 per cent in 2013-14 continues into the medium-term, it could tighten the \ufb01 nancial constraint to growth unless productivity improves signi\ufb01 cantly. Growth projections combining these forward looking assessments and model-based forecasts, including time series forecasts such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Bayesian vector auto regressions (BVAR), point to a gradual pick-up in growth. Quarterly projections relate to gross value added (GVA) at basic prices, because of more robust estimation relative to expenditure side GDP and also due to better clarity on key indicators that are used in the compilation of data by the CSO. Growth in GVA at basic prices for 2015-16 is projected at 7.8 per cent, with risks evenly balanced around this baseline forecast. Possible revision to CSO\u2019s estimates for 2014-15 is a key risk to the forecast, with the revisions expected to be in the downward direction (please see Chapter III) and consequently an upside bias gets built in (Chart I.7)7. For 2016-17, real growth in GVA at basic prices is projected at 8.1 per cent, assuming gradual cyclical recovery on the back of a supportive policy environment, but without any policy induced structural change or any major supply shock. If the GDP growth for 2014-15 is revised down by the CSO, the trajectory will change accordingly. The Reserve Bank\u2019s professional forecasters\u2019 survey indicates an 7 Model-based projection for 2015-16 using old GDP (at factor cost) data yields output growth at 6.5 per cent, as against 7.8 per cent projected for GVA at basic prices. The baseline paths projected for growth and in\ufb02 ation are subject to realisation of a set of underlying assumptions (Table I.1). The likely paths relative to the baseline that may evolve under plausible risk scenarios are set out below (Charts I.9 and I.10). Global crude oil prices are assumed to increase gradually over the forecast horizon in the baseline projections. There is, however, a non-trivial risk of a sharp increase in international crude prices triggered by the materialisation of geo-political tensions and other supply disruptions. In the event of such a shock pushing crude oil prices up by about US$ 15-20 per barrel above the baseline, in\ufb02 ation could be higher by about 40-60 basis points (bps) by the end of 2015- In\ufb02 ation (Y-o-Y) in Q4 Output Growth (per cent) \u2013 GVA at basic prices Fiscal De\ufb01 cit (per cent of GDP) Current Account Balance (per cent of GDP) Private Final Consumption Expenditure growth rate at current prices (per cent) Gross Saving (per cent to Gross National Disposable Income) Gross Fixed Capital Formation (per cent of GDP) Money Supply (M3) (growth rate in per cent) (end period) Bank Credit of all scheduled commercial banks (growth rate in per cent) Combined Gross Fiscal De\ufb01 cit (per cent to GDP) Central Govt.

Growth could weaken by 10-30 bps over the next two years as the direct impact of higher input costs would be reinforced by spillover effects from lower world demand. As against the normal monsoon assumption in the baseline, there is a risk of monsoon turning out to be de\ufb01 cient in 2015. This could lead to a lower agriculture output which, in turn, would lower the overall GVA growth by around 40 bps in 2015-16. Food prices could consequently increase, leading to in\ufb02 ation rising above the baseline by 80-100 bps in 2015-16. Factors like spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon, policies relating to food stocks, procurement and minimum support prices (MSPs) may moderate or accentuate the impact of rainfall de\ufb01 ciency. Uncertainties surrounding the exchange rate persist. The key risk is that normalisation of monetary policy by the US Fed which may spark off safe haven capital \ufb02 ows into US treasuries and spur further appreciation of the US dollar. On the other hand, de\ufb02 ation risks in some of the advanced economies could warrant further monetary accommodation. A depreciation of the rupee by around 10 per cent, relative to the baseline assumption of the current level of exchange rates continuing, could raise in\ufb02 ation by around 20 -30 bps in 2015-16. On average, growth would be higher by about 10 bps in 2015-16 due to an improvement in the external trade balance while it could turn out to be marginally weaker in 2016-17, assuming tightness in \ufb01 nancial conditions intensifying further on materialisation of risks in the external environment. Headline in\ufb02 ation could also undershoot from the baseline if food in\ufb02 ation moderates by more than what is envisaged. This could be brought about by positive supply shocks, especially through improvements in the supply chain, reforms in market infrastructure and a step-up in investment in agriculture. In such a scenario, headline in\ufb02 ation may be lower by around 100 bps than the baseline by the end of 2015-16. If crude oil prices decline below the baseline by US$ 15-20 per barrel in the near-term as a result of excess supply conditions/low global demand in a stable geo-political environment, in\ufb02 ation could turn out to be 30-60 bps below the baseline by the end of 2015-16. Such a decline in crude prices would also raise GVA growth by 10-30 bps above the baseline in the next two years under different pass-through scenarios. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the advance estimates of GDP growth for 2014-15 and information on real economic activity relating to Q4 is expected to be better captured in the revised estimates, which would be released around the end of May 2015. If GVA growth (at constant prices) gets revised downwards by 50 bps in the subsequent release(s), it would alter the assessment of demand conditions and a decline in the in\ufb02 ation trajectory for the medium-term by 10-30 bps could result. If the boost to investment expenditure announced in the Union Budget for 2015-16 helps in crowding in if and private investment demand picks up, GDP growth may turn out to be over 50 bps above the baseline in 2015-16. With augmentation of capacity but a still negative output gap, the impact of higher investment demand on in\ufb02 ation in 2015-16 could be minimal. The balance of risks and possible deviations of in\ufb02 ation and growth paths from their projected baselines warrant a careful appraisal of forward guidance, especially the underlying conditions that drive such guidance (Box I.3). The outlook for growth and in\ufb02 ation is informed by the assessment of macroeconomic and \ufb01 nancial conditions presented in Chapters II to V. Barring unforeseen shocks, the near-term appears to be characterised by continuing slack in the economy. intentions and weak rural Fiscal consolidation consumption demand are likely to keep demand side risks to in\ufb02 ation contained. From the supply side, risks in the form of reversal in global commodity prices, uncertainty surrounding monsoon outcomes, and possible exchange market pressures arising from the Forward guidance acquired prominence communication of monetary policy of central banks of both advanced and emerging economies after the global crisis, particularly on confronting the zero lower bound (ZLB) constraint. Traditionally, forward guidance before the global crisis used to be in the form of \u201cforecast but do not promise\u201d; but at ZLB it became a policy instrument \u2013 investment demand could be conditioned by expectations about the future path of short-term interest rates. Thus, forward guidance at ZLB potentially ampli\ufb01 ed the easing impact of unconventional monetary policy. The use of forward guidance as an instrument of policy in normal times shifts the burden of understanding risks and uncertainty primarily to central banks who, in turn, face the trade-off between \u201ccredibility\u201d and \u201c\ufb02 exibility\u201d. Four broad variants of forward guidance have been used by central banks in the post-crisis period: (a) qualitative guidance on the likely stance of policy without linking it to any explicit end date, threshold value of any goal variable or key parameters; (b) qualitative guidance linked to evolution of speci\ufb01 c state variables; (c) calendar-based forward guidance specifying the exact period over which the same policy stance will prevail; and (d) outcome-based forward guidance linked to threshold values of state variables. While the \ufb01 rst two variants are somewhat open-ended, the third is time-contingent and the last one is state-contingent. Time and state-contingent forward guidance provides greater certainty, but strong commitment may limit \ufb02 exibility. Balance of risks assessments often assume speci\ufb01 c identi\ufb01 able risks and the manner in which these could be transmitted. Unanticipated risks and model errors, however, could make the evolution of in\ufb02 ation and growth paths quite different from either the baseline or the risk scenarios. Financial market frictions could complicate risk assessment further, especially if they are either not explicitly modelled or their dynamic interactions with the real economy are not captured properly in models. When bene\ufb01 ts of commitment under forward guidance are assessed against bene\ufb01 ts of changing the policy stance not fully consistent with the guidance, occasionally the latter may be preferred because of developments that were hard to anticipate at the time of giving the forward guidance. This has led to the view that forward guidance should be a tool that must be reserved for use only under the ZLB constraint: \u201c...For the policy practitioner, uncertainty is not abstract, it is a daily preoccupation. Uncertainty and the policy errors it can foster must not only be embedded in our decision-making processes ex ante, they must be worn like an ill-\ufb01 tting suit ex post, that is, with humility\u201d (Poloz, 2014). In India, forward guidance has served the purpose of guiding market expectations around monitoring the sources of and risks to in\ufb02 ation. Given the uncertainties surrounding time varying output gap estimates, the evolution of exogenous factors driving the in\ufb02 ation process, global spillovers, and the nature, size and timing of measures undertaken by the Government to contain in\ufb02 ation, forward guidance has to be conditioned by incoming data. Poloz, Stephen S. (2014). \u201cIntegrating Uncertainty and Monetary Policy-Making: A Practitioner\u2019s Perspective\u201d, Bank of Canada Discussion Paper 2014-6. volatility in capital \ufb02 ows associated with US monetary policy normalisation would need to be monitored carefully and continuously, given the past experience with spillovers from taper talk. The room for accommodating supply shocks in the conduct of monetary policy remains limited, even as supporting the revival of investment demand assumes high importance. The trajectory of headline inflation in the second half of 2014-15 turned out to be substantially lower than staff\u2019s assessment set out in the MPR of September 2014, aided by a sharp fall in global commodity prices and domestic food inflation. Cost pressures eased with falling raw material prices and slowdown in wage growth. Three major developments that followed the first Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of September 2014 have dramatically altered the evolution of underlying price/ cost conditions. First, the pass-through of the 28 per cent plunge in international commodity prices1 into domestic food, fuel and services prices worked in conjunction with the disin\ufb02 ationary stance of monetary policy to bring down in\ufb02 ation to 5.4 per cent in February 2015. Second, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) unveiled data revisions relating to consumer price index (CPI) and national accounts in January-February 2015 that updated the base years/weighting schemes and also brought in methodological improvements to align with international best practices (Boxes II.1 and III.1). Going forward, these information upgrades will have a bearing on staff\u2019s assessment of inflation formation and forecasts. Third, the Government of India and the Reserve Bank formalised a landmark agreement on the monetary policy framework alluded to in Chapter I. These institutional changes will condition the future path of in\ufb02 ation to which the Reserve Bank and the Government of India are committing, if \ufb01 scal targets are adhered to and administrative interventions in the formation of key prices, wages and interest rates are minimised. Beginning January 2015, the CSO revised the base year of the CPI to 2012 (from 2010=100). The weighting pattern of the revised series is based on the 2011- 12 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) of the National Sample Survey Of\ufb01 ce (NSSO), which is more representative and recent than the CES 2004-05 used for the old series (Table II.B.1). A number of methodological also been undertaken by the CSO in the new series, which include: improvements have included in addition to those items covered by above poverty line (APL) and below poverty line (BPL) categories; and iv. the sample size for collection of house rent data has been doubled from 6,684 in the old series to 13,368 in the revised series. i. weighting diagrams use the modi\ufb01 ed mixed reference period* (MMRP) data of CES 2011-12 as against a uniform reference period (URP) of 30 days used in the earlier series; ii. geometric mean of the price relatives with respect to base prices is used to compile elementary/item indices, instead of the arithmetic mean used in the old series, thereby reducing the impact of large discrete change in prices over different markets; iii. in case of items sold through the public distribution system (PDS), prices of items covered under the antyodaya anna yojana (AAY) have also been Food and beverages Pan, tobacco and intoxicants Clothing and footwear Housing Fuel and light Miscellaneous Total Excluding Food and Fuel Under MMRP, data on expenditure incurred are collected for frequently purchased items \u2013 edible oil, eggs, \ufb01 sh, meat, vegetables, fruits, spices, beverages, processed foods, pan, tobacco and intoxicants \u2013 during the last seven days; for clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods, during the last 365 days; and for all other food, fuel and light, miscellaneous goods and services including non-institutional medical services; rents and taxes during the last 30 days. 1 As measured by the IMF\u2019s primary commodity price index. The MPR of September 2014 had noted that the receding of inflationary pressures, guided by the monetary policy stance set out in January 2014, halted in the \ufb01 rst half of 2014-15. While fuel in\ufb02 ation and in\ufb02 ation excluding food and fuel underwent steady moderation, headline in\ufb02 ation was propped up by food in\ufb02 ation, which experienced bouts of weather-induced short-lived surges. In September, however, in\ufb02 ation eased by 140 basis points. From September to November, disinflation gathered momentum and turned out to be faster than initially anticipated under the combined in\ufb02 uence of a large decline in global commodity prices, softening of prices of fruits and vegetables domestically, continuing slack in the economy and the favourable \u2018base effect\u2019 of higher in\ufb02 ation a year ago (Chart II.1). The role of this base effect in in\ufb02 ation outcomes during 2014-15 turned out to be non-trivial. Just as it shaped the rapid disin\ufb02 ation until November, its reversal from December produced an upturn, despite still benign international commodity prices and moderate domestic food and input prices. Sequential changes in headline in\ufb02 ation re\ufb02 ect the combined impact of month-on- month (m-o-m) changes in prices \u2013 which provide an indication of the speed at which prices are evolving \u2013 and base effects. The momentum of headline in\ufb02 ation has been weak through December-February, mostly due to the prices of non-durable goods, especially perishable food (Chart II.2a). M-o-M price changes embodied in a diffusion index also point to weak momemtum; however, broad-based price pressures persist across items within the CPI (Chart II.2b). Going forward, base effects are likely to exert a downward pull on headline in\ufb02 ation up to August 2015 (Chart II.3). The intra-year path of headline in\ufb02 ation in 2014-15 exhibited higher volatility than in past years, essentially reflecting the contributions of its constituents (Chart II.4). The contribution of the food category weighted by its share in the CPI underwent large variations \u2013 accounting for more than half of headline in\ufb02 ation in the \ufb01 rst half of 2014-15, but declining to about a third in November before increasing to close to 60 per cent by February. By contrast, the contribution of the category excluding food and fuel has been relatively stable, with some decline in recent months. Within the food group, different drivers have propelled individual elements (Chart II.5a). For cereals, moderation in in\ufb02 ation is attributable to lower increases in MSPs in 2014-152, active supply management policies in the form of increased allocation under the public distribution system (PDS) as well as open market sales of wheat. Moreover, an index of prices of PDS items (rice, wheat and sugar) captured within the CPI shows that PDS prices have fallen signi\ufb01 cantly even as market prices of these items have risen (Chart II.5b). In the case of vegetables and fruits, prices declined faster than expected in response to policy actions to discourage stockpiling3. Sugar prices moderated in consonance with global prices. However, prices of protein-rich items (eggs, \ufb01 sh, meat, milk and pulses) exhibited downward rigidity, reflecting structural mismatches between demand and supply. In the absence of revisions in administered prices of coal and cooking gas, fuel group in\ufb02 ation declined 2 Minimum support prices were increased by only 0-5 per cent for various crops in 2014-15. 3 These include delisting of fruits and vegetables from the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act; bringing onions and potatoes under the Essential Commodities Act; raising minimum export prices and augmented access to imports. during the year, but rose to 4.7 per cent in February, mainly on account of increase in firewood and electricity prices (Chart II.6). The still large under- recovery on account of kerosene and cooking gas impeded the pass-through of lower international prices to administered prices of these items. During April- December 2014, under-recoveries of oil marketing companies (OMCs) in respect of sale of kerosene and cooking gas accumulated to `562 billion, amounting to potential outgoes under subsidies in spite of the drastic fall in international prices. With the pass-through of monetary policy actions into the economy, in\ufb02 ation excluding food and fuel ebbed steadily during 2014-15, reaching 4.1 per cent in February (Chart II.7). The decline in housing in\ufb02 ation (rentals) has been pronounced in the new base series relative to the old series in part due to methodological improvements set out in Box II.1. In\ufb02 ation in prices of services such as health, education and household services showed some moderation in recent months, re\ufb02 ecting the slowdown in wage growth. For the transport and communication sub-group, de\ufb02 ation has set in from January 2015 under the impact of a sharp decline in international crude oil prices which affected prices of fuels included in this sub- group. Between June 2014 and January 2015, crude oil prices (Indian basket, rupee terms) declined by around 55 per cent, with 90 per cent of this fall occurring during October to January. In response, retail prices of petrol softened. Diesel prices, on the other hand, were increased step-wise till August in order to eliminate under-recoveries of OMCs; thereafter, there was a reduction during October to January (Chart II.8). The decline in domestic pump prices, however, was much lower than the downward movement in international crude oil prices on account of increases in excise duty cumulatively by `7.75 per litre on petrol and by `6.50 on diesel starting November 2014. Global crude prices remained volatile during February-March, tracking geopolitical and other global supply side developments referred to earlier. All measures of in\ufb02 ation generally co-moved with the headline CPI in\ufb02 ation since the last MPR. The decline in in\ufb02 ation in terms of the wholesale price index (WPI), however, has been most signi\ufb01 cant with a contraction of 2.1 per cent in the month of February 2015 (Table II.1). Since the MPR of September 2014, cost-push pressures in the Indian economy have eased signi\ufb01 cantly. As shown in the foregoing section, external cost conditions associated with imports of commodities, particularly crude and petroleum products, have declined on a large scale. This is directly re\ufb02 ected in the drop in wholesale price in\ufb02 ation into negative territory. Domestically too, input cost pressures have been abating on a sustained basis since June. However, the existence of supply constraints in various sectors of the economy is impeding a fuller response of output prices to these developments. Input costs for both farm and industrial sectors have contracted since Q3 of 2014-15 (Chart II.9). Manufacturing \ufb01 rms participating in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey also indicated sizable declines in raw material costs, with the lowest cost pressures since the January-March 2010 round (Table II.2). They have also been reporting improvement in pass-through into selling prices, including in the January-March 2015 round. Purchasing managers\u2019 surveys for both manufacturing and services corroborate these assessments \u2013 the narrowing of the gap between input and output prices is indicating weakening pricing power. Wage growth, another key determinant of costs, has been decelerating, albeit from high levels, across various sectors of the economy in recent years. The slowdown in rural wage growth has been particularly noteworthy. The Labour Bureau revised data on rural wages in November 2013 to incorporate a number of new occupations besides reclassi\ufb01 cation of the existing occupations. It estimates that average annual growth in rural wages was 5.5 per cent for all occupations (agricultural and non-agricultural) for male workers in January 2015, substantially lower than the annual average growth of 15 per cent during the six-year period (2007-13) reported in the old series (Chart II.10). The slowdown in wage growth has been more pronounced 53.5 -49.9 -62.2 -55.3 -54.1 -49.5 -44.7 -41.5 -32.8 in the case of unskilled labourers, presumably re\ufb02 ecting catch-up of low-wage states, sustained decline in rural developments suggest that high real wage growth is not sustainable. Unit labour costs4 in manufacturing and services have picked up recently after moderating since 2013 4 As measured by the ratio of staff cost to value of production. (Chart II.11a). There was also a rise in the share of labour cost in total output, especially for the manufacturing sector (Chart II.11b). Assessments of price/cost conditions in the economy, juxtaposed with the results of empirical analysis, provide useful insights into the state of aggregate supply \u2013 the responsiveness of aggregate output to price changes. Several factors determine the behaviour of aggregate supply, including the time-varying price- setting behaviour of \ufb01 rms in response to changes in marginal cost; the nature of price-setting, whether backward-looking or more \ufb02 exible; the way in\ufb02 ation expectations are formed; and random supply shocks5. In technical terms, while price-setting behaviour determines the slope of the aggregate supply curve, the formation of in\ufb02 ation expectations and the incidence of supply shocks can produce shifts in the aggregate supply curve. The empirical evidence suggests that the behaviour of aggregate supply has been changing in recent years even as in\ufb02 ation dynamics have been evolving into uncharted territory. Price-setting behaviour of firms is now reckoned as less backward-looking than before; also, the response of in\ufb02 ation to demand and supply shocks has declined. Internationally, this has led to a loose consensus around the view that the aggregate supply curve has flattened and is turning out to be less 5 Angeloni, I., J. Gali, L. Aucremanne, A. Levin, M. Ehrmann and F. Smets (2006). \u201cNew Evidence on In\ufb02 ation Persistence and Price Stickiness in the Euro Area: Implications for Macro Modeling\u201d, Journal of the European Economic Association, Vol. 4(2\u20133), pp. 562\u2013574. sensitive to price shocks6. What this implies in the context of conducting monetary policy is that every unit of disin\ufb02 ation is going to cost more in terms of the sacrifice of output to rein in that amount of in\ufb02 ation. Empirical evidence available in the Indian context suggests that the behaviour of aggregate supply has undergone a change during the post-global crisis period in a manner that is broadly consistent with the international experience, but with country-speci\ufb01 c nuances. In particular, the responsiveness of retail in\ufb02 ation to changes in marginal costs has declined. Furthermore, the sacri\ufb01 ce ratio7 has increased markedly relative to the international evidence. This has implications for monetary policy: going forward, every 6 Mishkin, F. S.

Every cloud has a silver lining though; unlocking stalled investments, bridging gaps in the availability of key inputs such as power, land, infrastructure and human skill, and rebuilding productivity and competitiveness will improve the supply response and sustain the disin\ufb02 ation currently underway. This scenario envisages monetary policy in a steering rather than interventionist role in its commitment to price stability as its primary objective. Finally, as regards the impact of shocks, exchange rate pass-through8 has declined signi\ufb01 cantly. On the other hand, domestic shocks such as a de\ufb01 cient monsoon leave progressively deeper imprints on retail in\ufb02 ation and increase the persistence of in\ufb02 ation expectations. 7 The sacri\ufb01 ce ratio is de\ufb01 ned as the cumulative output losses that an economy must endure to reduce average in\ufb02 ation, on a permanent basis, by one percentage point. 8 Exchange rate pass-through is de\ufb01 ned as the degree of responsiveness of domestic prices to a unit change in the exchange rate. Domestic economic activity firmed up in 2014-15, spurred by a pick-up in manufacturing and services. Little definitive evidence, however, is available on a clear \u2018break-out\u2019 of economic activity. Key macroeconomic indicators, leading and coincident, point to the presence of considerable slack in the economy. Recent upgrades to the national accounts by the CSO indicate that a rebound in economic activity that started in 2013-14 has gathered pace in the second half of 2014-15. While these estimates have generated considerable public scrutiny and debate, there is a building optimism that an in\ufb02 exion point in the economic cycle is approaching. As in\ufb02 ation retreats in an environment of macroeconomic and political stability, con\ufb01 dence in setting a double-digit growth trajectory for the Indian economy over the medium- term is \ufb02 ooding back. Unleashing of these growth impulses hinges around decisively cutting the Gordian knot of binding supply constraints, investments locked in stalled projects and shortfalls in the availability of key inputs such as power, land, infrastructure and human skill formation. Business sentiment is also buoyed by investor-friendly tax proposals, planned switches in public spending from in private investment that crowd subsidies to enterprise, structural reforms and the intention to continue \ufb01 scal consolidation announced in the Union Budget for 2015-16. per cent in 2014-15 from 6.9 per cent a year ago (Table III.1). Although of\ufb01 cial data for Q4 of 2014-15 will be available only by May 2015, implicit in the advance estimates for the full year is a step-up in the momentum of growth in the last quarter of the year. Driving this quickening of activity, the weighted contribution of private \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure is estimated to have risen to 4.1 per cent in 2014-15 from 3.6 per cent in 2013-14. Quarterly data suggest, however, that the growth of private \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure slowed down considerably in Q3 of 2014-15; it would need to have grown by around 12 per cent in Q4 to match advance estimates of 7.1 per cent for the full year. Coincident and leading indicators of consumption, however, point to persisting fragility of private consumption demand. Indicators of rural demand like sales of tractors and two wheelers point to persisting weakness. Rural income appears to have been adversely affected by de\ufb01 cient monsoons and decelerating growth in rural wages. Overall weakness in consumption demand is also evident in the still depressed production of consumer goods and signi\ufb01 cant deceleration in corporate sales growth (Chart III.1).

Source: Central Statistics Of\ufb01 ce Government \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure (which includes consumption expenditure of the centre, states, local bodies and autonomous bodies) rose by 10 per cent in 2014-15 as per the advance estimates, mainly on account of faster expenditure growth by the states1. The aggregate expenditure growth of the Centre, however, moderated.

Non-tax revenues, however, exceeded the budgetary targets due to higher receipts on account of dividends and pro\ufb01 ts (Table III.2). Disinvestment receipts were less than half the budgeted amount in 2014-15. The Union Budget 2015-16 has provided for higher allocations infrastructure and a substantial increase in the resource transfer to states, keeping in view the two-fold objectives of promoting inclusive growth and strengthening \ufb01 scal federalism. This has necessitated a deviation from the \ufb01 scal consolidation trajectory in 2015-16 and an extension of the period of convergence to the 3 per cent target for the gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit (GFD) as a proportion to GDP by one year. The budgeted reduction in GFD in 2015-16 re\ufb02 ects the combined impact of a compression in plan revenue expenditure and an increase in non-debt capital receipts. The CSO\u2019s advance estimates of gradual pick-up in the growth of gross \ufb01 xed capital formation in 2014-15 do not appear to be supported by its quarterly estimates which indicate deceleration in Q2 and Q3 (Table III.1). Although production of capital goods and non-oil non- gold imports gathered some momentum in Q4, a big push in investment is essential for the economy to break out of the vicious cycle of supply constraints, stranded investments, stressed bank balance sheets, risk aversion and weak demand (Chart III.2). Progress on speedier project clearances is, however, yet to materalise (Chart III.3). The gross domestic saving rate in the economy has declined sharply over the last two years. The decline was on account of lower savings in physical assets by the household sector, mainly construction (Chart III.4). The contribution of net exports to overall GDP growth turned negative since Q2 on contraction in exports and some pick-up in imports. Exports shrank in Q3 on weak global demand and the sharp fall in international crude oil prices which affected exports of petroleum products (POL) [accounting for around 19 per cent of total merchandise exports]. Non-oil exports also added to overall contraction as price realisation declined considerably with the fall in international commodity prices (Chart III.5). With imports growing at a modest pace, the trade de\ufb01 cit widened in Q3 of 2014-15, though it was partly offset by improved net services exports (Chart III.6). During January and February 2015, the faster decline in imports relative to exports signi\ufb01 cantly reduced the trade de\ufb01 cit. Net services exports during January 2015 were, however, lower than in the preceding month as well as a year ago. In the \ufb01 nancial account of India\u2019s balance of payments, capital \ufb02 ows remained strong during Q3. Though equity \ufb02 ows weakened during the quarter, it was more than offset by the large accretion under banking capital as banks liquidated their overseas foreign currency assets. In Q4, the improved investment climate foreign direct investment, which dominated net capital \ufb02 ows. Portfolio investment \ufb02 ows rose sharply to US$ 13.6 billion during Q4 from a relatively subdued level of about US$ 6 billion in the preceding quarter. A surge was evident in equity as well as debt investment by foreign institutional investors (FIIs). Similarly, foreign revived portfolio and direct investment rose to US$ 5.5 billion during January 2015, more than twice the monthly average in the preceding quarter. With net capital \ufb02 ows being signi\ufb01 cantly larger than the external \ufb01 nancing requirement, foreign exchange reserves rose to a peak level of US$ 343.0 billion by April 03, 2015. In terms of traditional metrics of foreign exchange reserve adequacy \u2013 import cover and the Greenspan- Guidotti rule for short-term debt cover \u2013 India has exhibited steady improvement. The import cover of reserves went up to 8.1 months at end-December 2014 from 7.8 months at end-March 2014 while the ratio of short-term debt to reserves improved to 26.7 per cent at end-December 2014 from 30.1 per cent at end- March 2014 (Table III.3). Further, net forward purchases of US$ 5.6 billion and bilateral swap arrangements with Japan and among the BRICS provide additional cover against external shocks. The CSO\u2019s new series of national accounts aligns with internationally recognised best standards in terms of the United Nations\u2019 Systems of National Accounts (SNA, 2008) and also improves data coverage. Output measured by gross value added (GVA) at basic prices is, however, in dissonance with various metrics tracked as either coincident or leading indicators in terms of both level and growth rates (Box III.1). In particular, the conventional indicators of corporate performance that are used to re\ufb02 ect movements in output and 1. External Debt to GDP ratio (%) 2.

From the supply side, agricultural activity slowed down through 2014-15, as the delayed onset of south- west monsoon, its uneven distribution and de\ufb01 ciency\u2013 especially in the early part of the season\u2013affected kharif crops. GDP from agriculture and allied activities contracted by 0.4 per cent in Q3 (Table III.4). Initial expectations that the shortfall in the kharif harvest may be compensated by rabi crops did not materialise due to inadequate replenishing of soil moisture and reservoirs by Q3 and Q4, aggravated by a de\ufb01 cient and unevenly distributed north-east monsoon. Re\ufb02 ecting these factors, the second advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture indicate that the production of foodgrains declined by 3.2 per cent, and oilseeds by 8.9 per cent in 2014-15. Within foodgrains, the production of rice declined by 3.4 per cent and pulses by 6.8 per cent. Furthermore, unseasonal rains and hailstorms in early March are likely to affect agriculture production adversely. Even though the performance of allied activities is expected to remain stable, it remains to be seen whether they can compensate for the shortfall in agricultural production. The industrial sector shrugged off stagnation and grew for the second consecutive year in 2014-15. An analysis of the quarterly data, however, suggests deceleration in growth of mining and quarrying and manufacturing. This implies that the industrial sector would have to have grown by about 9 per cent and manufacturing by around 11 per cent in Q4 to meet the CSO\u2019s projections for 2014-15 as a whole, which looks ambitious on the basis of information available so far. Core industries, which supply crucial inputs to other industries and have a weight of nearly 38 per cent in the index of industrial production (IIP), have been decelerating since December 2014, underlining the weakness in the growth drivers. Structural constraints have led to persistent declines in the production of core industries such as steel, natural gas, crude oil and fertilizers. The contraction in mining and quarrying and slowdown in electricity generation in the IIP highlight these constraints. As per the use-based classi\ufb01 cation, the growth in industrial production was driven by basic goods and capital goods. Lumpy and \ufb02 uctuating capital goods production industrial production. As discussed earlier in the chapter, the slowdown in consumer goods points to weak demand re\ufb02 ected in private \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure. imparted The revival in overall growth in 2014-15 hinged primarily around the services sector, which is estimated to have grown by 9.8 per cent. Quarterly analysis suggests that growth picked up steam from Q2 and strengthened further in Q3 led by \u2018\ufb01 nancial, real estate and professional services\u2019 and \u2018public in an administration and defence\u2019. However, (NSC) had The National Statistical Commission recommended a change in base year for all key economic data every \ufb01 ve years to account for structural changes in the economy. In line with this recommendation, the base year for national accounts in India was recently revised to 2011-12 (from 2004-05 earlier), as the year 2009-10 was not considered a normal year in view of the global \ufb01 nancial crisis. In the new series, GDP at market prices \u2013 instead of GDP at factor cost - is the headline number reported as a measure of economic activity international practices. Furthermore, \u2018Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices\u2019 \u2013 instead of GDP at factor cost \u2013 is the headline measure of activity from the supply side. Other changes in the series include, inter alia, comprehensive coverage of the corporate sector in both manufacturing and services as per the database available in the e-governance initiative viz. MCA-21 of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), improved coverage of rural and urban local bodies, and incorporation of recent National Sample Surveys (NSS). Consequent upon these changes, nominal levels of GDP on the new base are lower relative to the old base. Growth rates of both nominal and real GDP on the new base are higher for each year. In terms of commonly used indicators of productivity \u2013 the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) \u2013 the new series reveals a signi\ufb01 cant improvement, but this is not corroborated by the behaviour of other indicators, especially in an environment characterized by declining national savings, investment and general concerns about stalled projects (Chart a). In the manufacturing sector, GVA growth is much higher in the new series than in the earlier series. The growth of this sector appears to have been driven by the unorganised sector, which grew by 23.3 per cent in 2012-13. Data for subsequent year, however, suggests a slowdown sector, with the unorganised manufacturing growth driven mainly by the organised sector (Table III.B.1). While the use of MCA-21 database could explain differences up to 2013-14, the advance estimates for 2014-15 have used corporate sector data \u2013 from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) \u2013 in four key components of GDP, namely manufacturing, trade, hotels and restaurant, and real estate. An analysis of sequential \ufb02 ow of information on corporate earnings for Q3 of 2014-15 indicates that earnings growth has been much weaker than what is implied in the new series (Chart b). Services tax collection has also remained weak. A high growth of 13.7 per cent (at constant prices) in \u201c\ufb01 nancial, real estate and business services\u201d re\ufb02 ects a possible upward bias in estimation. It is expected that the revised estimates for 2014-15 to be released by end-May 2015 will incorporate better information covering the second half of the year and provide greater clarity on the state of economic activity at the aggregate level.

The critical issue is: do recent revisions to India\u2019s national accounts capture this phenomenon? Empirical assessment suggests that overestimation of potential output can be costly, in terms of greater macroeconomic volatility and/or an acceleration of in\ufb02 ation getting entrenched (IMF, 2011)2. A production function approach to estimating potential output indicates a sharp decline in the contribution of total factor productivity to potential output. Various time series estimates of potential output \u2013 without imposing any a priori judgment relating to the structural interpretation of the new GVA series \u2013 suggest that in terms of levels, the output gap has remained negative since 2012-13, although the gap is gradually closing (Box III.2). on the same variable for the same year computed at different times conveying different trends. The recent revisions in national accounts pose a challenge in terms of assessing the state of the business cycle and the position at which the economy is poised on it. Key to the setting of policies that modulate aggregate demand is a good \u2018\ufb01 x\u2019 on the level of output relative The latest round of the Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank reveals that capacity utilisation (CU) remained range-bound in Q3 of 2014-15 as compared to the previous quarter and declined over its level a year ago (Chart III.7). to the economy\u2019s potential. Estimating potential output from historical data is dif\ufb01 cult even in the best of times. It has become much more complex in the An overall assessment of the state of the real economy points to recovery gaining ground slowly. Signi\ufb01 cant output across the world is likely to have fallen, led by 2 International Monetary Fund (2011). World Economic Outlook, Chapter 1, April. Empirical estimates of the output gap at the aggregate level and indicator/survey based information for major sectors of the economy can provide an assessment of slack in the economy. Potential output3, however, is dif\ufb01 cult to measure and is subject to estimation errors. The recent revision in national accounts data which shows major level differences in old and new series (at constant prices) for the last four years (2011-12 to 2014-15) imparts further complexity to the estimation, given the lack of data for previous years under the new series. In the absence of high-frequency and regularly updated data on capital stock and labour in the Indian context, estimates of potential growth through a structural production function approach can, at best, be regarded as indicative rather than de\ufb01 nitive, with the results suggesting a sharp decline in the contribution of total factor productivity, as set out earlier. A useful alternative to the production function approach is to use time series methods that can estimate potential output solely from information contained in the past data, however short their history may be. Use of various univariate \ufb01 ltering techniques such as Hodrick-Prescott (HP) and Kalman \ufb01 lters, and a multivariate \ufb01 lter constructed from spliced quarterly GVA series, indicate that the output gap (i.e., actual output minus potential output) has been negative since 2012-13, irrespective of the technique (Chart a). slack and structural rigidities continue to hold back a sharp revival in investment demand. Lack of certainty about cash \ufb02 ows from new investment projects is contributing to the lacklustre investment cycle. Unless structural reforms unleash productivity gains going forward, lower saving and investment rates could become a risk to stronger recovery. Recent reform measures in the infrastructure sector, including on national highways, target-based progress encouraging FDI in railways and defence, plans to start power plants in the private sector with all the requisite approvals amendments in the Land Acquisition Act to expedite project clearances and coal block auctions are expected to address infrastructure bottlenecks and boost medium term growth prospects. in place, bringing 3 Potential output is generally de\ufb01 ned as the full capacity level of output or sustainable level of output in which the intensity of resource use is non-in\ufb02 ationary. While potential growth is the growth in the potential output, the output gap is the deviation of actual output from its potential level and is expressed as a percentage of potential output. Amidst abundant global liquidity and risk-on risk-off fluctuations in investor appetite, financial markets in India rallied strongly in the second half of 2014-15, supported by improvement in domestic macroeconomic conditions. Liquidity was comfortable in all segments and this was reflected in a pick-up in turnover, softening of interest rates, an appreciating bias in the exchange rate of the rupee and equity markets scaling historic highs. Since the MPR of September 2014, domestic \ufb01 nancial markets have been buoyed through Q3 and Q4 of 2014-15 by the global search for yields as fears of imminent normalisation of US monetary policy receded and ultra-accommodative monetary easing commenced in the euro area and Japan. Barring sporadic volatility sparked by incoming data, India became a preferred destination in portfolio reallocations, with discernible differentiation vis-\u00e0-vis other EMEs. Liquidity conditions were expansionary in all segments, spurring trading activity. In the money markets, interest rates eased during Q3, barring intermittent spikes around the third week of October due to festival-related pick-up in currency demand, and again in the second half of December on account of advance tax payments and quarter-end balance sheet adjustments. The shift in the monetary policy stance steered by two cuts in the policy repo rate enabled interest rates to ease further during Q4. Pro-active liquidity management under the new operating procedure of monetary policy has played a key role in the seamless transmission of policy impulses through the money markets. There has also been a marked ebbing of daily volatility measured through generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), although these estimates for the end of 2014-15 tend to be strongly in\ufb02 uenced by the year-end spike in call rates (Chart IV.1). In this context, the Agreement on the Monetary Policy Framework enjoins the Reserve Bank to set out in the public domain the operating target and procedure of monetary policy and any changes therein that are effected from time to time (Box IV.1). Other money market segments moved in consonance with the call money market. With the steady migration of activity to collateralised segments, viz., collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (CBLO) and market repo, call money volumes have thinned, currently accounting for about 10-11 per cent of the total overnight volume (Chart IV.2). This re\ufb02 ects preference for collateralised funding as well as improvements in the microstructure such as co-terminus settlement of market repo and outright trade in Government securities. Trading in the call money market tends to be skewed by its microstructure \u2013 over 70 per cent of the activity is concentrated in the opening hour and closing hour of trading; top \ufb01 ve borrowers accounting for about 50 per cent of total daily call volumes on average (Chart IV.3). These features have occasionally accentuated volatility in the call money market, particularly in Q4. The \ufb01 xed overnight repurchase (repo) rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) is the single monetary policy rate. days to even out frictional liquidity mismatches that occur in spite of assured liquidity operations; and (iii) outright open market operations through auctions and anonymous screen-based trading on the Negotiated Dealing System- Order Matching (NDS-OM) platform to manage enduring liquidity mismatches. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) is the operating target of monetary policy. Once the policy rate is announced in the Bank\u2019s statements on monetary policy, the operating procedure aims at modulating liquidity conditions so as to achieve the operating target, i.e., to anchor the WACR around the policy rate. This is the \ufb01 rst leg of monetary policy transmission to the \ufb01 nancial system and the economy. Pro-active liquidity management is the mechanism through which the operating target is achieved. The main features of the revised liquidity management framework announced on August 22, 2014 and implemented since September 5 are as follows: (i) assured access to central bank liquidity of one per cent of banks\u2019 net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) comprising 0.25 per cent of NDTL provided through overnight \ufb01 xed rate repo auctions conducted daily at the policy rate, and 0.75 per cent of NDTL provided through 14-day variable rate term repo auctions conducted on every Tuesday and Friday; (ii) \ufb01 ne-tuning operations through variable rate repo/reverse repo auctions of maturities ranging from overnight to 28 Special operations are also conducted on holidays to help market participants tide over pressures emanating from one-off events such as tax payments, government spending, balance sheet adjustments and payment and settlement requirements. A Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) allows market participants to access central bank liquidity at the end of the day (including Saturdays) over and above regular and \ufb01 ne-tuning operations by using up to 2 per cent of their stipulated Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) holdings of government securities in addition to excess SLR as collateral at a rate set at 100 basis points above the policy rate. Fixed rate daily overnight reverse repo auctions are conducted at the end of the day (including Saturdays) to allow market participants to place surplus liquidity with the Reserve Bank at a rate set at 100 basis points below the policy rate. The \ufb01 xed rate daily overnight reverse repo operates as a de facto standing facility. The MSF rate and the \ufb01 xed overnight reverse repo rate de\ufb01 ne an informal corridor for limiting intra-day variations in the call rate. The market for commercial paper (CPs) picked up momentum during Q3 and Q4 (up to March 15), with issuances of CPs growing y-o-y by 25 per cent and 49 per cent, respectively. This re\ufb02 ected some substitution of short-term bank credit due to tight bank lending conditions. The weighted average discount rate of CPs softened from 8.9 per cent during the second half of September 2014 to 8.5 per cent in the second half of January 2015, before hardening to 8.8 per cent in the \ufb01 rst half of March 2015. In the Government securities (G-sec) market, yields softened through Q3, barring some spikes during the second half of December 2014 due to the Ukrainian crisis followed by the Russian currency crisis. Buoyant investor sentiment conditioned by the ongoing disin\ufb02 ation in India and expectations of monetary policy easing helped the market to shrug off the impact of the Federal Reserve completely exiting quantitative easing (QE) in October. The OPEC\u2019s decision in November 2014 not to cut production strengthened market sentiment and reinforced the decline in G-sec yields. During the global sell-off triggered by the depreciation of the Ruble, however, the 10-year generic yield jumped by 15 basis points on December 16 \u2013 the largest increase on any single day during the second half of 2014-15. As the Russian currency crisis abated, G-sec yields declined in Q4, aided by the softness in international crude oil prices, fall in US treasury yields and resumption of flows into the domestic foreign exchange market. G-sec yields hardened transiently in response to the reduction in the SLR in February and the broadly unchanged size of the market borrowing programme announced in the Union Budget. As in the past, recourse to Treasury Bill auctions in February and March, notwithstanding large redemptions, inverted the G-sec yield curve, re\ufb02 ecting the reluctance of market participants to part with liquidity as the balance sheet date approached. Barring these episodes, the G-sec market was range- bound during Q3 and Q4 with a downward shift in the yield curve (Chart IV.4). The 10- year yield declined by 72 basis points from 8.52 per cent at the end of September 2014 to 7.80 per cent on March 31, 2015. Foreign portfolio investors\u2019 (FPIs) investment in G-secs stood at `1,529 billion as on March 31, 2015. With the exhaustion of the limit for investment in G-secs (US$ 30 billion), FPIs invested in debt mutual funds allowed under the limit of US$ 51 billion for investment in corporate debt, indirectly expanding their investment in G-secs (Chart IV.5). Activity in the corporate bond market also gathered pace in Q3 and Q4, driven by private placements which recorded a y-o-y growth of 112 per cent. On the other hand, amounts mobilised through public issues declined through this period (up to February). The signi\ufb01 cant increase in resource mobilisation through corporate bonds could be re\ufb02 ecting substitution effects since bank credit growth has remained subdued in conjunction with tight credit conditions. FPIs\u2019 investment in corporate bonds stood at `1,890 billion as on March 31, 2015, accounting for 77 per cent of the limit, and as a consequence, secondary market trading volumes surged by 51 per cent (y-o-y) in the second half of 2014-15. Yields of AAA rated corporate bonds generally moved in tandem with G-sec yields, but hardened somewhat in March (Chart IV.6). Notwithstanding increased resource mobilisation through corporate bonds and CPs, the \ufb02 ow of \ufb01 nancial resources to the commercial sector remained lower during 2014-15 than a year ago, mainly due to the deceleration in non-food credit. In the foreign exchange market, the predominant driver has been robust capital \ufb02 ows that started from March 2014. The exchange rate of the rupee moved in a narrow range of `61.04 - 62.14 per US$ but with an upward bias through most of Q3. From December 10, however, the rupee experienced downward pressures, slipping to a recent low of `63.75 on December 30 on a combination of factors \u2013 spillovers from the Russian currency crisis; month-end purchases by oil marketing companies; pro\ufb01 t booking by FPIs; weak readings on industrial output, and the relentless strengthening of the US dollar. By the second week of January 2015, volatility in the spot market ebbed and the rupee resumed trading with an appreciating bias on the resumption of FPI \ufb02 ows, abating of the Russian currency crisis and a sharp fall in the trade de\ufb01 cit (Chart IV.7). The ECB\u2019s announcement of QE on January 22 and sustained softening of international crude oil prices added to the positive sentiment in the exchange market. In the second week of February 2015, incoming strong US non-farm payroll data set off a slide across emerging markets\u2019 currency and equity markets. Range-bound trading with modest gains followed the dovish comments from the Federal Reserve in March regarding the timeframe for raising its policy rate. In real effective terms, the rupee appreciated over its level at the end of March 2014 on account of persisting inflation differentials vis-\u00e0-vis trading partners (Table IV.1). The forward market also exhibited heightened activity in Q3, with the six-month forward premium declining from 8.16 per cent on October 9 to 7.13 per cent on December 26. In Q4, however, the forward premia hardened somewhat from the second half of February on increasing demand. Barring soft patches, equity markets rallied through the second half of 2014-15, scaling all-time highs. Indian Appreciation (+) / Depreciation (-) (per cent) 3.9 -8.6 -6.8 -12.6 -10.8 -16.3 indices were among the better performing in the world, with significantly attractive valuations relative to fundamentals and the cross-country EME experience. Some of these gains were pared during December 2014 by pessimism triggered by fears of earlier than expected reversal in the US interest rate cycle, uncertainty relating to Greece and geo-political tensions in the Ukraine and the Middle East. Equity markets, however, started gaining again from the beginning of January 2015 on resumption of portfolio investment \ufb02 ows (Chart IV.8). Buoyant sentiment bounced back with the Reserve Bank\u2019s announcement of a cut in the policy repo rate on January 15, and the BSE Sensex reached a historic high closing at 29,682 on January 29, 2015. In the early part of February, equity markets gave up some gains on concerns following the results of Delhi elections, weak results reported by some big corporates, poor Chinese trade data and decline in European stocks. In the second half of the month, however, equity markets recovered and gained strength with the announcement of the Union Budget 2015-16 as also passing of key legislations relating to coal, mining and insurance susequently. During March 2015, the stock market eased moderately on global cues. In the primary market, Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) was moderate at `41 billion while equity and debt issues declined to `34 billion during Q3. On the other hand, private placements of corporate bonds and mutual funds spurted to `1,240 billion and `574 billion, respectively. There has already been some improvement in resource mobilisation in Q4 in response to investment-friendly measures announced in the Union Budget 2015-16 and steps taken by the SEBI to streamline existing regulations relating to public shareholding of state-owned companies. In the credit market, subdued activity in the \ufb01 rst half of the year picked up from Q3 as banks shifted their portfolios towards retail lending, especially housing. Credit \ufb02 ow to the industrial sector \u2013 particularly to food processing and basic metals \u2013 and services, also improved modestly (Chart IV.9). Re\ufb02 ecting the generally sluggish demand for credit as also regulatory requirements relating to the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), banks\u2019 investments in G-secs, on the other hand, showed a sharp increase during 2014-15. Excess SLR holdings of banks increased significantly as a consequence. Banks have been rebalancing their lending portfolio away from sectors in which their assets are under stress to relatively stress free sectors such as retail housing and automobiles. Following the 50 basis points reduction in the policy rate in Q4, 22 banks have reduced their median term deposit rates in the range of 7-53 bps while 14 banks reduced their base rates in the range of 10-50 bps. Broad money (M3) growth remained low during Q3 and Q4. With credit and deposit growth moving broadly in tandem, liquidity conditions in the system remained comfortable throughout, barring transient liquidity mismatches due to frictional factors alluded to earlier (Chart IV.10). Currency demand started picking up since Q3 with the festival season and drained some liquidity, but timely liquidity provision by the Reserve Bank smoothened these short-lived spikes. The provision of primary liquidity was augmented by the large expansion in net foreign assets of the Reserve Bank. Active sterilisation operations, however, contained the growth of reserve money (Chart IV.11). Liquidity conditions improved during Q3 of 2014-15, re\ufb02 ecting a con\ufb02 uence of structural and frictional factors, barring temporary pressures around festival days, mid-December advance tax payments and quarter- end window dressing. In Q4, liquidity conditions tightened since the second week of January 2015 with cutbacks in government spending, pick-up in credit demand and seasonal increase in currency demand. The Reserve Bank\u2019s pro-active liquidity management operations ensured that the call rates stayed range bound around the policy rate, reducing day-to-day volatility (Chart IV.12). In pursuance of the Dr. Urjit R. Patel Committee\u2019s recommendation to move away from sector-speci\ufb01 c re\ufb01 nance, the export credit re\ufb01 nance (ECR) limit was reduced in three phases starting June 2014 and \ufb01 nally subsumed in the provision of system level liquidity with effect from February 7, 2015. As a further measure to facilitate smoother operations, the Reserve Bank started conducting reverse repo and MSF operations on all Saturdays, effective February 21, 2015. Overall, \ufb01 nancial markets traded on a bullish note during the second half of 2014-15 against the backdrop of improved domestic fundamentals and a global appetite for risk. The evolution of overall global liquidity conditions has been conditioned by expectations relating to high intensity events such as the lift-off of US interest rates, monetary accommodation elsewhere and geo-political flashpoints. Liquidity conditions remained stable and movements in the overnight call money rate were, by and large, anchored around the policy repo rate. Global economic recovery remained tepid and divergent across economies, with most EMEs experiencing slowdown. While AEs remain susceptible to the risk of deflation, inflationary pressures subsided in key EMEs giving leeway for easing monetary policy. Global commodity prices continue to decline. Financial markets were buoyant but volatile in pricing in policy developments in major economies. In the months following the MPR of September 2014, global economic activity appears to be stabilising, but with markedly divergent growth pro\ufb01 les between advanced and emerging economies, and between commodity exporters and importers. The collapse of international commodity prices, especially of crude oil, seems to have reallocated demand across economies. Monetary policy stances across countries have been including unconventionally, and market easing, expectations on the timing of the US monetary policy normalisation have been pushed back. In response, there have been large movements in exchange rates and other asset prices. Re\ufb02 ecting risk appetite and search for yield, long-term yields have fallen to record lows amidst heightened volatility in \ufb01 nancial markets. For commodity exporters, however, risk spreads have widened and currency depreciations have been sizable. Thus, even though \ufb01 nancial conditions are easy and are being re\ufb02 ected in \ufb01 nancial asset prices, the outlook for global growth remains moderate, held back by still-weak demand. In the United States, growth has been \ufb01 rming up, aided by improving labour and housing market conditions. The sharp appreciation in the US dollar in recent months could, however, dampen prospects for exports. In the Euro area, economic conditions remain weak although some pick-up in Q4 of 2014 and the early months of 2015 is being observed, supported by lower crude prices and the depreciation in the euro as well as increased bank lending. The contraction of activity in Japan moderated in the \ufb01 nal quarter of 2014, with mixed signals from higher frequency data in the beginning of 2015 - consumer con\ufb01 dence and exports show improvement, but retail sales and industrial production have contracted. Most EMEs continue to decelerate due to subdued external demand, political uncertainties and domestic 0.4 1.4 0.7 3.0 1.2 0.6 0.2 not seasonally adjusted Sources: OECD, IMF and Bloomberg. supply-side constraints. In China, activity has slowed over the second half of 2014 and Q1 of 2015 as investment demand lost pace and the real estate sector weakened on deleveraging and \ufb01 nancial repair among households and corporations. The Russian economy slowed sharply due to falling oil prices and Western sanctions. Contraction continues in Brazil as high in\ufb02 ation squeezes domestic demand. Falling oil and commodity prices also weighed on growth prospects of countries in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Latin America (Table V.1). Overall, although the near-term outlook is improving slowly, AEs are yet to fully recover from the after- effects of the global \ufb01 nancial crisis. EMEs face the challenge of addressing persistent negative output gaps and falling growth potential, which yields a more subdued near-term outlook for them. In fact, the sluggish global recovery over the course of 2014 and 2015 so far has warranted successive downward adjustments to forecasts the world over, raising concerns of \u2018secular stagnation\u2019 (Box V.I). Despite ultra accommodative monetary policies pursued for a considerable period, AEs continue to languish, raising fears that they may be suffering from secular stagnation. The theory of secular stagnation (Hansen, 1939) is Keynesian in emphasising the role of de\ufb01 cient demand evident in a saving glut. Supply-side factors are also at play in stagnating long-run growth - slow population growth and shrinking working-age labour supply; slow technological progress; and low returns on human capital (Gordon, 2014). The combination of these forces is driving down AEs to an equilibrium trap of lower investment and lower potential growth. Thus, the slowdown in AEs is more of a structural phenomenon, rather than a cyclical outcome of the \ufb01 nancial crisis. On the other hand, deleveraging in the \ufb01 nancial sector, balance sheet repair and resolution is taking its toll on growth in AEs (Chart V.B.1). considered. Has the future potential of the economy become impaired? Slower total factor productivity accounts for the smallest part of the downward trend in potential, whereas the largest part is associated with reduced capital investment, followed closely by reduced labour input. Similar evidence is discernible in the case of Japan and Europe. Changes in the structure of the economy have also led to a signi\ufb01 cant shift in the natural balance between saving and investment, causing a decline in the equilibrium or normal real rate of interest that is associated with full employment (King and Low, 2014). This could portend increased vulnerability to \ufb01 nancial stability in the future on a global basis. These developments suggest that as a long-term strategy, employing monetary policy to raise potential output appears to have reached its limits. Raising the level of demand through regulatory and tax reforms that would promote private investment, policies that promote exports and public investments could be a more effective strategy. Model simulations for the US suggest that a one per cent increase in the budget de\ufb01 cit directed at government spending maintained for \ufb01 ve years produces a substantial demand response even after allowing for labour withdrawal effects (Chart V.B.3) - the potential multiplier can be quite large - with a reduction in the long-run debt to GDP ratio (Summers, 2014b). It has been argued that potential output in the US economy is now 10 per cent below its level in 2007 (Chart V.B.2), i.e., no progress has been made in restoring GDP to its potential (Summers, 2014a). The aggregate employment/population ratio tends to corroborate this view, even when the working age population is The jury is still out on whether or not AEs face secular stagnation. An alternative view is that it is just a prolonged business cycle, re\ufb02 ection of temporary headwinds and misguided \ufb01 scal contraction (Beckworth, 2014). Understandably, there is no consensus on the appropriate policy responses: \ufb01 scal policy to stimulate aggregate demand through infrastructure investment; persistently low interest rates to encourage demand; (Contd...) structural reforms to address supply side constraints; technological innovations (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014) or a judicious combination. Beckworth, D. (2014), \u201cHere\u2019s why Larry Summers is wrong about secular stagnation\u201d, Wall Street Journal. The pace of global trade continues to be weighed down by both cyclical and structural factors, with world trade volume growing by only 3.1 per cent in 2014 - well below the pre-crisis trend (IMF, 2015).1 The impact of the growth slowdown in China, Russia, the Euro area and Japan on world trade has been signi\ufb01 cant, aggravated by weaker activity in some major oil exporters. Even though world trade growth is expected to pick up moderately along with improvement in global output in 2015 (IMF, 2015), risks continue to tilt downwards, given the subdued conditions characterising global demand and international commodity prices. Incoming data on most EMEs show contraction in exports in the \ufb01 rst two months of 2015. In\ufb02 ation continues to drift downward in AEs and many EMEs albeit in varying degrees.

The Euro area is struggling to emerge out of a de\ufb02 ationary spiral with CPI in\ufb02 ation of (-)0.1 per cent in March. In the US and the UK, in\ufb02 ation has been declining since the second half of 2014, with zero in\ufb02 ation in February in both countries. For the UK, low food and fuel prices have been the prime factors for keeping in\ufb02 ation low. In the US, appreciation of the dollar has also had a disin\ufb02 ationary effect. In Japan too, CPI in\ufb02 ation has shrugged off the effects of the hike in the consumption tax in April 2014 and has steadily fallen to 2.2 per cent, primarily driven down by falling commodity prices (Chart V.1a). Although EMEs, in general, have bene\ufb01 ted from the sharp fall in commodity prices, in\ufb02 ation has remained stubbornly high in a few countries. While China faces the risk of de\ufb02 ation due to weak domestic demand and falling factory prices, the slump in oil prices has given some respite to in\ufb02 ation in Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey. By contrast, in\ufb02 ationary pressures remain high in Brazil and Russia, attributable to domestic factors and substantial currency depreciation (Chart V.1b). Since August 2014, strong supply positions have led to a drastic fall in world energy prices, with Brent and WTI crude oil prices falling below US$ 50 per barrel in January 2015 (Chart V.2). Since then there have been intermittent bouts of volatility, driven by factors such as decline in US rig counts, relatively positive data on the US economy and disturbances in the Middle East. Most non-energy prices have also been on a steady decline. Global food prices continue to slide downward, underpinned by strong production expectations, robust inventories, the strong US dollar and limited demand from major importers like China. Looking ahead, commodity prices will likely remain stable as slack in the global economy persists. Tepid and uneven economic recovery across major economies could intensify disin\ufb02 ationary pressures. On the other hand, monetary policy easing measures undertaken by major central banks should support demand. combination of de\ufb02 ationary/ Faced by disin\ufb02 ationary pressures growth, and weak central banks in both AEs and EMEs have pursued accommodative monetary policies. In the US, monetary policy remains highly accommodative with interest rates close to zero even after the cessation of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases in October. Notwithstanding forward guidance in March setting the stage for lifting its policy rate, markets anticipate a relaxed approach from the Fed in this regard. Facing persistent de\ufb02 ation, the Bank of Japan has continued with its target of monetary base expansion of 80 trillion yen per year. The ECB began its asset purchase programme since March 2015 which, in turn, has produced sizable depreciation of the euro and taken long-term bond yields to new lows. Some countries have resorted to negative interest rate policy to counter high real interest rates arising due to de\ufb02 ationary pressures (Chart V.3a). Many EMEs have eased their policy stances as in\ufb02 ationary pressures subsided on weak domestic demand and the sharp fall in energy prices. China followed up deposit/lending rate cuts in November 2014 and February with reduction in reserve requirements in February and other measures to reduce \ufb01 nancing costs. Other EMEs such as Thailand and Korea have also reduced policy rates in quick succession to protect their external competitiveness. Turkey and Indonesia eased their policy rates as the in\ufb02 ation outlook improved. Stricken severely by the fall in global oil prices and Western sanctions, Russia cut its policy rate twice in Q1 of 2015 (January and March). Brazil has been an exception, relentlessly raising policy rates up to a six-year high in March; a weakening currency has further exacerbated already high in\ufb02 ationary pressures (Chart V.3b). Yet most policy shifts by central banks have been apparently driven by the weak economy and exchange rate concerns rather than \ufb01 nancial stability, implying competitive devaluations. Financial markets have been volatile since mid-2014, triggered by data releases in the US and the Fed\u2019s statements on the normalisation of monetary policy. Political tensions in Europe relating to Greece, lower oil prices and country-speci\ufb01 c events have also impacted investor sentiment. Unprecedented low interest rates and compressed risk premia have led to a precipitous fall in long-term government bond yields while raising most asset prices to near record highs as the search for yield pushed investors to riskier assets (Chart V.4a). Further easing of monetary policy propped up global equity markets in Q1 of 2015, particularly in AEs, albeit preceded by bouts of volatility in the second half of 2014 (Chart V.4b). Capital \ufb02 ows to EMEs subsided in the second half of 2014, as growth remained lacklustre. Falling commodity prices and the shifting trajectory of US monetary policy heightened risk aversion. However, portfolio \ufb02 ows to a few EMEs rebounded in Q1 of 2015 following the announcement of the ECB\u2019s QE programme. With markets reading Fed\u2019s forward guidance in its March statement as dovish, volatility returned in portfolio \ufb02 ows to EMEs and investors tended to discriminate against countries with relatively weaker domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. The US dollar has gained against major currencies and most EME currencies. Since end-June 2014, the dollar index has gained about 20 per cent both in nominal and real terms against major currencies. In sum, the uncertainty surrounding near-term prospects and the underlying drivers of future crude oil prices have added a new dimension to the global growth outlook. While on the upside, lower oil prices could spur global demand by increasing the purchasing power of oil importers, on the \ufb02 ipside, oil exporters could be adversely affected. With divergent monetary policy stances across major economies, risks related to shifts in market sentiment and resultant bouts of volatility in capital \ufb02 ows and currency markets remain elevated. ", "file6": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 7.5 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); and continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.5 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 8.5 per cent. 2. Since 2014-15\u2019s sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of February, a moderate and uneven global recovery is emerging, with economies being buffeted (or supported) by currency fluctuations and commodity prices. Growth in the United States is likely to have been weak in the first quarter of calendar 2015, partly because of US dollar appreciation, but is expected to strengthen. The Euro area has started to show modest improvement, supported by a boost to demand from lower crude prices and the depreciation of the euro as well as easing financial and credit conditions following the commencement of quantitative easing. With the waning of the impact of the consumption tax increase, growth turned positive in Japan in Q4 of 2014 and consumer confidence and exports picked up. However, retail sales and industrial production contracted, indicating that the outlook is still weak. Growth fragilities and macroeconomic continues imbalances. This will have regional and global ramifications, although the softness in international commodity prices is providing some offset for net importers while adversely impacting net exporters. Global growth is likely to firm up through 2015 and 2016, supported by stronger recovery in the advanced economies (AEs) and soft energy prices. Downside risks mainly emanate from the slowdown in China, geopolitical risks surrounding oil prices and the uneven effects of currency and commodity price movements. financial 3. Global financial markets have been boosted by expectations of normalisation of US monetary policy being pushed back into late 2015, monetary policy stances turning highly accommodative in other AEs, and several emerging market economies (EMEs) easing policy rates to address growth concerns. Long-term yields have declined to all-time lows on weak inflation expectations, compression of term premiums and the safe haven allure of US Treasuries. Ultra low interest rates and reduction in risk premia have raised most asset prices to record highs, and have pushed investors to riskier assets such as equity and lower rated debt instruments. Exchange rates have experienced large and volatile movements, with the US dollar strengthening against most currencies. Among EMEs, markets have tended to discriminate against those with relatively weaker fundamentals and/or oil exporters. Nevertheless, with high portfolio flows to EMEs, risks from sudden shifts in market sentiment have increased. 4. Domestic economic activity is likely to have strengthened in Q4. Second advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture suggest that the contraction in food grains production in 2014-15 may turn out to be less than earlier anticipated. However, the adverse impact of unseasonal rains and hailstorms in March is still unfolding. Initial estimates indicate that as much as 17 per cent of the sown area under the rabi crop may have been affected though the precise extent of the damage remains to be determined. The growth in allied activities is likely to remain strong as in the recent past, though it remains to be seen whether it will fully compensate the decline in food grains output. 5. The industrial sector, and in particular, manufacturing appears to be regaining momentum, with the growth of production in positive territory for three consecutive months till January. While basic goods production has been expanding steadily since November 2013, capital goods output has been relatively lumpy and volatile, and more positive readings are needed to be confident about a durable pick-up in investment demand. The persisting contraction in consumer durables production for over two years could be reflecting the underlying weakness in consumption demand as well as higher imports. 6. Mixed signals are coming from the service sector. While the national accounts statistics seem to suggest that consumption demand for services is robust relative to the demand for goods, and purchasing managers perceive activity expanding on new orders, various coincident indicators of services sector activity including railway and port traffic, domestic and international passenger traffic, international freight traffic, tourist arrivals, motorcycle and tractor sales as well as bank credit and deposit growth remain subdued. 7. Retail inflation measured by the year-on-year changes in the revised consumer price index (CPI) firmed up for the third successive month in February as favourable base effects dissipated, despite the price index remaining virtually flat since December. The still elevated levels of prices of protein-rich items such as pulses, meat, fish and milk kept food inflation from following the seasonal decline in prices of vegetables and fruits. The prices of items such as sugar and edible oil moderated in consonance with the downturn in global commodity prices. Fuel inflation edged up for the second month in a row due to the increase in prices of electricity and firewood. 8. Inflation excluding food and fuel fell successively in the nine months till February. A large part of this disinflation has been on account of the slump in international crude oil prices feeding through into domestic prices of petrol and diesel that are included under the category transport and communication. Inflation in respect of housing has also eased in part reflecting in improvements. Furthermore, upside pressures methodological and coverage affecting prices of services such as education, health and other services have also fallen on account of weak demand conditions. The rate of growth of rural wages has come off substantially from the double digit levels that prevailed up to November 2013. Firms are also reporting a substantial easing of input price pressures, barring the most recent purchasing manager surveys. Reflecting past disinflation, inflation expectations of households are in single digits, although they too exhibit some firming up in Q4 in response to the turning up of food and fuel inflation during January- February. the revised CPI, 9. Since the shift in the monetary policy stance in January towards accommodation, the Reserve Bank has moved to ensure comfortable liquidity conditions through pro-active liquidity management, including fine-tuning operations on week days and access to the MSF and fixed rate reverse repo on Saturdays. This has helped to smooth the liquidity frictions that characterise events such as advance tax payments and balance sheet dates, keeping the money market rates anchored to the repo rate. In order to alleviate the pressures that build up in March on account of frictional factors, the Reserve Bank augmented its liquidity management instruments by engaging in repos of maturities ranging from 8 to 28 days cumulating to an outstanding amount of `1430 billion (including support from the MSF of `416 billion) at end-March in addition to regular 14-day term repo auctions and fixed rate overnight repos. The availability of liquidity can be gauged from the fact that in March, average daily liquidity returned by market participations through variable/fixed rate reverse repos amounted to `293 billion. 10. Export performance has been progressively weakening and contraction set in on both non-oil and petroleum product exports since December 2014. Fragile external demand conditions and the softness in international commodity prices have taken a heavy toll, as in several other EMEs in Asia. In particular, price realisations have been eroded, despite export volumes going up. With the Indian rupee gaining in real effective terms, export margins are coming under pressure for those exporters without substantial imported inputs. Net terms of trade gains and compression in imports of petroleum products have narrowed the trade deficit in the last three months to its lowest level since 2009-10. Gold imports remained contained; although non-oil non-gold imports grew at a modest pace in these months, they may be reflecting substitution effects in view of the sluggishness in domestic manufacturing. 11. Exports of services, particularly, software and travel have provided a silver lining and have helped to hold down the current account deficit (CAD) which has narrowed in Q3. This improvement has likely extended into Q4. As a result, capital inflows \u2013 mainly portfolio flows into domestic debt and equity markets and foreign direct investment \u2013 have exceeded the external financing requirement and enabled accretion to the foreign exchange reserves which reached an all-time peak of US$ 343 billion as on April 3, 2015. These reserves, including forward purchases that will be delivered over the next few months, provide some buffer against potential capital outflows when monetary policy normalisation in AEs commences. Good macroeconomic policy will, of course, be the critical first line of defence in retaining investor confidence. 12. In 2015 so far, the inflation path has evolved along the projected path after a sizable undershoot of the January 2015 target. CPI inflation is projected at its current levels in the first quarter of 2015-16, moderating thereafter to around 4 per cent by August but firming up to reach 5.8 per cent by the end of the year (Chart 1). There are upside risks to the central projection emanating from possible intensification of el ni\u00f1o conditions leading to a less than normal monsoon; large deviations in vegetable and fruit prices from their regular seasonal patterns, given unseasonal rains; larger than anticipated administered price revisions; faster closing of the output gap; geo- political developments leading to hardening of global commodity prices; and spillover from external developments through exchange rate and asset price channels. However, at this juncture, these upside risks appear to be offset by downsides originating from global deflationary/disinflationary tendencies, the still soft outlook on global commodity prices; and slack in the domestic economy. 13. Transmission of policy rates to lending rates has not taken place so far despite weak credit off take and the front loading of two rate cuts. With little transmission, and the possibility that incoming data will provide more clarity on the balance of risks on inflation, the Reserve Bank will maintain status quo in its monetary policy stance in this review. 14. The Monetary Policy Framework Agreement signed by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank in February 2015 will shape the stance of monetary policy in 2015-16 and succeeding years. The Reserve Bank will stay focussed on ensuring that the economy disinflates gradually and durably, with CPI inflation targeted at 6 per cent by January 2016 and at 4 per cent by the end of 2017-18. Although the target for end-2017-18 and thereafter is defined in terms of a tolerance band of +/- 2 per cent around the mid-point, it will be the Reserve Bank\u2019s endeavour to keep inflation at or close to this mid-point, with the extended period provided for achieving the mid-point mitigating potentially adverse effects on the economy. As outlined above, several favourable forces are at work, consistent with the change in the monetary policy stance towards accommodation effected from January. The Reserve Bank\u2019s intent is to allow the disinflationary momentum to spread through the economy, but remain vigilant about any resurgence of inflationary pressures that may destabilise the progress towards the inflation objectives set in the Agreement. 15. The outlook for growth is improving gradually. Comfortable liquidity conditions should enable banks to transmit the recent reductions in the policy rate into their lending rates, thereby improving financing conditions for the productive sectors of the economy. Along with initiatives announced in the Union Budget to boost investment in infrastructure and to improve the business environment, these factors should provide confidence to private investment and, together with the conducive outlook on inflation, deliver real income gains to consumers and lower input cost advantages to corporates. GDP growth estimates of the CSO for 2014-15 already project a robust pick-up, but leading and coincident indicators suggest a downward revision of these estimates when fuller information on real activity for the last quarter becomes available. Uncertainty surrounding the arrival and distribution of the monsoon and unanticipated global developments are the two major risks to baseline growth projections. Assuming a normal monsoon, continuation of the cyclical upturn in a supportive policy environment, and no major structural change or supply shocks, output growth for 2015-16 is projected at 7.8 per cent, higher by 30 bps from 7.5 per cent in 2014-15, but with a downward bias to reflect the still subdued indicators of economic activity (Chart 2). 16. Going forward, the accommodative stance of monetary policy will be maintained, but monetary policy actions will be conditioned by incoming data. First, the Reserve Bank will await the transmission by banks of its front-loaded rate reductions in January and February into their lending rates. Second, developments in sectoral prices, especially those of food, will be monitored, as will the effects of recent weather disturbances and the likely strength of the monsoon, as the Reserve Bank stays vigilant to any threats to the disinflation that is underway. The Reserve Bank will look through both seasonal as well as base effects. Third, the Reserve Bank will look to a continuation and even acceleration of policy efforts to unclog the supply response so as to make available key inputs such as power and land. Further progress on repurposing of public spending from poorly targeted subsidies towards public investment and on reducing the pipeline of stalled investment will also be helpful for monetary accommodation. Finally, the Reserve Bank will watch for signs of normalisation of the US monetary policy, though it anticipates India is better buffered against likely volatility than in the past. in containing supply constraints and creating 17. This part of the Statement reviews the progress on various developmental and regulatory policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank in recent policy statements and also sets out new measures to be taken for strengthening the banking structure; broadening and deepening financial markets and extending the reach of financial services to all. I. Monetary Policy Framework 18. Steps taken to revise the monetary policy framework are documented in the accompanying Monetary Policy Report. 19. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the final rules on the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) in October 2014. The Reserve Bank has already started phasing in implementation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from January 2015 and is committed to the scheduled implementation of NSFR from January 1, 2018 for banks in India. The Reserve Bank proposes to issue draft guidelines on NSFR by May 15, 2015. 20. Guidelines on Countercyclical Capital Buffers (CCCB) were issued on February 5, 2015. They advised that the CCCB would be activated as and when circumstances warrant, and that the decision would normally be pre-announced with a lead time of four quarters. The framework envisages the credit-to-GDP gap as the main indicator which may be used in conjunction with other supplementary indicators such as the incremental credit-deposit (C-D) ratio for a moving period of three years, the industrial outlook survey (IOS) assessment index and the interest coverage ratio. A review and empirical testing of these indicators was carried out to assess whether activation of the CCCB is warranted. It was concluded that the overall situation does not warrant imposition of CCCB at this point of time. 21. In July 2014, banks were allowed to issue long term bonds (LTBs), with exemptions from certain regulatory pre-emptions, for lending to (i) long-term projects in infrastructure sub-sectors, and (ii) affordable housing. However, cross-holding of such bonds amongst banks is currently not permitted. On a review, it has been decided to allow banks to invest in such bonds issued by other banks, subject to the following conditions: i) banks\u2019 investment in these bonds will not be treated as \u2018assets with the ii) any single bank\u2019s holding of bonds in a particular issue will be subject to certain limits in relation to the bond issue size. Its aggregate holding of such bonds will also be subject to certain limits in relation to its own assets. iii) LTBs held for trading will reduce the bank\u2019s priority sector and liquidity benefits obtained from its own issuance of LTBs. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued shortly. 22. For monetary transmission to occur, lending rates have to be sensitive to the policy rate. With the introduction of the Base Rate on July 1, 2010 banks could set their actual lending rates on loans and advances with reference to the Base Rate. At present, banks are following different methodologies in computing their Base Rate \u2013 on the basis of average cost of funds, marginal cost of funds or blended cost of funds (liabilities). Base Rates based on marginal cost of funds should be more sensitive to changes in the policy rates. In order to improve the efficiency of monetary policy transmission, the Reserve Bank will encourage banks to move in a time-bound manner to marginal-cost-of-funds-based determination of their Base Rate. Detailed guidelines will be issued shortly. 23. The Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd., jointly floated by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA), the Foreign Exchange Dealers' Association of India (FEDAI) and the Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA), has been established as an independent benchmark administrator. This administrator will start operations by end-May 2015. Once it starts publishing various indices of market interest rates, the Reserve Bank will explore the possibility of encouraging banks to use the indices as an external benchmark for pricing bank products. 24. The Reserve Bank has been prescribing a comprehensive \u2018Calendar of Reviews\u2019 to be deliberated by the boards of banks, with significant additions to the calendar over the years. Time spent on reviews reduces the leeway for the board to discuss issues of strategic importance for banks such as product market strategy and risk management. The Committee to Review Governance of Boards of Banks in India (Chairman: Dr. P.J.Nayak) recommended that discussions in the boards of banks need to be upgraded and greater focus should be on strategic issues. It is, therefore, proposed to do away with the mandatory calendar of reviews and instead, replace it with the seven critical themes prescribed by the Nayak Committee namely, business strategy, financial reports and their integrity, risk, compliance, customer protection, financial inclusion and human resources, and leave it to the banks\u2019 boards to determine other list of items to be deliberated and periodicity thereof. 25. The need to bring in professionalism to the boards of banks cannot be overemphasized. In order to attract and retain professional directors, it is essential that they are appropriately compensated. Public sector banks follow guidelines issued by the government in this regard. The remuneration of the part-time Chairmen of private sector banks are approved specifically for each bank under the current statutory provisions. However, there is no guidance on remuneration to other non- executive directors of private sector banks. Therefore, it is proposed: to issue guidelines to private sector banks on a policy on remuneration for the non-executive directors (other than part-time Chairman) that will reflect market realities and will be within the parameters specified in the Banking Regulation Act 1949 and the Companies Act, 2013; and ii) to discuss with the Government the adoption of a similar remuneration policy 26. With a view to enlarging the scope of urban co-operative banks for expanding their business, it has been decided to allow financially sound and well managed (FSWM) scheduled urban co-operative banks, which are CBS-enabled and having minimum net worth of `100 crore, to issue credit cards. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued separately. 27. Similarly, with a view to providing greater freedom to state co-operative banks to expand their business and to provide technology-enabled services to their customers, it has been decided to permit state co-operative banks satisfying certain eligibility criteria to set up off-site ATMs/mobile ATMs without obtaining prior approval from the Reserve Bank. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued separately. 28. Several steps have been taken by the Reserve Bank to promote liquidity in the government securities (G-sec) market as recommended by the Working Group on Enhancing Liquidity in the Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives Markets (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi). These include, inter alia, a) conduct of G-sec auctions at both uniform price and multiple price formats; b) change of the settlement cycle of primary auctions for treasury bills (T-bills) from T+2 to T+1 basis; and c) re- issuance of state development loans. 29. As part of continuing measures to promote liquidity, the Reserve Bank will formulate a scheme for market making by primary dealers in semi-liquid and illiquid government securities. Details of the scheme will be worked out and implemented in consultation with market participants within the next three months. 30. Although the G-sec market is predominantly institutional in nature, the Reserve Bank has initiated several steps to promote retail/individual investments, such as the non-competitive bidding scheme, and enabling access to the Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS-OM). To increase participation of the retail and mid- segment investors in the G-sec market, gilt account holders (GAHs) were also extended web-based access to NDS-OM (secondary market trading platform) and NDS-auction platform (primary market platform) earlier. Auctions of G-secs have since moved to a more robust CBS platform (e-Kuber). Accordingly, it is now proposed to introduce a similar web-based solution for participation of all mid-segment / retail investors having gilt accounts on the e-Kuber platform. The facility is expected to be made available within the next three months. through G-secs, retail tap private savings investors/individuals could be provided direct access to both primary and secondary market platforms without any intermediary. Hence, it is proposed to explore the creation of alternate channels of distribution (e-Distribution Channels) for G-secs by the Reserve Bank. iii) The Reserve Bank has been in consultation with all stakeholders to enable seamless movement of securities from subsidiary general ledger (SGL) form to demat form and vice versa to promote trading of G-secs on stock exchanges. Concomitantly, it has also been decided to provide demat account holders a functionality to put through trades on NDS-OM. As implementation of these reforms involves multiple agencies, it is proposed to constitute an from all stakeholders to roll out the measures within a period of six months. iv) The non-competitive bidding facility available to retail investors is currently applicable only to auctions of dated securities other than Treasury Bills. In the case of Treasury Bills, a different type of non-competitive bidding is permitted only for State governments, eligible provident funds, select foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds. It is proposed to allow non- competitive bidding facility in Treasury Bills to individuals as well. Details of the facility will be worked out and implemented in consultation with the Government of India. 31. A few international financial institutions were permitted to issue rupee bonds in overseas markets, subject to certain conditions. These issues have been received with interest. The appetite for rupee debt amongst international investors is a welcome development. In view of this, it is proposed to expand, in consultation with the Government of India, the scope of such bond issues by the international financial institutions as also to permit Indian corporates eligible to raise external commercial borrowing (ECB) through issuance of rupee bonds in overseas centers with an appropriate regulatory framework. 32. Under the present regulatory framework governing foreign exchange derivatives contracts under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA), writing of options by the users on a standalone basis is not permitted. However, end-users can enter into option strategies of simultaneous buying and selling of plain vanilla European options, provided there is no net receipt of premium. With a view to encouraging hedging of forex exposures and enhancing the liquidity of the currency options market, it is proposed to permit Indian exporters and importers to write covered options on the basis of actual contracted forex exposure, subject to conditions. Detailed operating instructions shall follow separately. 33. The Reserve Bank had constituted an Internal Working Group to revisit the Priority Sector guidelines. The Working Group has since submitted its report, which was placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website for comments/suggestions.The Working Group has, inter alia, recommended specific sub-targets for small and marginal farmers and micro enterprises and inclusion of certain specific types of social infrastructure within the ambit of priority sector lending. The working Group has also recommended introduction of tradable Priority Sector Lending Certificates as another instrument to manage deficit/surplus amongst the players within the system. The Reserve Bank will take a view on the recommendations in the light of feedback received and the guidelines in this regard will be issued shortly. 34. Taking into consideration the improvement in the Micro-Finance Institutions (MFI) sector and recommendations of the Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households (Chairman: Dr. Nachiket Mor), there is a need to revise upwards the limit relating to total indebtedness of the borrower, eligible rural and semi-urban household annual incomes and loan amounts to be disbursed in the first cycle and in subsequent cycles as follows: i) Total indebtedness of a borrower, excluding educational/ medical expenses, not to exceed `1,00,000 (raised from the current limit of `50,000). ii) Loan disbursed to a borrower with a rural household annual income not exceeding `1,00,000 (enhanced from `60,000) or urban and semi-urban household income not exceeding `1,60,000 (enhanced from `1,20,000). iii) Disbursement of the loan amount not to exceed `60,000 (enhanced from `35,000) in the first cycle and `1,00,000 (enhanced from `50,000) in subsequent cycles. Detailed guidelines will be issued shortly. 35. Several measures have been taken to ensure the timely flow of funds to the infrastructure sector. One of them was to create a separate category of non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) called NBFC-infrastructure debt fund (NBFC-IDF). These NBFCs were allowed only to provide take-out finance for infrastructure projects in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) segment under a tripartite agreement involving, among others, the project authority. Certain regulatory dispensations were also given to these NBFCs. With a view to expanding the nature of projects to which they can lend, it is proposed to allow NBFC-IDFs to provide take-out finance for infrastructure projects that have completed one year of operation in the PPP segment without a tripartite agreement and to the non-PPP segment, subject to certain conditions. Detailed guidelines are being issued separately. 36. Looking ahead, the Reserve Bank\u2019s developmental and regulatory policies will continue to be guided by the five-pillar approach to improve the efficacy of monetary and liquidity management, expand financial inclusion and carry forward banking sector reforms by adapting the best international practices to country-specific requirements. 37. The second bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on June 2, 2015; the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement on August 4, 2015; the fourth bi- monthly monetary policy statement on September 29, 2015; the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement on December 1, 2015; and the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement on February 2, 2016. ", "file7": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 7.5 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); and continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.5 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 8.5 per cent. 2. Since 2014-15\u2019s sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement of February, a moderate and uneven global recovery is emerging, with economies being buffeted (or supported) by currency fluctuations and commodity prices. Growth in the United States is likely to have been weak in the first quarter of calendar 2015, partly because of US dollar appreciation, but is expected to strengthen. The Euro area has started to show modest improvement, supported by a boost to demand from lower crude prices and the depreciation of the euro as well as easing financial and credit conditions following the commencement of quantitative easing. With the waning of the impact of the consumption tax increase, growth turned positive in Japan in Q4 of 2014 and consumer confidence and exports picked up. However, retail sales and industrial production contracted, indicating that the outlook is still weak. Growth fragilities and macroeconomic continues imbalances. This will have regional and global ramifications, although the softness in international commodity prices is providing some offset for net importers while adversely impacting net exporters. Global growth is likely to firm up through 2015 and 2016, supported by stronger recovery in the advanced economies (AEs) and soft energy prices. Downside risks mainly emanate from the slowdown in China, geopolitical risks surrounding oil prices and the uneven effects of currency and commodity price movements. financial 3. Global financial markets have been boosted by expectations of normalisation of US monetary policy being pushed back into late 2015, monetary policy stances turning highly accommodative in other AEs, and several emerging market economies (EMEs) easing policy rates to address growth concerns. Long-term yields have declined to all-time lows on weak inflation expectations, compression of term premiums and the safe haven allure of US Treasuries. Ultra low interest rates and reduction in risk premia have raised most asset prices to record highs, and have pushed investors to riskier assets such as equity and lower rated debt instruments. Exchange rates have experienced large and volatile movements, with the US dollar strengthening against most currencies. Among EMEs, markets have tended to discriminate against those with relatively weaker fundamentals and/or oil exporters. Nevertheless, with high portfolio flows to EMEs, risks from sudden shifts in market sentiment have increased. 4. Domestic economic activity is likely to have strengthened in Q4. Second advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture suggest that the contraction in food grains production in 2014-15 may turn out to be less than earlier anticipated. However, the adverse impact of unseasonal rains and hailstorms in March is still unfolding. Initial estimates indicate that as much as 17 per cent of the sown area under the rabi crop may have been affected though the precise extent of the damage remains to be determined. The growth in allied activities is likely to remain strong as in the recent past, though it remains to be seen whether it will fully compensate the decline in food grains output. 5. The industrial sector, and in particular, manufacturing appears to be regaining momentum, with the growth of production in positive territory for three consecutive months till January. While basic goods production has been expanding steadily since November 2013, capital goods output has been relatively lumpy and volatile, and more positive readings are needed to be confident about a durable pick-up in investment demand. The persisting contraction in consumer durables production for over two years could be reflecting the underlying weakness in consumption demand as well as higher imports. 6. Mixed signals are coming from the service sector. While the national accounts statistics seem to suggest that consumption demand for services is robust relative to the demand for goods, and purchasing managers perceive activity expanding on new orders, various coincident indicators of services sector activity including railway and port traffic, domestic and international passenger traffic, international freight traffic, tourist arrivals, motorcycle and tractor sales as well as bank credit and deposit growth remain subdued. 7. Retail inflation measured by the year-on-year changes in the revised consumer price index (CPI) firmed up for the third successive month in February as favourable base effects dissipated, despite the price index remaining virtually flat since December. The still elevated levels of prices of protein-rich items such as pulses, meat, fish and milk kept food inflation from following the seasonal decline in prices of vegetables and fruits. The prices of items such as sugar and edible oil moderated in consonance with the downturn in global commodity prices. Fuel inflation edged up for the second month in a row due to the increase in prices of electricity and firewood. 8. Inflation excluding food and fuel fell successively in the nine months till February. A large part of this disinflation has been on account of the slump in international crude oil prices feeding through into domestic prices of petrol and diesel that are included under the category transport and communication. Inflation in respect of housing has also eased in part reflecting in improvements. Furthermore, upside pressures methodological and coverage affecting prices of services such as education, health and other services have also fallen on account of weak demand conditions. The rate of growth of rural wages has come off substantially from the double digit levels that prevailed up to November 2013. Firms are also reporting a substantial easing of input price pressures, barring the most recent purchasing manager surveys. Reflecting past disinflation, inflation expectations of households are in single digits, although they too exhibit some firming up in Q4 in response to the turning up of food and fuel inflation during January- February. the revised CPI, 9. Since the shift in the monetary policy stance in January towards accommodation, the Reserve Bank has moved to ensure comfortable liquidity conditions through pro-active liquidity management, including fine-tuning operations on week days and access to the MSF and fixed rate reverse repo on Saturdays. This has helped to smooth the liquidity frictions that characterise events such as advance tax payments and balance sheet dates, keeping the money market rates anchored to the repo rate. In order to alleviate the pressures that build up in March on account of frictional factors, the Reserve Bank augmented its liquidity management instruments by engaging in repos of maturities ranging from 8 to 28 days cumulating to an outstanding amount of `1430 billion (including support from the MSF of `416 billion) at end-March in addition to regular 14-day term repo auctions and fixed rate overnight repos. The availability of liquidity can be gauged from the fact that in March, average daily liquidity returned by market participations through variable/fixed rate reverse repos amounted to `293 billion. 10. Export performance has been progressively weakening and contraction set in on both non-oil and petroleum product exports since December 2014. Fragile external demand conditions and the softness in international commodity prices have taken a heavy toll, as in several other EMEs in Asia. In particular, price realisations have been eroded, despite export volumes going up. With the Indian rupee gaining in real effective terms, export margins are coming under pressure for those exporters without substantial imported inputs. Net terms of trade gains and compression in imports of petroleum products have narrowed the trade deficit in the last three months to its lowest level since 2009-10. Gold imports remained contained; although non-oil non-gold imports grew at a modest pace in these months, they may be reflecting substitution effects in view of the sluggishness in domestic manufacturing. 11. Exports of services, particularly, software and travel have provided a silver lining and have helped to hold down the current account deficit (CAD) which has narrowed in Q3. This improvement has likely extended into Q4. As a result, capital inflows \u2013 mainly portfolio flows into domestic debt and equity markets and foreign direct investment \u2013 have exceeded the external financing requirement and enabled accretion to the foreign exchange reserves which reached an all-time peak of US$ 343 billion as on April 3, 2015. These reserves, including forward purchases that will be delivered over the next few months, provide some buffer against potential capital outflows when monetary policy normalisation in AEs commences. Good macroeconomic policy will, of course, be the critical first line of defence in retaining investor confidence. 12. In 2015 so far, the inflation path has evolved along the projected path after a sizable undershoot of the January 2015 target. CPI inflation is projected at its current levels in the first quarter of 2015-16, moderating thereafter to around 4 per cent by August but firming up to reach 5.8 per cent by the end of the year (Chart 1). There are upside risks to the central projection emanating from possible intensification of el ni\u00f1o conditions leading to a less than normal monsoon; large deviations in vegetable and fruit prices from their regular seasonal patterns, given unseasonal rains; larger than anticipated administered price revisions; faster closing of the output gap; geo- political developments leading to hardening of global commodity prices; and spillover from external developments through exchange rate and asset price channels. However, at this juncture, these upside risks appear to be offset by downsides originating from global deflationary/disinflationary tendencies, the still soft outlook on global commodity prices; and slack in the domestic economy. 13. Transmission of policy rates to lending rates has not taken place so far despite weak credit off take and the front loading of two rate cuts. With little transmission, and the possibility that incoming data will provide more clarity on the balance of risks on inflation, the Reserve Bank will maintain status quo in its monetary policy stance in this review. 14. The Monetary Policy Framework Agreement signed by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank in February 2015 will shape the stance of monetary policy in 2015-16 and succeeding years. The Reserve Bank will stay focussed on ensuring that the economy disinflates gradually and durably, with CPI inflation targeted at 6 per cent by January 2016 and at 4 per cent by the end of 2017-18. Although the target for end-2017-18 and thereafter is defined in terms of a tolerance band of +/- 2 per cent around the mid-point, it will be the Reserve Bank\u2019s endeavour to keep inflation at or close to this mid-point, with the extended period provided for achieving the mid-point mitigating potentially adverse effects on the economy. As outlined above, several favourable forces are at work, consistent with the change in the monetary policy stance towards accommodation effected from January. The Reserve Bank\u2019s intent is to allow the disinflationary momentum to spread through the economy, but remain vigilant about any resurgence of inflationary pressures that may destabilise the progress towards the inflation objectives set in the Agreement. 15. The outlook for growth is improving gradually. Comfortable liquidity conditions should enable banks to transmit the recent reductions in the policy rate into their lending rates, thereby improving financing conditions for the productive sectors of the economy. Along with initiatives announced in the Union Budget to boost investment in infrastructure and to improve the business environment, these factors should provide confidence to private investment and, together with the conducive outlook on inflation, deliver real income gains to consumers and lower input cost advantages to corporates. GDP growth estimates of the CSO for 2014-15 already project a robust pick-up, but leading and coincident indicators suggest a downward revision of these estimates when fuller information on real activity for the last quarter becomes available. Uncertainty surrounding the arrival and distribution of the monsoon and unanticipated global developments are the two major risks to baseline growth projections. Assuming a normal monsoon, continuation of the cyclical upturn in a supportive policy environment, and no major structural change or supply shocks, output growth for 2015-16 is projected at 7.8 per cent, higher by 30 bps from 7.5 per cent in 2014-15, but with a downward bias to reflect the still subdued indicators of economic activity (Chart 2). 16. Going forward, the accommodative stance of monetary policy will be maintained, but monetary policy actions will be conditioned by incoming data. First, the Reserve Bank will await the transmission by banks of its front-loaded rate reductions in January and February into their lending rates. Second, developments in sectoral prices, especially those of food, will be monitored, as will the effects of recent weather disturbances and the likely strength of the monsoon, as the Reserve Bank stays vigilant to any threats to the disinflation that is underway. The Reserve Bank will look through both seasonal as well as base effects. Third, the Reserve Bank will look to a continuation and even acceleration of policy efforts to unclog the supply response so as to make available key inputs such as power and land. Further progress on repurposing of public spending from poorly targeted subsidies towards public investment and on reducing the pipeline of stalled investment will also be helpful for monetary accommodation. Finally, the Reserve Bank will watch for signs of normalisation of the US monetary policy, though it anticipates India is better buffered against likely volatility than in the past. in containing supply constraints and creating 17. This part of the Statement reviews the progress on various developmental and regulatory policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank in recent policy statements and also sets out new measures to be taken for strengthening the banking structure; broadening and deepening financial markets and extending the reach of financial services to all. I. Monetary Policy Framework 18. Steps taken to revise the monetary policy framework are documented in the accompanying Monetary Policy Report. 19. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the final rules on the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) in October 2014. The Reserve Bank has already started phasing in implementation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from January 2015 and is committed to the scheduled implementation of NSFR from January 1, 2018 for banks in India. The Reserve Bank proposes to issue draft guidelines on NSFR by May 15, 2015. 20. Guidelines on Countercyclical Capital Buffers (CCCB) were issued on February 5, 2015. They advised that the CCCB would be activated as and when circumstances warrant, and that the decision would normally be pre-announced with a lead time of four quarters. The framework envisages the credit-to-GDP gap as the main indicator which may be used in conjunction with other supplementary indicators such as the incremental credit-deposit (C-D) ratio for a moving period of three years, the industrial outlook survey (IOS) assessment index and the interest coverage ratio. A review and empirical testing of these indicators was carried out to assess whether activation of the CCCB is warranted. It was concluded that the overall situation does not warrant imposition of CCCB at this point of time. 21. In July 2014, banks were allowed to issue long term bonds (LTBs), with exemptions from certain regulatory pre-emptions, for lending to (i) long-term projects in infrastructure sub-sectors, and (ii) affordable housing. However, cross-holding of such bonds amongst banks is currently not permitted. On a review, it has been decided to allow banks to invest in such bonds issued by other banks, subject to the following conditions: i) banks\u2019 investment in these bonds will not be treated as \u2018assets with the ii) any single bank\u2019s holding of bonds in a particular issue will be subject to certain limits in relation to the bond issue size. Its aggregate holding of such bonds will also be subject to certain limits in relation to its own assets. iii) LTBs held for trading will reduce the bank\u2019s priority sector and liquidity benefits obtained from its own issuance of LTBs. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued shortly. 22. For monetary transmission to occur, lending rates have to be sensitive to the policy rate. With the introduction of the Base Rate on July 1, 2010 banks could set their actual lending rates on loans and advances with reference to the Base Rate. At present, banks are following different methodologies in computing their Base Rate \u2013 on the basis of average cost of funds, marginal cost of funds or blended cost of funds (liabilities). Base Rates based on marginal cost of funds should be more sensitive to changes in the policy rates. In order to improve the efficiency of monetary policy transmission, the Reserve Bank will encourage banks to move in a time-bound manner to marginal-cost-of-funds-based determination of their Base Rate. Detailed guidelines will be issued shortly. 23. The Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd., jointly floated by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA), the Foreign Exchange Dealers' Association of India (FEDAI) and the Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA), has been established as an independent benchmark administrator. This administrator will start operations by end-May 2015. Once it starts publishing various indices of market interest rates, the Reserve Bank will explore the possibility of encouraging banks to use the indices as an external benchmark for pricing bank products. 24. The Reserve Bank has been prescribing a comprehensive \u2018Calendar of Reviews\u2019 to be deliberated by the boards of banks, with significant additions to the calendar over the years. Time spent on reviews reduces the leeway for the board to discuss issues of strategic importance for banks such as product market strategy and risk management. The Committee to Review Governance of Boards of Banks in India (Chairman: Dr. P.J.Nayak) recommended that discussions in the boards of banks need to be upgraded and greater focus should be on strategic issues. It is, therefore, proposed to do away with the mandatory calendar of reviews and instead, replace it with the seven critical themes prescribed by the Nayak Committee namely, business strategy, financial reports and their integrity, risk, compliance, customer protection, financial inclusion and human resources, and leave it to the banks\u2019 boards to determine other list of items to be deliberated and periodicity thereof. 25. The need to bring in professionalism to the boards of banks cannot be overemphasized. In order to attract and retain professional directors, it is essential that they are appropriately compensated. Public sector banks follow guidelines issued by the government in this regard. The remuneration of the part-time Chairmen of private sector banks are approved specifically for each bank under the current statutory provisions. However, there is no guidance on remuneration to other non- executive directors of private sector banks. Therefore, it is proposed: to issue guidelines to private sector banks on a policy on remuneration for the non-executive directors (other than part-time Chairman) that will reflect market realities and will be within the parameters specified in the Banking Regulation Act 1949 and the Companies Act, 2013; and ii) to discuss with the Government the adoption of a similar remuneration policy 26. With a view to enlarging the scope of urban co-operative banks for expanding their business, it has been decided to allow financially sound and well managed (FSWM) scheduled urban co-operative banks, which are CBS-enabled and having minimum net worth of `100 crore, to issue credit cards. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued separately. 27. Similarly, with a view to providing greater freedom to state co-operative banks to expand their business and to provide technology-enabled services to their customers, it has been decided to permit state co-operative banks satisfying certain eligibility criteria to set up off-site ATMs/mobile ATMs without obtaining prior approval from the Reserve Bank. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued separately. 28. Several steps have been taken by the Reserve Bank to promote liquidity in the government securities (G-sec) market as recommended by the Working Group on Enhancing Liquidity in the Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives Markets (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi). These include, inter alia, a) conduct of G-sec auctions at both uniform price and multiple price formats; b) change of the settlement cycle of primary auctions for treasury bills (T-bills) from T+2 to T+1 basis; and c) re- issuance of state development loans. 29. As part of continuing measures to promote liquidity, the Reserve Bank will formulate a scheme for market making by primary dealers in semi-liquid and illiquid government securities. Details of the scheme will be worked out and implemented in consultation with market participants within the next three months. 30. Although the G-sec market is predominantly institutional in nature, the Reserve Bank has initiated several steps to promote retail/individual investments, such as the non-competitive bidding scheme, and enabling access to the Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS-OM). To increase participation of the retail and mid- segment investors in the G-sec market, gilt account holders (GAHs) were also extended web-based access to NDS-OM (secondary market trading platform) and NDS-auction platform (primary market platform) earlier. Auctions of G-secs have since moved to a more robust CBS platform (e-Kuber). Accordingly, it is now proposed to introduce a similar web-based solution for participation of all mid-segment / retail investors having gilt accounts on the e-Kuber platform. The facility is expected to be made available within the next three months. through G-secs, retail tap private savings investors/individuals could be provided direct access to both primary and secondary market platforms without any intermediary. Hence, it is proposed to explore the creation of alternate channels of distribution (e-Distribution Channels) for G-secs by the Reserve Bank. iii) The Reserve Bank has been in consultation with all stakeholders to enable seamless movement of securities from subsidiary general ledger (SGL) form to demat form and vice versa to promote trading of G-secs on stock exchanges. Concomitantly, it has also been decided to provide demat account holders a functionality to put through trades on NDS-OM. As implementation of these reforms involves multiple agencies, it is proposed to constitute an from all stakeholders to roll out the measures within a period of six months. iv) The non-competitive bidding facility available to retail investors is currently applicable only to auctions of dated securities other than Treasury Bills. In the case of Treasury Bills, a different type of non-competitive bidding is permitted only for State governments, eligible provident funds, select foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds. It is proposed to allow non- competitive bidding facility in Treasury Bills to individuals as well. Details of the facility will be worked out and implemented in consultation with the Government of India. 31. A few international financial institutions were permitted to issue rupee bonds in overseas markets, subject to certain conditions. These issues have been received with interest. The appetite for rupee debt amongst international investors is a welcome development. In view of this, it is proposed to expand, in consultation with the Government of India, the scope of such bond issues by the international financial institutions as also to permit Indian corporates eligible to raise external commercial borrowing (ECB) through issuance of rupee bonds in overseas centers with an appropriate regulatory framework. 32. Under the present regulatory framework governing foreign exchange derivatives contracts under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA), writing of options by the users on a standalone basis is not permitted. However, end-users can enter into option strategies of simultaneous buying and selling of plain vanilla European options, provided there is no net receipt of premium. With a view to encouraging hedging of forex exposures and enhancing the liquidity of the currency options market, it is proposed to permit Indian exporters and importers to write covered options on the basis of actual contracted forex exposure, subject to conditions. Detailed operating instructions shall follow separately. 33. The Reserve Bank had constituted an Internal Working Group to revisit the Priority Sector guidelines. The Working Group has since submitted its report, which was placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website for comments/suggestions.The Working Group has, inter alia, recommended specific sub-targets for small and marginal farmers and micro enterprises and inclusion of certain specific types of social infrastructure within the ambit of priority sector lending. The working Group has also recommended introduction of tradable Priority Sector Lending Certificates as another instrument to manage deficit/surplus amongst the players within the system. The Reserve Bank will take a view on the recommendations in the light of feedback received and the guidelines in this regard will be issued shortly. 34. Taking into consideration the improvement in the Micro-Finance Institutions (MFI) sector and recommendations of the Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households (Chairman: Dr. Nachiket Mor), there is a need to revise upwards the limit relating to total indebtedness of the borrower, eligible rural and semi-urban household annual incomes and loan amounts to be disbursed in the first cycle and in subsequent cycles as follows: i) Total indebtedness of a borrower, excluding educational/ medical expenses, not to exceed `1,00,000 (raised from the current limit of `50,000). ii) Loan disbursed to a borrower with a rural household annual income not exceeding `1,00,000 (enhanced from `60,000) or urban and semi-urban household income not exceeding `1,60,000 (enhanced from `1,20,000). iii) Disbursement of the loan amount not to exceed `60,000 (enhanced from `35,000) in the first cycle and `1,00,000 (enhanced from `50,000) in subsequent cycles. Detailed guidelines will be issued shortly. 35. Several measures have been taken to ensure the timely flow of funds to the infrastructure sector. One of them was to create a separate category of non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) called NBFC-infrastructure debt fund (NBFC-IDF). These NBFCs were allowed only to provide take-out finance for infrastructure projects in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) segment under a tripartite agreement involving, among others, the project authority.

With a view to expanding the nature of projects to which they can lend, it is proposed to allow NBFC-IDFs to provide take-out finance for infrastructure projects that have completed one year of operation in the PPP segment without a tripartite agreement and to the non-PPP segment, subject to certain conditions. Detailed guidelines are being issued separately. 36. Looking ahead, the Reserve Bank\u2019s developmental and regulatory policies will continue to be guided by the five-pillar approach to improve the efficacy of monetary and liquidity management, expand financial inclusion and carry forward banking sector reforms by adapting the best international practices to country-specific requirements. 37. The second bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on June 2, 2015; the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement on August 4, 2015; the fourth bi- monthly monetary policy statement on September 29, 2015; the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement on December 1, 2015; and the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement on February 2, 2016. ", "file8": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 7.25 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 14-day term repos as well as longer term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.25 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 8.25 per cent Since our last statement, global economic activity has recovered modestly in 2. Q2 of calendar 2015. The US economy rebounded on stronger consumption growth and steadily improving labour market conditions, though recent wage data suggest continuing slack. The Euro area has grown at a moderate pace through the first half of 2015, supported by consumer spending, easing financing conditions and a modest downturn in still-high unemployment. In Japan, growth slowed in Q2 after an upside surprise in Q1. Domestic consumption is still weak, but manufacturing activity picked up in July and strengthening exports and corporate profitability could stimulate capital spending in H2. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), activity decelerated through H1 due to headwinds from weak external demand, tightening external financing conditions, deteriorating structural bottlenecks and spill overs from unsettled conditions in financial markets. Despite aggressive policy stimuli, the Chinese economy is slowing on macroeconomic rebalancing, sizable stock market corrections, a cooling property market and excess capacity in several manufacturing industries. Manufacturing activity weakened further in July, clouding near-term expectations. Recessionary conditions persist in both Russia and Brazil, with downside risks from commodity prices and geopolitical developments casting a shadow on the outlook, including for other EMEs. 3. In recent months, financial markets have experienced high turbulence due to the Greek crisis, the Chinese stock market slump and shifts between risk-on and risk- off sentiments based on changes in beliefs about when the Federal Reserve will start raising rates. Bond market sell-offs originating in Germany lifted bond yields across the world, including in EMEs, and tightened financing conditions. Equity markets were buoyed by the search for yields which stretched asset valuations until end-June, when sharp stock market corrections in China pulled down share prices globally. Currency markets were dominated by the rising US dollar, which impacted foreign currency borrowing exposures, increased exchange rate volatility and also produced sizable capital outflows from EMEs. Investors have reduced exposures to EMEs as an asset class, but a generalised flight to safety is yet to be seen. Investors have also shunned commodities affected by the Chinese slowdown, including bullion. 4. In India, the economic recovery is still work in progress. After strong rainfall in June, July has been below par, but on net, the monsoon is near normal. Higher reservoir levels also auger well for the prospects of kharif output, particularly for areas that are dependent on irrigation. Consequently, kharif sowing has expanded significantly relative to a year ago, especially in respect of oilseeds, pulses, rice and coarse cereals. These developments, supported by contingency plans for vulnerable districts, provide cushion against adverse weather shocks. If prospects of a good harvest strengthen, currently weak rural demand will improve to provide an important boost to activity. Shrinking exports in some industries, in part a result of weak global demand and global overcapacity in those industries and in part a result of the significant depreciation of currencies of some major trading partners against the rupee, also contributed to weak aggregate demand. The Reserve Bank\u2019s survey- based indicators point to flat capacity utilisation and new orders, with corporate sales growth declining \u2013 although lower inflation explains some of the compression in top lines. Although overall business confidence is positive, the level of optimism was a shade lower in April-June than in the preceding quarter. Investment, as measured by new projects, is still weak, primarily because of still-low capacity utilization. In the critically important power sector, where final demand is strong, the recent step-up in generation in response to the commendable easing of bottlenecks in coal supply is being partly negated by structural problems relating to clogging of transmission grids and the dire financial state of electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs). However, there are signs that consumption demand, especially in urban areas, 5. is picking up. Car sales for July were strong. Nominal bank credit growth is lower than previous years, but adjusted for lower inflation as well as for lower borrowing by oil marketing companies and increased borrowing from commercial paper markets, credit availability seems to be adequate for most sectors. 6. The services sector continues to emit mixed signals. The pick-up in heavy commercial vehicle sales and rising port and domestic air freight in Q1 suggest strengthening transportation activity (for Indian data, Q refers to fiscal year quarters). Purchasing managers\u2019 indices were in contraction zone in June, mainly due to lower new and existing business conditions. Survey-based expectations of the outlook for the services sector point to positive sentiment in Q2 on the back of an expected increase in turnover and profit margin. 7. Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation rose for the second successive month in June 2015 to a nine-month high on the back of a broad based increase in upside pressures, belying consensus expectations. The sharp month-on-month increase in food and non-food items overwhelmed the sizable \u2018base effect\u2019 in that month. Food inflation rose 60 basis points over the preceding month, driven by a spike in prices of vegetables, protein items - especially pulses, meat and milk - and spices. 8. Furthermore, excluding food and fuel, inflation rose in respect of all sub- groups other than housing. The momentum of price increases remained high for education. Inflation pressures increased for personal care and effects and household goods and services sub-groups. Inflation in CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel has been rising steadily since April and exceeded headline inflation through Q1. Near-term inflation expectations of households returned to double digits after two quarters, although those of professional forecasters remained anchored. Rural wage growth was moderate but there are indications of incipient pressures from corporate staff costs. 9. Liquidity conditions have been very easy in June and July. A seasonal reduction in demand for currency and increased spending by Government coupled with structural factors such as low credit deployment relative to the volume of deposit mobilisation contributed to surplus conditions in the money markets. This resulted in a significantly lower average daily net liquidity injection under the fixed rate repos under LAF, and variable rate term repo/reverse repo and MSF at 477 billion in June, down from 120 billion through these facilities. In response to the reduction in the policy repo rate in June the weighted average call rate eased from 7.47 per cent in May to 7.11 per cent in June. The Reserve Bank also conducted open market sales worth 83 billion in the second week of July, essentially in response to lack of demand for longer duration reverse repos. The call money rate remained below the repo rate through July, reflecting comfortable liquidity conditions. 1031 billion in May. In July there was net absorption of 10. Headwinds from weak global demand conditions restrained merchandise exports. The contraction in exports in Q1 of 2015-16, both volume and value, was the steepest since Q2 of 2009-10. The sharp fall in international commodity prices - especially crude oil - compressed import payments, helping to narrow the trade deficit. Domestic production shortages and lower international prices were, however, evident in higher imports of electronic goods, pulses, iron ore and fertilisers. Net surpluses on account of trade in services were sustained in Q1 and have, along with the lower trade deficit, helped reduce the current account deficit (CAD). Despite slowing portfolio flows, other forms of foreign capital flows such as foreign direct investment and non-resident deposits were sustained. With the shrinking external financing requirement, reserves were built up to an all-time high at the end of June, providing a buffer against adverse global shocks. Policy Stance and Rationale The bi-monthly policy statements of April and June indicated that the 11. accommodative stance of monetary policy will be maintained going forward, but monetary policy actions will be conditioned by (a) fuller transmission by banks of the Reserve Bank\u2019s (b) developments in food prices and their management, especially the effects of the monsoon, while looking through both seasonal as well as base effects; (c) a continuation and even acceleration of policy efforts to unclog the supply side so as to make available key inputs such as power and land, as also repurposing of public spending from poorly targeted subsidies towards public investment and reducing the pipeline of stalled investment; and (d) signs of normalisation of the US monetary policy. In the June statement, it was pointed out that a targeted infusion of bank capital is also warranted so that adequate credit flows to the productive sectors as investment picks up. 12. Since the first rate cut in January, the median base lending rates of banks has fallen by around 30 basis points, a fraction of the 75 basis points in rate cut so far. As loan demand picks up in Q3 of 2015-16, banks will see more gains from cutting rates to secure new lending, and more transmission will take place. The welcome announcement by Government of infusion of bank capital into public sector banks will help loan growth and hence transmission, as will currently easy liquidity conditions. 13. During 2015-16 so far, inflation conditions have evolved around the path projected in April and June bi-monthly policy statements, though they surprised somewhat on the upside in June. Large base effects, which the Reserve Bank will look through, are expected to pull down headline inflation in July and August. From September, favourable base effects wane. 14. Turning to the balance of inflation risks, most worrisome is the sustained hardening of inflation excluding food and fuel. Moreover, the full effects of the service tax increase, which took effect from June, will feed through over the rest of the year. Some food prices, particularly of protein-rich items, pulses and oilseeds have risen sharply in recent months. They will have to be carefully monitored as they tend to be sticky and impart an upward bias to inflation and inflation expectations. This assumes significance in view of households\u2019 inflation expectations rising again. Several factors, however, could have a significant mitigating influence. These include the sharp fall in crude prices since June and the likelihood of this softness persisting in view of the global supply glut and expanding production by Iran; the welcome increase in planting of pulses and oilseeds and prospects of rainfall in August and September according to some forecasters; the effects of the Government\u2019s current pro-active supply management to contain shocks to food prices, especially of vegetables, alongside its decision to keep increases in minimum support prices moderate. 15. Relative to the projections of the second bi-monthly statement, inflation projections in this bi-monthly statement are elevated by the higher than expected June observation but reduced by prospects of softer crude prices and a near-normal monsoon thus far. This implies that inflation projections for January-March 2016 are lower by about 0.2 per cent, with risks broadly balanced around the target of 6.0 per cent for January 2016 (Chart 1). 16. Taking into account all this, and given that policy action was front-loaded in June, it is prudent to keep the policy rate unchanged at the current juncture while maintaining the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Short term real risk free rates are nevertheless supportive of borrowing by interest rate sensitive consumer segments such as housing and automobiles. Significant uncertainty will be resolved in the coming months, including the likely persistence of recent inflationary pressures, the full monsoon outturn, as well as possible Federal Reserve actions. As the Reserve Bank awaits greater transmission of its front-loaded past actions, it will monitor developments for emerging room for more accommodation. 17. The outlook for growth is improving gradually. Favourable real income effects could accrue from weaker commodity prices, in particular crude oil, and a possible step-up in agricultural activity if monsoon conditions continue to improve. On the other hand, global growth projections for 2015 have generally been revised downwards and, therefore, the export contraction could become a prolonged drag on growth going forward. Notwithstanding some improvement in the state of stalled projects, supply constraints continue to be binding and new investment demand emanating from the private sector and the central Government remains subdued. On an assessment of the evolving balance of risks, the projected output growth for 2015- 16 has been retained at 7.6 per cent (Chart 2). 18. September 29, 2015. The fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on ", "file9": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to:  reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 50 basis points from 7.25 per cent to 6.75 per cent with immediate effect; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 14-day term repos as well as longer term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 7.75 per cent. 2. Since the third bi-monthly statement of August 2015, global growth has moderated, especially in emerging market economies (EMEs), global trade has deteriorated further and downside risks to growth have increased. In the United States, industrial production slowed as capital spending in the energy sector was cut back and exports contracted, weighed down by the strength of the US dollar. Consumer spending stayed buoyant, however, amidst steadily improving labour market conditions. In the Euro area, a fragile recovery strengthened, supported by domestic consumption, less slack in the labour market and improving financial conditions engendered by ultra-accommodative monetary policy. Economic activity in Japan, however, is faltering under the weight of weak private consumption and exports, with both business and consumer confidence subdued. EMEs are caught in a vortex of slowing global trade volumes, depressed commodity prices, weakening currencies and capital outflows, which is accentuating country-specific domestic constraints. China\u2019s intended rebalancing from investment towards consumption is being hit by the stock market meltdown, slower industrial production and weaker exports. The devaluation of the renminbi on August 11, while mild, has unsettled financial markets across the world. Brazil and Russia are grappling with recession and runaway inflation, while South Africa is facing tightening structural constraints which threaten to tip it into a downturn. 3. Since the Chinese devaluation, equity prices, commodities and currencies have fallen sharply. Capital flight from EMEs into mature bond markets has pushed down developed market yields, and risk spreads across asset classes have widened. Although volatility ebbed in early September and capital flows returned cautiously to some EMEs, sentiment in financial markets remains fragile. The September 17 decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to stay on hold in response to global conditions and weak domestic inflation lifted financial markets briefly, but overall financial conditions are yet to stabilise. In India, a tentative economic recovery is underway, but is still far from robust. 4. In agriculture, sown area has expanded modestly from a year ago, reflecting the timely and robust onset of the monsoon in June, but the southwest monsoon is currently deficient by 14 per cent \u2013 with production-weighted rainfall deficiency at 20 per cent. Nevertheless, the first advance estimates indicate that food grain production is expected to be higher than last year, reflecting actions taken to contain the adverse effects of rain deficiency through timely advisories and regular monitoring of seed and fertiliser availability. Allied farm activities, which are more insulated from the monsoon, remain resilient and could partly offset the effects of adverse weather on crop production. Rural demand, however, remains subdued as reflected in still shrinking tractor and two-wheeler sales. 5. Manufacturing has exhibited uneven growth in April-July, with industrial activity slowing sequentially in July, although it has been in expansionary mode for the ninth month in succession. Industries such as apparel, furniture and motor vehicles have experienced acceleration. Furthermore, the resumption of growth in production of consumer durables in recent months, after a protracted period of contraction over the last two years, is indicative of some pick-up in consumption demand, primarily in urban areas. Since our last review, however, external demand conditions have turned weaker, suggesting a more persistent drag from lower exports and cheaper imports due to global overcapacity. This contributes to continuing domestic capacity under- utilisation, decelerating new orders and a rising ratio of finished goods inventories to sales. 6. As a result of still tepid aggregate demand, output price growth is weak, but input material costs have fallen further, leading to an increase in margins for most producers. Weak aggregate demand appears to have more than offset the effect of higher margins to hold back new investment intentions. The expansion in capital goods production, therefore, likely relates more to the revival of stalled projects than to a build-up of the green field pipeline. Survey-based business sentiment has been falling in recent quarters. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) nevertheless remained in expansion territory in August, although it slowed from July due to weak domestic and export order books. 7. In the services sector, construction activity is weakening as reflected in low demand for cement and the large inventory of unsold residential houses in some localities. Rising public expenditure on roads, ports and eventually railways could, however, provide some boost to construction going forward. Lead indicators relating to freight and passenger traffic are mixed. In August, the services PMI remained in expansion for the second consecutive month on improving new business, but business expectations remain subdued. 8. Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation reached its lowest level in August since November 2014. The ebbing of inflation in the year so far is due to a combination of low month-on-month increases in prices and favourable base effects. Overall year-on-year food inflation dropped sharply, led by vegetables and sugar. Cereal inflation moderated steadily during April-August, but price pressures in respect of pulses and onions remained elevated. 9. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel eased in August for the second consecutive month, primarily due to the decline in petrol and diesel prices pulling down inflation in transportation. Fares other than for air transport have, however, remained inflexible downwards. Inflation in house rentals increased, but was more than offset by some moderation in the heterogeneous category of services, including education, personal care and effects, and health. Inflation expectations of households remained elevated in double digits likely in response to recent month-on-month increases in the prices of vegetables and pulses. Professional forecasters\u2019 inflation expectations eased as credibility built around the January 2016 inflation target. Rural wage growth remains subdued and corporate staff costs decelerated. 10. Liquidity conditions eased considerably during August to mid-September. In addition to structural factors such as deposit mobilisation in excess of credit flow, lower currency demand and pick-up in spending by the government contributed to the surplus liquidity. In response, the Reserve Bank conducted variable rate reverse repos of overnight and longer tenors ranging from 2 to 20 days. As a result, the average net daily liquidity absorption by the Reserve Bank increased from `120 billion in July to `261 billion in August and further to `544 billion in September (up to September 15). Money market rates generally remained below the repo rate. As quarterly tax collections went out of the system from mid-September, deficit conditions returned and the Reserve Bank engaged in average net injections of the order of `544 billion (September 16 to 27), keeping the call money rate close to the repo rate. Some forms of bank credit such as personal loans grew strongly as did non-bank financing flows through commercial paper, public equity issues and housing finance. 11. With the weakening of growth prospects in EMEs and world trade volume growth falling below world GDP growth, India\u2019s merchandise exports continued to decline in the first two months of Q2. Imports values also declined, but the sharp fall in international crude oil and gold prices was offset by rising import volumes. Non-oil non-gold imports went back into contraction after recording a marginal pick-up in the previous quarter, although there were higher imports of fertilisers, electronics and pulses. With services exports moderating, the widening of the merchandise trade deficit could lead to a modest increase in the current account deficit (CAD) during Q2. Net capital inflows were buoyed by sustained foreign direct investment and accretion to non-resident deposits, and reduced by portfolio outflows, mainly from equity markets. Foreign exchange reserves rose by US $ 10.4 billion during the first half of 2015-16. 12. In the bi-monthly policy statement of August, the Reserve Bank indicated that further monetary policy accommodation will be conditioned by the abating of recent inflationary pressures, the full monsoon outturn, possible Federal Reserve actions and greater transmission of its front-loaded past actions. Since then, inflation has dropped to a nine-month low, as projected. Despite the monsoon deficiency and its uneven spatial and temporal distribution, food inflation pressures have been contained by resolute actions by the government to manage supply. The disinflation has been broad-based and inflation excluding food and fuel has also come off its recent peak in June. The Federal Reserve has postponed policy normalisation. Markets have transmitted the Reserve Bank\u2019s past policy actions via commercial paper and corporate bonds, but banks have done so only to a limited extent. The median base lending rates of banks have fallen by only about 30 basis points despite extremely easy liquidity conditions. This is a fraction of the 75 basis points of the policy rate reduction during January-June, even after a passage of eight months since the first rate action by the Reserve Bank. Bank deposit rates have, however, been reduced significantly, suggesting that further transmission is possible. Looking forward, inflation is likely to go up from September for a few months 13. as favourable base effects reverse. The outlook for food inflation could improve if the increase in sown area translates into higher production. Moderate increases in minimum support prices should keep cereal inflation muted, while subdued international food price inflation should continue to put downward pressure on the prices of sugar and edible oil, and food inflation more generally. It is important that pro-active supply-side management by the government be in place to head off any food price pressures should they materialise, especially in respect of onion and pulses. The pass-through of the recent depreciation of the rupee will have to be carefully monitored, although benign crude prices should have an offsetting effect. Taking all this into consideration, inflation is expected to reach 5.8 per cent in January 2016, a shade lower than the August projection (Chart 1). The modest pick-up in the growth momentum in the first half of 2015-16 14. benefited from soft commodity prices, disinflation, comfortable liquidity conditions, some de-clogging of stalled projects, and higher capital expenditure by the central government. Underlying economic activity, however, remains weak on account of the sustained decline than expected momentum in industrial production and investment activity. With global growth and trade slower than initial expectations, a continuing lack of appetite for new investment in the private sector, the constraint imposed by stressed assets on bank lending and waning business confidence, output growth projected for 2015-16 is marked down slightly to 7.4 per cent from 7.6 per cent earlier (Chart 2). Concurrent indicators also suggest that the new GDP series shows higher growth than would the old series, which necessitates recalibrating old measures of potential output and the output gap to the new series. 15. Since our last review, the bulk of our conditions for further accommodation have been met. The January 2016 target of 6 per cent inflation is likely to be achieved. In the monetary policy statement of April 2015, the Reserve Bank said that it would strive to reach the mid-point of the inflation band by the end of fiscal 2017- 18. Therefore, the focus should now shift to bringing inflation to around 5 per cent by the end of fiscal 2016-17. In this context, the weakening of global activity since our last review suggests that commodity prices will remain contained for a while. Still-low industrial capacity utilisation indicates more domestic demand is needed to substitute for weakening global demand in order that the domestic investment cycle picks up. The coming Pay Commission Report could add substantial fiscal stimulus to domestic demand, but the government has reaffirmed its desire to respect its fiscal targets and improve the quality of its spending. Under these circumstances, monetary policy has to be accommodative to the extent possible, given its inflation goals, while recognizing that continuing policy implementation, structural reforms and corporate actions leading to higher productivity will be the primary impetus for sustainable growth. Furthermore, investment is likely to respond more strongly if there is more certainty about the extent of monetary stimulus in the pipeline, even if transmission is slow. Therefore, the Reserve Bank has front-loaded policy action by a reduction in the policy rate by 50 basis points. Given our year-ahead projections of inflation, this ensures one year expected Treasury bill real interest rates of about 1.5-2.0 per cent, which are appropriate for this stage of the recovery. 16. While the Reserve Bank\u2019s stance will continue to be accommodative, the focus of monetary action for the near term will shift to working with the Government to ensure that impediments to banks passing on the bulk of the cumulative 125 basis points cut in the policy rate are removed. The Reserve Bank will continue to be vigilant for signs that monetary policy adjustments are needed to keep the economy on the target disinflationary path. 17. December 1, 2015. The fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on 18. This part of the Statement reviews the Reserve Bank\u2019s measures to strengthen the monetary policy framework, make banking structure and practices more efficient, broaden and deepen financial markets, deal with stress in corporate and financial assets, and extend the reach of financial services to all. I. Monetary Policy Framework 19. Discussions on monetary policy and its institutional and operating framework are set out in Part A of this Statement and the Monetary Policy Report issued along with this Statement. 20. The Reserve Bank has put out for comment draft guidelines for banks on the computation of base rate, based on their marginal cost of funds. Guidelines will be issued by end-November 2015. 21. In March 2015, the Reserve Bank issued a Discussion Paper titled \u201cLarge Exposures Framework and Enhancing Credit Supply through Market Mechanism\u201d for stakeholders\u2019 comments. The Discussion Paper focused on the need to encourage alternative sources of funding to bank credit for the corporate sector to finance growth. This would also de-risk the balance sheets of banks. Specifically, the paper proposed ways to encourage large corporates with borrowings from the banking system above a cut-off level to tap the market for their working capital and term loan needs. Based on suggestions received from stakeholders, the Reserve Bank will issue a draft circular by end-December 2015. 22. As a part of its supervisory process, the Reserve Bank assesses compliance by banks with extant prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning (IRACP). There have been divergences between banks and the supervisor as regards asset classification and provisioning. In order to bring in greater transparency, better discipline with respect to compliance with IRACP norms as well as to involve other stakeholders, the Reserve Bank will mandate disclosures in the notes to accounts to the financial statements of banks where such divergences exceed a specified threshold. Instructions in this regard are being issued separately. 23. The Union Budget for 2014-15 emphasised the urgent need for convergence of the current Indian accounting standards (IND AS) with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Reserve Bank has recommended to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs a roadmap for the implementation of IND AS by banks and non- banking financial companies from 2018-19 onwards. The Reserve Bank constituted a Working Group (Chairman: Shri Sudarshan Sen) for its implementation. The Report of the Working Group will be placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website by end-October 2015 for public comments. 24. At present, the minimum risk weight applicable on individual housing loans is 50 per cent. With a view to improving \u201caffordability of low cost housing\u201d for economically weaker sections and low income groups and giving a fillip to \u201cHousing for All\u201d, while being cognisant of prudential concerns, it is proposed to reduce the risk weights applicable to lower value but well collateralised individual housing loans. Detailed guidelines are being issued separately. 25. Banks are permitted to hold investments under the HTM category in excess of the limit of 25 per cent of their total investments, provided the excess comprises only SLR securities and the total SLR securities held under the HTM category are not more than 22 per cent of NDTL. The SLR has been reduced to 21.50 per cent of NDTL with effect from February 7, 2015. To align them, it has been decided to bring down the ceiling on SLR securities under HTM from 22 per cent to 21.50 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning January 9, 2016. Thereafter, both the SLR and the HTM ceiling will be brought down by 0.25 per cent every quarter till March 31, 2017. 26. The Depositor Education and Awareness Fund Scheme, 2014 has been established by transfer of bank deposits and other credit balances that have remained unclaimed for more than 10 years. It envisages grant of financial assistance to applicants selected on the basis of proposals intended to promote depositors\u2019 interests. In response to the press release issued on January 9, 2015, the Reserve Bank received 90 applications for financial assistance. The names of successful applicants will be announced by October 1, 2015. The window for inviting applications for availing financial assistance from the fund shall be re-opened. 27. The report of the High Powered Committee (HPC) on UCBs (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi) to examine and recommend permissible business lines, appropriate size, conversion of UCBs into commercial banks and licensing of new UCBs was placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website on August 20, 2015 for comments and suggestions. Based on the feedback received, the recommendations of the Committee will be considered for implementation during the second half of 2015-16. 28. Cyber security has assumed critical importance across the globe. With the widespread use of new technologies, inter-connectedness and dependency, newer risks, threats and vulnerabilities have emerged. The Reserve Bank is setting up an information technology (IT) subsidiary to assist in monitoring the preparedness of banks and identifying systemic vulnerabilities along with aiding the Reserve Bank in its own cyber initiatives. 29. The Reserve Bank will update all its master regulations, and streamline the required procedure for compliance with the regulations by January 1, 2016. All master regulations will be fully updated and placed online. The Reserve Bank will also work to improve clarity in regulatory communications. III. Financial Markets 30. With the objective of having a more predictable regime for investment by the foreign portfolio investors (FPI), the medium term framework (MTF) for FPI limits in debt securities, worked out in consultation with the government, is set out below. (i) The limits for FPI investment in debt securities will henceforth be announced/ fixed in rupee terms. (ii) The limits for FPI investment in the central government securities will be increased in phases to 5 per cent of the outstanding stock by March 2018. In aggregate terms, this is expected to open up room for additional investment of `1,200 billion in the limit for central government securities by March 2018 over and above the existing limit of `1,535 billion for all government securities (G-sec). (iii) Additionally, there will be a separate limit for investment by FPIs in the State Development Loans (SDLs), to be increased in phases to reach 2 per cent of the outstanding stock by March 2018. This would amount to an additional limit of about `500 billion by March 2018. (iv) The increase in limits will be announced every half year in March and September and released every quarter. (v) The existing requirement of investments being made in G-sec (including SDLs) with a minimum residual maturity of three years will continue to apply. (vi) Limits for the residual period of the current financial year would be increased in two tranches from October 12, 2015 and January 1, 2016. Each tranche would entail an increase in limits as under: `130 billion for central government securities composed of `75 billion for long term investors and `55 billion for others `35 billion for SDL open to all FPI investors. A circular with details of the MTF is being issued separately. 31. In the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2015-16, announced on April 07, 2015, it was proposed to permit Indian corporates that are eligible to raise external commercial borrowings (ECB) to issue rupee bonds in overseas centres with an appropriate regulatory framework. Based on the comments received on the draft framework and in consultation with the Government, it has been decided to permit Indian corporates to issue rupee denominated bonds with a minimum maturity of five years at overseas locations within the ceiling of foreign investment permitted in corporate debt (US$ 51 billion at present). There shall be no restriction on the end use of funds except a small negative list. Detailed instructions are being issued separately. 32. The Reserve Bank has placed the draft framework on ECB on its website on September 23, 2015 for comments/ feedback. The revised framework suiting the current economic and business environment will replace the extant ECB policy. 33. Scheduled commercial banks and primary dealers (PDs) are currently permitted to execute the sale leg of short sale transactions in the over the counter (OTC) market in addition to the Negotiated Dealing System\u2013Order Matching (NDS- OM) platform. Short sale in the OTC market is, however, not permitted between the primary member (PM) and its gilt account holder (GAH). The Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CClL) has introduced a facility in the reported segment of NDS-OM which captures details of transactions involving gilt accounts. Accordingly, it is proposed to permit short sale by a PM to its GAH and also to treat purchase by a PM from its GAH as a cover transaction. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by end-October 2015. 34. There has been significant improvement in market infrastructure in the inter- bank repo market in G-sec. This enables Reserve Bank to review restrictions placed on repo transactions, particularly relating to the participation of gilt account holders in the repo market, guided by the recommendations of the Working Group on Enhancing Liquidity in the Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives Markets (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi). New guidelines in this regard will be issued by end- November 2015. 35. When Issued (WI) trading in G-sec was permitted in 2006 to facilitate the distribution process by stretching the actual distribution period for each issue and allowing the market more time to absorb large issues without disruption. In order to encourage trading in the WI market, it is proposed to: (i) permit the scheduled commercial banks to take short positions in the WI market for both new and reissued securities, subject to limits and other conditions in place from time to time; and (ii) (PDs) to take long positions in the WI market. permit regulated entities other than banks and primary dealers Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued by end-November 2015. 36. Guidelines on repo in corporate debt were issued in January 2010. In order to further develop the repo market, a broad framework for introduction of electronic dealing platform/s for repo in corporate bonds will be designed in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). 37. While the currency futures market has grown, participation in this segment has been restricted to a few categories of entities. In order to diversify the participation profile in the currency futures market, stand-alone PDs will be permitted to deal in currency futures contracts traded on the recognised exchanges, subject to adherence to certain risk control measures and without diluting their existing obligations in the G- sec market. Guidelines in this regard will be issued by end-November 2015. 38. At present, exchange traded currency derivatives include futures and options in four currency pairs viz., USD-INR, EUR-INR, GBP-INR and JPY-INR. With a view to enabling direct hedging of exposures in foreign currencies and to permit execution of cross-currency strategies by market participants, exchange traded currency futures and options will be introduced in three cross-currency pairs viz., EUR-USD, GBP- USD and USD-JPY. Necessary guidelines will be issued in consultation with SEBI by end-November 2015. 39. Establishing underlying exposure through verifiable documentary evidence has been a key regulatory requirement for accessing OTC forex markets. To provide more flexibility to market participants in managing their currency risk in the OTC market and for making hedging easier, it has been decided to increase the limit for resident entities for hedging their foreign exchange exposure in the OTC market from US$ 250,000 to US$ one million without the production of any underlying documents, subject to comprehensively review the documentation related requirements in the OTC market.

Going forward, inflation is projected to stay below the January 2016 target in 2015-16 and ease further in 2016- 17. The projection of growth is revised downward for 2015-16, with some firming in the following year. Potential volatility in global financial markets poses the most significant risk to these projections. Over (April-March), macroeconomic developments have evolved in close consonance with staff\u2019s baseline forecast paths set out in the April 2015 Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Deviations in levels, albeit small, are observed both above and below the projections, indicating the absence of systematic bias in forecast errors. Chapters II and III explain the factors underlying these deviations in inflation and growth developments, respectively. Significant shifts in global and domestic macro- economic and financial conditions since the April 2015 MPR warrant a re-assessment of the baseline assumptions determining the initial conditions that drive staff\u2019s projections, and revisions if any (Chart I.1). First, from the second quarter (Q2) of 2015-16, international crude oil prices have fallen substantially below the April 2015 MPR baseline assumption1. The lower level of oil prices assuaged domestic inflation pressures, supported domestic demand and helped to contain fiscal and current account deficits. Secondly, notwithstanding some bright spots \u2013 mainly the US and the Euro area \u2013 global growth has weakened below in expectations, and the deepening slowdown emerging and developing economies (EDEs) could warrant downward revisions in forecasts (Table I.1). Thirdly, high volatility seems to have become the new normal in global financial markets, with sharp risk-on- risk-off swings shifting external financial conditions across the emerging world. Prominent triggers are concerns about China - growth slowdown; stock market meltdown; devaluation - as well as the pace and timing of interest rate action by the US Federal Reserve. Fourthly, the growth in volume of world trade is hovering below the growth of the world GDP, vitiating the underlying price and income elasticities and weakening the contribution of exports to aggregate demand for a broad swathe of economies, advanced and emerging alike. With international trade prices contracting faster than trade volumes, the differential effects of terms of trade movements on net commodity exporters and importers have become somewhat blurred. Overall, global risks have heightened significantly. Domestically, the full impact of the 1 As against the baseline assumption of US$ 60 per barrel in the first half and US$ 63 per barrel in the second half of FY 2015-16, the Indian basket of crude oil averaged US$ 50 per barrel in Q2.

Staff\u2019s growth and inflation projections for eight quarters ahead in the MPR are generated out of three interacting and mutually reinforcing models: (a) a macro econometric model that simulates the working of the economy and estimates structural parameters; (b) a forecasting and policy analysis system (FPAS) that uses to generate alternative paths of the policy interest rate under various shocks comprising the balance of risks (Box I.1), using two quarters ahead projection of key information variables obtained from projection system that employs competing models (structural analysis; multivariate regression analysis; forward looking surveys and lead indicators) aggregated parsimoniously through root mean squared error (RMSE) scores. evidence of a significant element of backward- lookingness in households\u2019 inflation expectations with high sensitivity and adaption to recent movements in a few salient prices such as those of vegetables, fruits and petrol. Inflation expectations also reflect the memory of close to double digit inflation for six years (up to 2013-14). The September round of the survey indicates that inflation is expected to be 10.5 per cent in Q3 and 10.8 per cent one year ahead. Professional forecasters expect short-run inflation to pick up in the coming quarters, in consonance with Inflation expectations play a critical role in the formation of inflation through their impact on wage and price contracts. In the September 2015 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, urban households have reported a firming up of their inflation expectations, one quarter as well as one year ahead, for the third consecutive quarter (Chart I.2). Qualified by the caveat that the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey has yielded only 41 observations so far2, there is strengthening empirical 2 The Reserve Bank has been conducting a quarterly survey on inflation expectations of urban households since September 2005. The survey, conducted in 16 cities, covers 5000 households and elicits qualitative and quantitative responses on expected price changes and inflation for the next three months and the next one year. Central banks adopting flexible inflation targeting have favoured the development of a forward-looking monetary policy framework centred on inflation forecasts as intermediate targets. A forecasting and policy analysis system (FPAS) has found appeal in terms of generating consistent model-based forecasts of the economy and calibrating policy reactions. The core of the FPAS is a quarterly projection model (QPM), which is a forward-looking open economy calibrated general equilibrium gap model in the new Keynesian tradition (Berg et al, 2006). Satellite models augment QPM by providing sectoral dynamics. The QPM consists of four blocks: (a) an aggregate demand or IS function; (b) an inflation block capturing food, fuel, and core (excluding food and fuel) inflation dynamics, the last element taking the form of a hybrid New Keynesian Phillips curve; (c) the exchange rate block; and (d) a forward looking policy reaction function. two, minimising deviations of real economic activity from the level determined by the productive potential of the economy. Setting optimal policy requires the assignment of optimal weights to each, depending on the responsiveness of demand to the real interest rate and the sensitivity of inflation to marginal cost and supply shocks. The optimal policy response will vary according to the size of these weights and the speed with which the policy instrument (the interest rate) is adjusted. Estimates of an optimal monetary policy rule in a FPAS- type framework indicate that for India, the optimum weight on the inflation gap (actual minus target) ranges between 1.6 and 2.2, while the weight on the output gap (actual minus potential) varies between 0.8 and 1.4, with these weights increasing as the speed of adjustment of the policy repo rate rises (the interest rate smoothing parameter falls). In real life, both inflation and growth are subject to considerable volatility and this affects public welfare adversely by imposing uncertainty around decision-making. Optimal monetary policy is all about maximising the well-being of economic agents in the country. In its simplest form, it can be described in terms of two components: one, minimising the deviations of inflation from a certain optimal rate and Berg, A., P. Karam, and D. Laxton (2006), \u201cA Practical Model-based Approach to Monetary Policy Analysis: Overview\u201d. Working Paper No. WP/06/80, International Monetary Fund. staff\u2019s projections (Chart I.3). Importantly, their inflation expectations 10 years ahead moderated to 4.7 per cent in the September 2015 survey, approaching the Reserve Bank\u2019s medium-term target, and indicating a better anchoring of long-term inflation expectations. Purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMI) indicate softening of inflationary pressures to their weakest level since April with upside pressures from the services sector being more than offset by the downside pressures from the manufacturing sector. Manufacturers polled by the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expect increases in output prices to moderate, driven down by lower input prices as also weakening pricing power (Chart I.4). Inflationary pressures from rural wage growth have remained relatively muted on the back of a moderation in nominal wage growth and going forward, they are expected to remain contained. Headline CPI inflation is expected to firm up from its current trough and rise to around 4.5 per cent in September as favourable base effects reverse and average 5.5 per cent in Q3 and 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2015-16. Assuming that various determinants of inflation evolve in the manner posited by staff in this MPR, especially the evolution of global crude oil and domestic food price dynamics, CPI inflation is expected to average 5.5 per cent in 2016-17 and moderate to around 4.8 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17 (with a 70 per cent confidence interval of 2.6-7.0 per cent)(Chart I.5). The baseline outlook, however, is subject to considerable uncertainties surrounding commodity prices, monsoon and weather-related items and disturbances, volatility through spillovers from external developments exchange rate and asset price channels (Box I.2). A factor complicating forecasts of real gross value added (GVA) is the underlying behaviour of deflators Looking ahead, the macroeconomic environment appears subdued. While consumption demand seems to be holding up other than in rural areas, the outlook for investment demand remains lacklustre with a shrinking pipeline of greenfield projects, lack of forward movement on the brownfield pipeline, the pressure of considerable slack as evident in persisting under-utilisation of capacity and build-up of finished goods inventories, still high stress on banks\u2019 balance sheets and limited progress on major structural reforms. The prospects for exports too appear muted in view of the deterioration in the external trading environment. Moreover, the gains in terms of real incomes expected from favourable terms of trade for net commodity importers have been weak so far. Over the second half of 2015-16, the recovery in the agricultural sector observed in Q1 is unlikely to sustain, given the 14 per cent deficit in rainfall as well as its uneven distribution, and lower reservoir levels. The industrial sector continues to suffer from structural weakness in various core sectors: financial stress among distribution companies (DISCOMs) in the electricity sector, declining natural gas and crude Timely and accurate forecasts of growth and inflation play a critical role in the conduct and formulation of monetary policy. If the assumptions underlying these forecasts undergo drastic changes, actual outcomes may deviate substantially from the initial forecasts. A survey of 16 central banks indicates that 13 over- predicted inflation during 2014 by an average of about 150 basis points (bps)@ (Chart a), driven by large unexpected declines in crude oil and other commodity prices. An optimism in growth projections is also evident in 2014, with average over-prediction of around 30 bps# (Chart b). This optimism is also visible in the IMF\u2019s growth forecasts for 2011-14 which were, on average, 60 bps more than actual growth, with average forecast errors for EDEs being almost twice as large as those for AEs (IMF, 2014). In India, actual growth in 2014 was higher than projected, largely an outcome of the revised methodology under the new GDP series. Given the uncertainty in the evolution of baseline assumptions, therefore, many central banks encompass their point forecasts for inflation and growth within fan charts, which provide a probabilistic assessment of the likely outcomes for inflation and growth. oil production, coal production impacted by weak affecting domestic producers. Overall consumer confidence polled in the September 2015 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey ebbed with regard to prospects Business conditions assessed in the September 2015 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey were slanted to the downside. Business expectations, however, stabilised for the ensuing quarter, benefiting from an improvement in the financial situation (Chart I.7). Lack of external and, especially, domestic demand are seen by the surveyed firms as the biggest constraint. Surveys by other agencies conducted @ The sample covers major central banks which provide forecasts on a quarterly basis (either in text or where this information can be inferred from the fan charts). The inflation forecast for the quarter January-March 2015 (in case of US, October-December 2014) made in the month nearest to January 2014 is evaluated against actual inflation during the quarter January-March 2015. # This compares growth/output gap projections for the year 2014 (in the case of the US, Q4:2014) made in the month nearest to January 2014 with the actual outturn. during July-August 2015 also exhibit a moderation in business confidence (Table I.2). Professional forecasters surveyed during September 2015 expect output growth to pick up gradually and remain at 7.5 per cent or higher till the second quarter of the next financial year (Chart I.8 and Table I.3). indicators, the forward- Overall, looking surveys and estimates from model-based forecasts warrant a downward revision of GVA growth to 7.4 per cent in 2015-16 from the projection given in the April MPR. Growth in real GVA at basic prices is expected to be around 7.0 per cent in Q3 of 2015-16 before firming up to around 7.6 percent in Q4 with risks evenly balanced around this projection (Chart I.9). Real GVA growth is expected to pick up gradually in 2016-17 on a shallow cyclical upturn, driven by an expected normal monsoon and some improvement in external demand, but assuming no structural changes induced by policy measures and the absence of major supply shocks. The current environment of soft global commodity prices provides a potential upside bias to the growth projections. The baseline projections of growth and inflation set out in this chapter are subject to the evolution of a number of risks, both downside and upside. Plausible risk scenarios are developed below. The exchange rate of the rupee has experienced bouts of sharp volatility since June 2015, triggered by heightened uncertainty in global financial markets and pressures on the exchange rate on account of external developments. Potential herding behaviour of foreign investors remains a significant risk at the current juncture. Estimates from the QPM suggest that a 10 per cent depreciation of the rupee vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar relative to the baseline assumption of the current level of the exchange rate could lead to an GVA Growth Agriculture and Allied Activities Industry Services Gross Domestic Saving (per cent of GNDI) Gross Fixed Capital Formation (per cent of GDP) Money Supply (M3) Growth Bank Credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks Growth Combined Gross Fiscal Deficit (per cent of GDP) Central Government Gross Fiscal Deficit (per cent of GDP) Repo Rate (end period) CRR (end period) Yield of 91-Days Treasury Bills (end period) YTM of Central Govt. Securities with term to maturity of 10-years (end period) Overall Balance of Payments (US $ bn.) Merchandise Export Growth Merchandise Import Growth Merchandise Trade Balance (per cent of GDP) Current Account Balance (per cent of GDP) Financial Account Balance (per cent of GDP) increase of 20-30 bps in headline CPI inflation over two to four quarters, while boosting growth by around 10 bps (Charts I.10 and I.11). The favourable impact on exports and hence on growth can be expected to come into play in 2016-17, given the lags in the impact of exchange rate movements on export volumes. This positive impact could, however, get offset by the relatively quicker adverse impact of slowing external demand and competitive currency depreciations. Given the large weight of China in the global economy, an accentuation of the loss of speed in the Chinese economy can spill over to the rest of the world through trade, financial and confidence channels. Potential volatility in the international financial markets over the pace of the US monetary policy normalisation, like the 2013 tapering episode, can also pull down global economic activity more than currently anticipated. A one percentage point lower global growth is estimated to reduce India\u2019s growth by 20-40 bps below the baseline. On the other hand, such a scenario may also lead to a further fall in international commodity prices, which could lower domestic inflation by 10-20 bps. The south-west monsoon rainfall turning out to be deficient for the second year in succession has been factored into baseline projections. If food price pressures emanating from deficient monsoon remain contained on account of better supply management measures, headline inflation could turn out to be around 100 bps below the baseline in 2015-16. In view of the uneven rainfall, however, there is a risk that crop yields could be depressed more than envisaged. The resultant shortfall in crop production could reduce growth by around 30-40 bps, while putting upward pressure on food prices and inflation could turn out to be around 100 bps higher than the baseline in 2015-16. The sharp decline in international crude oil prices that has occurred over the course of the last one year highlights the high uncertainty around the baseline assumption. The deviation of oil prices in either direction would impact baseline growth and inflation scenarios. Weaker than expected global demand and/ or further augmentation of supply would keep oil prices below the baseline assumption, whereas any supply disruptions due to geo-political developments could lead to potential spikes in oil prices. If oil prices moderate to around US$ 40 per barrel during 2015- 16:H2, headline inflation could be lower by around 20-30 bps from the baseline by March 2016 and growth could be higher by about 10 bps. On the other hand, if supply disruptions push up oil prices to around US$ 70 per barrel, inflation could be higher by around 40 bps over the baseline by March 2016 and growth could be weaker by about 20 bps. (e) Boost to Investment The Centre\u2019s investment spending has seen a sharp increase in Q2 of 2015-16, consistent with the announcement in the Union Budget 2015-16. If this boost to public investment is sustained, and it crowds in private investment activity, real GVA growth could be 50 bps above the baseline in 2015-16. The impact on inflation, however, is likely to be muted in view of the still negative output gap. Overall, the benign outlook for global crude oil and other commodity prices, in conjunction with weak domestic demand conditions, is expected to help keep inflationary pressures manageable. The deficient and uneven rainfall, however, does pose the risk of pressures on food prices, although supply side policies so far have been effective in managing the price situation. Potential elevation of volatility and uncertainty in the global financial markets related to the Chinese growth transition and US monetary policy normalisation and its spillover to the Indian markets also pose significant risks to the baseline paths of growth and inflation set out in this chapter. Consumer price inflation has eased across the board in the first half of 2015-16. Input prices contracted, rural wage growth remained modest and corporate staff costs have undergone some deceleration. The MPR of April 2015 projected a steady disinflation through the first half of 2015-16. It anticipated a trough in August after which inflation was expected to turn up as favourable base effects dissipated. Inflation outcomes have closely matched this projected path directionally. Minor deviations in levels from the projected trajectory are attributable to three important developments. First, global commodity prices, especially of crude oil, hardened unexpectedly in Q1 before falling sharply in Q2. Secondly, food prices turned out to be more volatile than expected, with the rabi crop shortfall inducing spikes in prices of pulses and weather-related upsurge in prices of vegetables pushing up the momentum of headline inflation in May and June. Analogously, the rapid waning of these transient price pressures brought down month-on- month (m-o-m) inflation momentum in July faster than foreseen. Thirdly, the rupee depreciated in August; estimates suggest that typically, a 10 per cent nominal depreciation in the rupee leads to a 20-30 basis points (bps) increase in inflation over two to four quarters. CPI inflation eased across the board over the first five months of 2015-16 (Chart II.1a). The distribution of inflation across major sub-groups has moved leftward but symmetrically around the mean, implying that the ongoing disinflation is broad-based (Chart II.1b). Headline inflation moderated to 5.1 per cent in Q1, undershooting staff\u2019s projection in the April 2015 MPR by 20 basis points. The seasonal firming up of price pressures materialised in May, rather than from April as is typical. In June, however, there was an unanticipated surge in m-o-m inflation momentum. A breakdown of m-o-m price increases under goods (durable and non-durables) and services showed that the uptick in prices in May was largely driven by pulses (under non-durable 30 days recall1), followed by vegetables (under non-durable 7 days recall1) and other protein-based food items (under non-durable 7 days recall) in June (Chart II.2). In Q2 so far, headline inflation fell to 3.7 per cent in August \u2013 the lowest since November 2014 \u2013 on a combination of favourable base effects and lower order of m-o-m increases 1 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Under MMRP, data on expenditure incurred are collected for frequently purchased items \u2013 for edible oil, eggs, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, spices, beverages, processed foods, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, during the last seven days; for clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods, during the last 365 days; and for all other food, fuel and light, miscellaneous goods and services including non-institutional medical services, rents and taxes, during the last 30 days. (Chart II.3). In August, inflation eased below the projection by 30 basis points. Downward adjustment in pump prices of petrol and diesel as well as a generalised easing of inflation pressures across goods and services other than food and fuel aided this disinflationary impulse, tracking the trough projected in the April MPR. It is important to note, however, that the proportion of items registering price increase was higher in services than in goods (Chart II.4). has been persistent relative to goods inflation 45.9 per cent of the CPI. During 2015-16 so far pre- emptive efforts to ward off food price pressures \u2013 black marketing, suspension of futures trading in select pulses, discouraging exports and incentivising imports of pulses and onions \u2013 worked to moderate Abstracting from base effects, services inflation It is observed that the gap between inflation rates of goods and services has a strong tendency to return to a \u201cconstant equilibrium value\u201d in the long run (Peach, Rich and Antoniades, 2004). In India, goods and services inflation has generally been moving down since January 2014, with goods inflation being more volatile. Goods inflation excluding food and fuel (along with petrol and diesel) trailed services inflation on a similar exclusion basis with both converging to around 5 per cent in August 2015 (Chart a). Empirical evidence points to a long-run cointegrating relationship between the two series, with short-run error correction occurring mostly through goods inflation. Vector error correction model (VECM) estimates suggest that goods inflation needs to adjust by three times services inflation to restore equilibrium. Peach, R.W., Rich, R., and Antoniades, A. (2004), \u201cThe Historical and Recent Behavior of Goods and Services Inflation\u201d, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Economic Policy Review, December. Thus, services inflation turns out to be stickier. inflation, which Accordingly, wholesale price essentially captures goods price movements, may tend to underestimate the underlying inflation process in the current milieu. in all sub-groups, barring pulses, eased (Chart II.6, II.7). Prices of pulses rose by double digits throughout the year so far because of a production shortfall in the previous year, imparting inflexibility to food inflation (Box II.2). Other protein-rich items like meat, fish and milk as also spices and prepared meals exhibited persistent price pressures emanating from demand- supply mismatches, given that the demand for these items is relatively income elastic. In the fuel group, there were no changes in administered prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene. International prices of LPG and kerosene have seen a sharp decline since the second half of 2014 and the divergence between 4 1 - g u A 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A Tracking the magnitude and duration of pulses price cycles suggest that cyclical peaks are similar (Chart a). However, the underlying drivers turned out to be different across different episodes \u2013 in the 2006 and 2012 episodes it was gram, while arhar played an important role in the 2009 episode. Upside pressures Although production of pulses has increased in recent years, it has been inadequate in meeting the growing demand, resulting in a secular increase in imports. Empirical evidence shows that deviations between global and domestic prices are corrected through adjustments in global prices within a period of about 5 months. This would imply that domestic price shocks get transmitted to global prices rather quickly, limiting viability of imports as an inflation control strategy. In this context, technological support to enhance yield as well as wider procurement at MSPs to give farmers downside protection are needed to augment production. administered prices and international prices have considerably narrowed (Chart II.8). As a result, the under-recoveries on LPG and kerosene have declined sharply since 2014-15 (Chart II.9). international commodity prices engendered a Two components that recorded large moderation in Barring some firming up in May-June induced by the hardening of international crude oil and gold prices, CPI excluding food and fuel inflation remained range-bound as a broad disinflationary momentum spread through the economy (Chart II.10). Softening inflation were transport and communications, and and diesel generated the disinflation in respect of transport and communication. However, the pass- through was less than complete: only a third of the August) were reflected in cuts in domestic pump prices (Chart II.11a). Transportation fare reductions were moderate except in the case of air fare, muting prices to consumers (Chart II.11b). Barring the rent, which started since early 2014-15, continued Trimmed mean measures of CPI inflation eased the softening bias getting accentuated from July (Chart II.12). Headline CPI disinflation was also reflected in disinflation for different indices. The WPI has slipped into deflation since Q4 of 2014-15 and the divergence between WPI and CPI inflation widened to 8.7 percentage points by August 2015 (Table II.1). The GDP/GVA deflator mirrored WPI movements; this warrants a careful review of the use of WPI, which does not include services, as the price index for arriving at current/constant price estimates of GDP/GVA (Box II.3). For the farm sector, falling diesel prices and the lower magnitude of revisions in electricity prices for irrigation contributed to benign cost conditions (Chart II.14a). Since the setting of MSPs follows a cost plus approach, these falling costs also translated into a lower order of increase in MSPs. Cost pressures facing producers in farm and non-farm sectors were muted by the decline in international oil and metal prices, easing external cost conditions significantly. Domestic cost drivers were also softer. A comparison of the movements of wholesale input prices with those of wholesale output prices and retail prices indicates that the pass-through to consumers is far from complete (Chart II.13). Rural wage growth, another key determinant of farm costs, remained muted during the current year so far, which further helped in keeping costs low (Chart II.14b). Wage growth in the farm sector was lower than in the non-farm sector, which could indicate that the pressure on wages from shortage in farm labour is ebbing. National income aggregates (GDP and GVA) are estimated at current and constant prices. Under the production approach, volumes are estimated independently for some activities and in others, estimates are prepared at current (constant) prices and the constant (current) price estimates are derived using a suitable price indicator (generally WPI at aggregate or disaggregated level or CPI). This has always been the practice and is followed in both old and new series. Estimates of all activities are aggregated, as appropriate, to arrive at GVA estimates at both constant and current price separately and adjusted for taxes less subsidies to arrive at GDP at market prices. The ratio of current to constant price estimate thus derived is the \u201cimplicit\u201d GDP/GVA price deflator, reflecting overall inflation in all goods and services produced in the economy. Accordingly, the quarterly inflation rate derived from GDP/GVA deflators initially track the movement of the price index used in estimating current/constant price GDP for major In India, to obtain quarterly GVA estimates at current prices from constant prices estimates, WPI is widely used for many sectors. This tends to overstate the extent of price decline in the GDP deflator when WPI is in deflation. Services, which account for over 60 per cent of GVA, are not covered in WPI; yet the WPI is used as deflator for several services activities such as trade, hotels and restaurant, real estate and transportation. Whereas the quarterly GDP/GVA deflator should represent the entire gamut of goods and services produced in the country and provide the most comprehensive measure of inflation in the economy, it is not so by construct. Representing the mixed impact of WPI and CPI inflation, with WPI having a larger weightage, annual inflation rates calculated for quarterly GDP/GVA deflators show a sharp decline since Q1 of 2014-15 to close to zero in Q4 of 2014-15. Wage growth in the organised sector represented by per employee cost has also undergone a deceleration in the current financial year so far, though the extent of moderation varied significantly between manufacturing and services sectors (Chart II.15a). Unit labour cost2, however, increased and prominently so in the manufacturing sector as the value of production and sales decelerated at a faster pace (Chart II.15b). The purchasing managers\u2019 index for manufacturing also endorses these declining pressures in input prices that have translated into lower output prices, especially for the manufacturing firms in intermediate and capital goods categories. Input prices faced by services industries are still rising, though at a much slower pace than in the past. The Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey provides advance assessment of cost pressures. The 70th round of the survey shows declining raw material costs \u2013 constituting half of total cost. Empirical analysis suggests that a one point decline in net response on cost of raw materials is associated with a fall in inflation of industrial raw materials by around 80 basis points in the long-run. In the wake of the influential secular stagnation hypothesis3, deflation risks have drawn some intensity in debate: \u201cIf inflation is the genie, then deflation is the ogre that must be fought decisively\u201d4. More recently, the devaluation of the RMB has increased concerns that \u201cthe risks of a deflationary, secular stagnation in the US would be increased by a large devaluation of the Renminbi\u201d5. 2 Measured by the ratio of staff cost to value of production. 3 Summer, Lawrence H.

The hypothesis highlights a plausible scenario of chronic excess of savings over investment, with zero lower bound for interest rates inhibiting full adjustment between saving and investment. 4 Lagarde, Christine (2014) \u2018The Global Economy in 2014\u2019, National Press Club, Washington DC, January 15. 5 Quote by Lawrence Summer \u2018China\u2019s Renminbi Devaluation May Initiate New Phase in Global Currency War\u2019, New York Times, August 13, 2015. In the recent period, this view has been echoed in the discussions in India on inflation dynamics. The collapse of international commodity prices, the shrinking of international trade volumes relative to global economic activity, the flirtation of the euro area, Japan, Brazil and Russia with recession, successive downgrades of global growth forecasts and more recently, the fears of a pronounced slowdown in China have all been augmented by the persistent contraction in the WPI and the GVA deflator falling to zero. The prescription is that monetary policy should act aggressively to pre-empt deflation in India. Recent research suggests that the roots of slow investment in EMEs and that factors beyond the slowdown in output growth are at work6, but are differentiated across geographies. In Asia, Tobin\u2019s Q plays a key role, as reflected in weaker expectations of future profitability, dimmed by the slowing down of potential output. Tighter financial conditions, both domestic and external, have also been associated with the investment stagnation. A number of studies have also highlighted the decisive role of more country- There are a panoply of duties, taxes, administered price settings and inflexible margins that effectively impede the pass-through of WPI/GDP deflator deflation into retail prices/CPI. At a narrative level, an array of facts can be offered to counter the deflation risk argument in relation to India, including the sequential pick-up in GVA in Q1 in the Central Statistics Office\u2019s (CSO\u2019s) new series. That would, however, trivialise the discussion. The global forces cited earlier are indeed warning of a clear and present danger to the outlook for EMEs, and India cannot be immune. Yet it is important to clearly understand and prepare for the type of risks they portend. Rather than deflation, it is the risk of long drawn global stagnation that we should be concerned about. uncertainties embodied in delayed project approvals and large gaps in implementing infrastructural and other large scale projects have been identified as the major factors driving the recent slump7. If this view is accepted, then resolute fiscal policy and administrative/ regulatory actions are urgently required to contend with the spectre of stagnation. It is only a committed policy stance aimed at removing bottlenecks, addressing factors impeding stalled projects, rekindling cash flows, improving business conditions and enhancing human capital that will set course, monetary policy can play a role, but only as 6 IMF (2015) \u201cWhere are we headed ? Perspectives on Potential Output\u201d, Chapter 3, World Economic Outlook, April. 7 Anand, Rahul and Volodymyr Tulin (2014) \u201cDisentangling India\u2019s Investment Slowdown\u201d IMF Working Paper WP/14/47. Aggregate demand firmed up modestly in the first half of 2015-16, benefiting from resilient consumption demand and an incipient pick-up in investment. Agricultural activity was impacted by deficient rainfall. Industrial production has gained some speed and the acceleration in services has been sustained. A slow and hesitant recovery has coursed unevenly through the first half of 2015-16, nudged essentially by tailwinds rather than robust engines of growth. In specific sectors, some green shoots are springing out of dry ground \u2013 passenger car and commercial vehicle sales; indirect tax collections; optimism on new business in purchasing managers\u2019 survey (services) and pick-up in some elements of urban private consumption. Elsewhere, enabling conditions for a gathering of momentum are taking shape \u2013 a large decline in input costs in manufacturing; a smart turnaround in coal production that fuelled robust electricity generation till distribution constraints set the overcast of gloom across EMEs. Yet, a vigorous and sustained revival of aggregate demand that presages economy remains elusive (Box III.1). Rural demand subdued by lacklustre agricultural activity, stranded banking sector assets continued to operate as binding turning points challenging at all times. For the Indian economy, recent data revisions and short histories characterising measuring potential output as well as in locating post-global crisis years. The heightened uncertainty surrounding the global economy more generally is several of these methodologies suffer from a degree of arbitrariness or consensus flaws and signals of turning points can turn out to be noisy (Boldin, 1994 provides a comprehensive survey). By contrast, Markov switching relies on statistically identifying turning points by estimating the probability of shifts between phases of the growth rate cycle. A regime shift occurs when the growth rate shifts to a new average and the probability of such a turnaround is high, and vice versa. A pragmatic approach to detecting inflexion points against this backdrop is to separate phases of expansion of growth momentum (q-o-q, seasonally adjusted and annualised). This will allow for dating turning points or identifying those dates at which the economy switches and vice versa. A range of methodologies are applied to date these transitions \u2013 clustering in shifts of a broad which summarises coincident, leading and lagging indicators into one series using the volatility of each As depicted in Chart a, smoothed probabilities of a relatively low average GDP growth regime continuing fell in 2003 and persisted around zero up to 2008 (a probability of 0.5 and below indicates a regime shift), which coincides with the high growth period in India\u2019s recent history. Markov switching also accurately detected the slowdown in growth over 3 quarters during the global financial crisis, and the subsequent bounce back from 2009. Beginning in 2011, another regime shift to a relatively lower growth momentum is identified which is continuing, but for a short-lived interruption in 2014 due to the release of the new GDP series (base: 2011-12). A similar pattern is observed in respect of growth in industrial production, which is free of the \u2018new GDP series\u2019 effect (Chart b). In order to corroborate these findings, Markov switching was also applied to the OECD\u2019s composite leading India and to a specially indicator for indicator of activity that constructed composite combines a number of leading, coincident and lagging indicators of growth (such as production of capital goods and consumer goods, real non-food credit, railway and port freight, passenger and commercial vehicle sales) based on principal component analysis (Chart c), Although both the composite indicators point to a gradual pick-up in activity in India, evidence of a turning point in terms of a shift to a higher average growth momentum is not supported by estimated regime switch probabilities which, however, are on a declining path from the second half of 2014-15, but they are yet to cross 0.5 (Chart d). This suggests that an inflexion point in the growth path of the Indian economy and, therefore, a transition to a higher growth trajectory may still be some distance away. John, Joice (2015). \u201cDating Turning Points in India\u2019s Growth Cycles\u201d, mimeo Consumption Expenditure III. Gross Fixed Capital Formation IV. Net Exports Exports Imports Aggregate demand measured by year-on-year changes in real GDP moderated sequentially in Q1 of 2015- 16 in relation to the preceding quarter (Table III.1). Seasonally adjusted, the q-o-q slowdown in GDP in Q1 was even sharper (Chart III.1). Underlying this deceleration, government consumption expenditure did not exhibit the usual rebound that was expected in Q1 from cutbacks in the preceding quarter (Q4 of 2014-15) to meet annual fiscal targets. Furthermore, the contribution of net exports to aggregate demand turned modestly negative in Q1 of 2015-16 with the export contraction deepening as external demand fell away. On the other hand, the contribution of private consumption demand held up sequentially, supported by real income gains accruing from the ongoing disinflation. Alongside, the growth of gross fixed capital formation picked up, increasing its contribution to aggregate demand as the unclogging of stalled projects continued and input costs declined as global commodity prices softened. Turning to Q2, available indicators suggest that aggregate demand conditions have firmed a little further. Private final consumption expenditure exhibited resilience and the production of consumer durables turned up, although rural incomes have been sapped by the impact of the sub-normal monsoon on agriculture as well as the moderation in rural wage growth. This was also reflected in weakening sales of tractors and two wheelers. By contrast, fundamentals of urban consumption have been gradually improving. Purchasing managers\u2019 surveys and indices compiled by other agencies indicate cautious optimism on the employment situation in manufacturing and services. Lending to consumers by banks picked up, partly in response to reduction in interest rates, but also reflecting risk aversion among banks on exposure to industry rather than a durable response to consumer demand. The improvement in passenger car sales in Q1 was sustained in July and August, benefiting to an extent from positive income effects of successive rounds of fuel price reductions. The revival of investment demand in Q1 of 2015-16 is likely to have sustained in Q2. The government\u2019s policy focus on expeditious land acquisition, speedier environmental and other clearances is yielding dividends in the form of a decline in the stock of locked investment as well as in the number of projects (Chart III.2a). Also underway is a rebalancing of the composition of central government expenditure in favour of capital spending, with indications of front- loading in Q2. In anticipation, the flow of resources to the commercial sector has been rising, with non-bank sources more than offsetting the subdued growth of non-food bank credit, and the accommodative stance of monetary policy engendering comfortable liquidity conditions. Lead indicators such as higher production of capital goods, and buoyant production and sales of commercial vehicles point to an improving environment for a revival in new investment spending which have been flagging so far (Chart III.2b). Growth in government final consumption expenditure, which turned up in Q1, has gained pace in the first month of Q2. Both revenue and capital expenditure accelerated, especially in July, with the former driven up by subsidy payments on food and fertilisers, and the latter reflecting higher plan expenditure as a strategy to frontload budgeted spending to support investment and growth (Table III.2). In fact, capital expenditure of the Centre increased by 39.0 per cent during April- July 2015, well above the budgeted growth for the year as a whole, and marking a reversal of the decline in capital expenditure a year ago. Within this category, capital outlays (which exclude loans and advances made by the Centre) increased by 48.3 per cent during April-July 2015. States, which account for around 60 per cent of public capital expenditure, will receive a quantum jump in their share of taxes in line with the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission. This should boost overall investment spending in the economy, given that expenditure multipliers tend to be larger for States relative to the Centre. Gross tax revenues have risen robustly this year so far, led by excise duty collections which expanded by 69.7 per cent during April-August. The buoyancy in excise revenue primarily reflects resource mobilisation efforts in the form of increases in excise duty on petrol and diesel between November 2014 and January 2015, an increase in the clean energy cess MONETARY POLICY REPORT and withdrawal of exemptions for motor vehicles, capital goods and consumer durables. Excluding these \u2018rate hike effects\u2019, excise duty collections would have grown by 9 per cent. Service tax collections rose 21.6 per cent in April-August, again reflecting the increase in service tax rates (inclusive of education cess) effected in June. Direct taxes \u2013 accounting for 42 per cent of total tax collections \u2013 were subdued through April-July. Staggered receipts from spectrum auctions conducted in March 2015 boosted non-tax revenue, while disinvestment proceeds from stake sale also provided a measure of fiscal support. Despite the rising profile of revenues, the step-up in government spending resulted in some deterioration in the Centre\u2019s revenue and fiscal deficits as proportions to budget estimates during April-July 2015. Over the rest of the year, risks to budgetary targets appear evenly balanced. The fuller impact of subsidy reforms viz., deregulation of diesel prices, the new domestic gas pricing policy, the launch of the new universal direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and the new urea policy coupled with lower international commodity prices are expected to reduce subsidy payments. On the downside, the implementation of one rank one pension (OROP) and the 7th Pay Commission award will pose risks to fiscal deficit targets in 2016-17 unless provisions are set aside from this year itself. The realisation of the budgeted disinvestment target assumes critical importance, particularly in the context of avoiding the investment-debilitating compression of expenditure that typically occurs in the last quarter of the year. SEPTEMBER 2015 Net exports declined in Q2, reducing aggregate demand in a difficult external environment in which world trade volumes are slowing and heightened financial market volatility is impacting currencies and prices of tradables. The deterioration in net exports mainly reflected a sharp widening of the merchandise trade deficit as the contraction in exports turned out to be deeper than the decline in imports, offsetting gains in net terms of trade (Chart III.3a). Merchandise exports have been in contraction mode for the ninth successive month up to August, with a sharp decline in unit value realisations wiping out the recent modest growth of volumes. With these contrasting movements in prices and volumes and some evidence of a persistent decline in the price elasticity of exports, the impact of exchange rate depreciation on exports is weaker than in the years leading up to the global crisis of 2008-09 (Chart III.3b). Competitive trade policies and global supply chain dynamics are cited as factors dulling the pass-through of exchange rate changes into export prices and demand1. In terms of the Indian experience, however, a caveat may be in order in view of the large contribution of price/ exchange rate inelastic petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) exports to total exports (about 13 per cent in April-August). Non-oil exports continue to be sensitive to the real exchange rate, even as subdued global demand operates as the key drag on India\u2019s export performance. More generally, the price sensitivity of tradables is being weakened by the wide recourse to non-price measures to curb imports by several economies. Exports of software services were partly damped by declining global Information Technology (IT) spending. 1 Ahmed, S., M. Appendino, and M. Ruta (2015). \u201cDepreciations without Exports? Global Value Chains and the Exchange Rate Elasticity of Exports,\u201d World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 7390, World Bank, Washington. Turning to in international commodity prices has pulled down imports for the ninth consecutive month. Data for June to August indicate a pick-up in demand in volume terms for POL \u2013 mainly for inventory build-up - and gold ahead of the festival season. On the other hand, imports excluding bullion and POL remained weak, reflecting subdued domestic demand. Services imports remained relatively stable. Turning to financing of net exports, net inflows of foreign direct investment have shown resilience in the face of high financial market turbulence, while non-resident Indian deposits have picked up, with rupee denominated flows responding favourably to the depreciation of the rupee. On the other hand, portfolio flows into equity markets have turned negative with sentiment changing due to concerns on the timing of the normalisation of US monetary policy and the devaluation of the Chinese RMB. Indicators of external vulnerability have shown steady improvement. industry showed resilience, service sector activity accelerated, accounting for nearly three fourth of the GVA growth in Q1. Turning to Q2, the progress of the south-west monsoon, which is critical to the quarter\u2019s outturn, has been deficient by 14 per cent so far relative to the long period average. Production weighted deficiency was even higher at 20 per cent and reservoir levels and soil moisture have been adversely affected. Kharif sowing acreage is higher than last year, but it is still below the quinquennial average. First advance estimates indicate that kharif foodgrains production for 2015-16 is up by 3.1 per cent relative to last year. In the industrial sector, a large decline in input costs coincident with the downturn in international commodity prices drove a wedge between production and value addition. The growth of industrial GVA in Q1 kept pace with the momentum recorded in 2014-15 (Table III.3). In terms of its constituents, mining and quarrying was boosted by a step-up in coal production, which also pushed up electricity generation. On the other hand, natural gas production contracted. In the context of the slowdown in economic activity in India, attention has been drawn to the sensitivity of aggregate demand to interest rates. Estimation of IS-type aggregate demand functions over time suggests that sensitivity of the output gap to real interest changes has increased. Every percentage point increase in the real interest rate gap reduces the output gap by 10-13 basis points in the short run and by up to 25-50 basis points in the long- run. There are, however, non-linearities involved. The efficacy of interest rate changes in moving aggregate demand depends on their level relative to the natural interest rate, which is time-varying and sensitive to the rate of change of potential output, apart from factors such as demographics, the saving-investment balance and fiscal/financial/structural reforms2. Output measured by gross value added (GVA) at basic prices firmed up in Q1 on a sequential y-o-y basis, reversing the deceleration in the second half of 2014- 15. Seasonally adjusted q-o-q annualised GVA growth rose even more sharply and was broad-based. GVA in agriculture and allied activities came out of contraction in the last two quarters of 2014-15 and contributed a seventh of the output in Q1. While value added in Expenditure and costs of manufacturing firms listed on stock exchanges declined sharply in real terms (i.e., quarterly nominal sales and expenditure deflated by WPI) and prevented the decline in real sales from eroding corporate earnings (Charts III.4a & b). Industrial activity has gained some speed in Q2 with mining and quarrying and manufacturing sectors sharing the acceleration. In July, manufacturing continued to be powered by the growth of production of furniture, apparel and passenger cars, which suggests that urban consumption demand remains firm. Mining and quarrying activity showed flagging momentum on account of slowing coal production. The use-based classification of industrial activity points to both consumption and investment demand strengthening in Q2. The growth of capital goods production surged in July \u2013 the ninth consecutive month of expansion, barring the small decline in June. Consumer durables also grew strongly for the second month in succession in July. Services sector GVA accelerated in Q1 and accounted for 62 per cent of overall GVA. Over the previous four quarters in succession, services sector growth exceeded 8 per cent, generating income to prop-up 2 Behera, H.K., Pattanaik, S. and Kavediya, R. (2015). \u201cNatural Interest Rate: How to Assess the Stance of India\u2019s Monetary Policy under Uncertainty?\u201d, RBI Working Papers (forthcoming). (i) Mining & quarrying communication and services related to broadcasting consumption demand. In Q2, the pace of activity was sustained, although sectoral constraints are tightening. In the construction sector, activity has slowed and housing inventories are reported to be piling up, especially in the premium sector. Lead indicators of activity in trade, hotels, transport and communication, which constitute about a third of the services sector, pointed to a sustained recovery in Q2 as evident in the improvement in domestic air passenger and freight traffic, cargo handled by major ports and sales of commercial vehicles. Financial, real estate and professional services slowed on banks\u2019 risk aversion in response to stressed assets and tepid investment demand, which was reflected in relatively subdued growth in credit and deposits. The pressure on profits of IT and related companies due to low global demand pulled down growth in professional services, although the depreciation of the rupee in Q2 may provide a boost to this sector going forward. Assessment of the output gap is a continuous exercise in order to examine the state of the economy vis-a-vis the underlying cycle. While estimates of the output gap are highly sensitive to the choice of data and methodology, a broad consensus has evolved around the prevalence of a negative output gap - actual output trailing below potential - since Q3 of 2012-13 (Chart III.5). The presence of slack in the industrial sector is also borne out by the Reserve Bank\u2019s 30th round of the Order Book, Inventory and Capacity Utilisation (OBICUS) survey, which suggests that seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation levels have been below 75 per cent since 2013-14 (Chart III.6)3. So far, real activity in India has evolved well below the path projected in the April 2015 MPR, essentially on account of the subsequent downward revision by 30 basis points in the CSO\u2019s provisional estimates for 2014-15, the base year for the projections. Accounting for this revision and the more recent evidence presented in this chapter, some downward adjustment in these projections is warranted, as given in chapter I. A major step-up in capital expenditure of the government holds the key to sustaining the recent pick-up in the investment cycle, supported by low input costs and defreezing of stalled projects. An early resolution of the stress facing DISCOMs is necessary to restart resource flows to the sector including bank credit. Global excess capacity in specific sectors such as steel may heighten import competition for domestic production, apart from raising risks to asset quality in this sector. Improving the conditions for doing business assumes priority in order to create a conducive environment for a durable revival of investment and growth. 3 According to CRISIL (July, 2015), capacity utilisation in ten out of twelve large industrial sectors is hovering at five-year lows, constraining fresh investments. Its assessment suggests that despite positive growth in public sector capital expenditure in 2015-16, overall capital investment may decline modestly during the year, due to falling net private capital expenditure. 24 Amidst global headwinds and financial market turbulence, money and bond markets in India remained relatively insulated. By contrast, equity and foreign exchange markets were impacted by global financial market turmoil. Credit market activity picked up modestly in specific sectors, though restrained by lingering risk aversion. During the first half of 2015-16, global shocks imparted a marked increase in volatility to financial markets worldwide. Equity and foreign exchange markets in India have been the most impacted though much less than EME peers. By contrast, gilt, money and credit markets have been relatively insulated and have instead exhibited sensitivity to domestic developments such as monsoon deficiency, and impediments in the reform process inhibiting acceleration of the growth momentum. Liquidity conditions have, by and large, been comfortable and financing conditions have generally improved. The uncollateralised inter-bank call money rate serves as the operating target of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity management operations endeavour to keep the call money rate anchored to the policy repo rate. Although call money market turnover accounts for only 10 per cent of the total volume in the overnight segment of the money markets, other rates such as those in the collateralised segments [collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (CBLO) and market repo] closely co-move with the call money rate, despite non-bank participants such as mutual funds contributing around 50 per cent of the total volume in the CBLO segment. Money market conditions evolved in distinct phases over the first half of 2015-16. As government spending resumed after the restraint exercised in Q4 of 2014- 15 to meet fiscal targets and banks unwound year- end \u2018window dressing\u2019, money market rates softened below the policy rate in the first half of April, reflecting abundant liquidity. During mid-April to May, transient tightness set in as government spending decelerated. As a consequence, the overnight call money rate hovered around or a little above the policy rate (Chart IV.1a). From June onwards, however, the combined impact of a pick-up in the government\u2019s capital expenditure and the growing structural liquidity surplus (emanating from higher deposit mobilisation relative to credit off-take) pushed money market rates persistently below the repo rate up to the mid- September advance tax outflows. Since then, interest rates in the money markets have firmed up and have been trading tightly around the repo rate. The average spread of the daily weighted average call money rate (WACMR) vis-a-vis the repo rate (excluding Saturdays) widened from (-)9 bps during Q1 of 2015-16 to (-)18 bps during Q2 (up to September 28), reflecting surplus liquidity conditions. The volatility in daily money market rates, measured through generalised autoregressive heteroscedasticity (GARCH), declined significantly (Chart IV.1b). Under the revised liquidity management framework instituted in September 2014, variable rate repo/ reverse repo operations of tenor ranging from overnight to 28 days are conducted to match diverse liquidity needs and assessments of market participants. In response, average daily trading volume in the uncollateralised term money and CBLO segments recorded an increase to `2.2 billion and `90.7 billion, respectively, during the first half of 2015-16 (up to September 24) from `1.9 billion and `89.9 billion during the same period last year. Factors such as lending through cash credit, inadequate treasury management by banks/ corporates and large unforeseen shifts in government spending continue to inhibit the fuller development of the term money market. Since 2014-15, the commercial paper (CPs) market has been an attractive source of short-term funding for corporates. The weighted average discount rate (WADR) on CPs has traded below banks\u2019 weighted average lending rates (WALR) on fresh rupee loans by 275 bps, on an average, in 2014-15 and by 301 bps in 2015-16 so far. Moreover, between January and mid- September, the WADR declined by 75 bps, indicative of full transmission of policy rate cuts. Consequently, CP issuances have risen by about 40 per cent on a y-o-y basis up to September 15 (Chart IV.2a). Over 60 per cent of these issuances were in the maturity bucket of 31-90 days. Banks\u2019 investment in CPs have grown, reflecting increased credit risk aversion embedded in stressed assets, and CPs offer an attractive alternative for investment of funds, given surplus liquidity conditions. In contrast, outstanding certificates of deposit (CDs) declined by about 68 per cent during April-September 14, 2015 indicating reduction in banks\u2019 dependence on short-term market based funding (Chart IV.2b). Banks\u2019 appetite for bulk deposits, including CDs, has come down with deposit growth running ahead of credit off-take. As a result, the effective CD rate declined by about 100 bps, closing the gap between the one year deposit rate and the 90-day CD rate. In Q1 of 2015-16, yields in the government securities (g-sec) market hardened in April on bearish sentiment related to the unchanged stance of monetary policy and weakening of the rupee, briefly interrupted by some easing on Moody\u2019s upgrade of the outlook for India. Yields came under renewed pressure again during the first half of May and June due to the global bond market sell-off originating with German 10-year bonds, the elevated size of the government market borrowing programme and concerns over forecasts of a sub-normal monsoon, leading to a vertical shift in the yield curve in June over March (Chart IV.3). In Q2, yields moved in a narrow range in July and the greater part of August, trading with a soft bias as crude prices eased on expectations of Iran\u2019s re-entry into the oil market. Yields also tracked US treasuries as worries over Greece and the bursting of the stock market bubble in China triggered flights to safe haven. The \u2018black Monday\u2019 crash in the Shanghai composite index on August 24 caused yields to jump by 11 bps which, however, was short-lived. Thereafter, yields softened in anticipation of further easing of the monetary policy in response to decline in inflation, and the deferment of the US monetary policy action in the FOMC meeting of September 17. The yield spread between 10-year and 1-year g-sec, which was negative prior to June turned positive, suggesting some optimism about near-term growth prospects. Foreign portfolio cumulative investors\u2019 investment in the debt market amounted to US$ 57.3 billion as on September 24, 2015 with FPIs almost exhausting their g-sec investment limit. During April- September 24, 2015, there were portfolio outflows of `195 billion with outflow from the debt segment being limited (Chart IV.4). The increased participation of FPIs in the g-sec market has widened the investor base and contributed to an increasing level of integration between the Indian and the global bond markets evidenced by the co-movements of yields (Chart IV.5). Primary issuances in the corporate bond market rose through the first half of 2015-16, almost entirely due to private placement, which could be substituting for bank credit. The secondary market remained sluggish, reflecting declining liquidity in corporate bonds. Yields of AAA rated corporate bonds largely tracked g-sec yields with the yield spread showing signs of softness in the recent period, indicative of easing financing conditions (Chart IV.6). FPIs\u2019 investment in corporate bonds stood at about `1,860 billion as on September 24, 2015, amounting to 76 per cent of the limit. In the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate came under repeated bouts of downward pressure in Q1 on negative sentiments stemming from a combination of domestic and global developments \u2013 contraction in exports; portfolio outflows on concerns relating to taxation; the Greek crisis; global bond market sell-off; and hardening of crude oil prices (Chart IV.7a). The exchange rate of the rupee moved in the range of `62.2 to `64.2 in Q1, spiking to ` 63.6 on April 27 and again to `64.2 on May 12. The rupee traded with a depreciating bias throughout June in response to forecasts of a sub-normal monsoon and data indicating a strong US economy and, therefore, a sooner normalisation of US monetary policy. In Q2, there were two-way movements in July, with positive sentiment generated initially by the conclusion of the nuclear agreement with Iran, followed by a weakening in the second half of the month as large sell-offs in Chinese equity markets triggered plunges across emerging markets. After a brief respite, the rupee came under pressure breaching the level of `65 by mid-August to `66 by end-August triggered by devaluation of the Chinese RMB on August 11 and the Chinese stock market meltdown on August 24. The rupee stabilised in September and traded in a narrow range, with the FOMC\u2019s decision to hold off rate increases imparting a mild appreciation bias. Accordingly, the volatility in the rupee-dollar exchange rate, as measured through GARCH, remained contained during May to mid-August and heightened thereafter (Chart IV.7b). Nevertheless, the rupee fared relatively better than other EME currencies during 2015-16 so far (see Chart V. 6b of Chapter V). In the forward segment, premia declined during the first half of 2015-16, reflecting the narrowing of interest rate differentials (Chart IV.8). The forward exchange rate in the domestic market and non-deliverable forward (NDF) market moved in consonance. In the equities market, the rally witnessed in the second half of 2014-15 lost steam in Q1 of 2015- 16, with the MSCI India index trailing behind its emerging market peers (Chart IV.9a). Poor monsoon forecasts and slower than anticipated pace of reforms pulled down share prices in India. In Q2, however, equity markets in India staged a smart recovery and remained above the MSCI EM Index, taking cues from relatively greater resilience of the Indian rupee As policy interventions by the Chinese authorities failed to allay investor concerns about the ongoing slowdown, in Indian equity markets late August and early September on the back of a global sell-off. After scaling a high of 29682 on January 29, the sensex was about 14 per cent down by September 28. tumbled During 2015-16 so far (up to end August), resource mobilisation through the primary capital market improved significantly, mainly through equity issuances (Chart IV.10). In the credit market, credit off-take during the first half of 2015-16 has been higher than in the corresponding period of previous years, barring 2013-14 (Chart IV.11). Private sector banks were again the largest lender group in the first half of the year. Incremental lending has been mostly to the personal loan segment, especially housing, reflecting resilience of consumer demand and the aversion of banks to stressed sectors. The total flow of resources to the commercial sector was higher during the financial year so far than a year ago (Table IV.1). In response to the reduction in the policy repo rate by 75 bps since January 2015, banks\u2019 median base rates have fallen by 30 bps (Table IV.2). WALR on fresh rupee loans have, however, declined by 43 bps. Incomplete pass-through reflects the presence of structural rigidities in the credit market: (a) mobilisation of deposits at fixed rates with only about 20 per cent of term deposits getting re-priced during a year; (b) competition from small savings schemes Table IV.2: Deposit and Lending Rates of SCBs (excluding RRBs) B1.

A financial conditions index1 (FCI) constructed by estimating principal components tracks GVA growth closely with a one quarter lead with a high correlation (0.73) (Chart IV.12). Liquidity conditions were generally tight during Q1 of 2015-16 mainly due to restrained government spending. In Q2, however, liquidity conditions eased The cross-country experience on monetary policy transmission to deposit and lending rates suggests that: (i) corporate lending rates are much more responsive to changes in the policy rate than deposit or household/consumer loan rates; (ii) banks with the largest market shares price their products less competitively; (iii) for the majority of products, the pass-through is incomplete even in the long-run; (iv) deposit rates adjust faster downward than upward; (v) where loan market competition is strong and higher than in the deposit markets, deposit rates are kept lower; (vi) shorter term rates show higher degree of pass-through and faster adjustment speed than longer term rates; and (vii) the long-run pass-through is higher for unsecured personal loans and cash credit than for mortgages, which provides evidence of a collateral effect. In the Indian context, an empirical exercise based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain based Gibbs sampling with monthly data from March 2013 to June 2015 reveals that a 100 bps shock to WACMR affects weighted average term deposit rates (WATDR) and WALR cumulatively by 36 bps and 31 bps, respectively, over a horizon of 3 quarters. On the other hand, changes in WATDR pass over to WALR fully within a much shorter period, according it primacy in determining the cost of funds. Finally, as the supply and demand of funding credit needs is intermediated by the overall holdings of sovereign SLR securities by banks, its impact on WALR (contd...) 1 The index uses monthly data on financial variables such as non-food credit, money supply, total capital raised by corporates, sensex, equity volatility, nominal exchange rate, spread between 3-month TB and WACR, spread between 10 year sovereign yield between India and the US, and spread between 10 year AAA corporate bond and 10 year G-sec yield (Khundrakpam, J. et al. 2015 forthcoming). is found to be significant owing to the pre-emption of banking resources. Fiscal rectitude and consequent drawdown of g-sec holdings by banks can thus greatly help in fostering monetary policy transmission. The limited effectiveness of monetary policy transmission to lending rates can be attributed to imperfections in financial markets, as mentioned earlier. The recently announced draft guidelines on determination of base rates based on marginal cost of funding are likely to improve monetary policy transmission.

On a y-o-y basis, reserve money growth was significantly higher at 12.3 per cent as on September 18, 2015 than 9.6 per cent a year ago. The y-o-y growth rate in broad money decelerated to 11.2 per cent as on September 4, 2015 from 13.0 per cent a year ago. To sum up, financial markets in India have been impacted by risk-on risk-off investor sentiment triggered by global uncertainties. Global market turbulence and evolution of overall global liquidity conditions will have a determining influence on domestic financial markets going forward. Global economic activity has moderated with EMEs slowing down, while the recovery in AEs remains tepid. Depressed commodity prices have kept inflation conditions generally benign. Accordingly, monetary policy is accommodative across countries. High financial market turbulence has emerged as the biggest risk to global growth and financial stability. Since the MPR of April 2015, the pick-up in global growth in Q2 of 2015 appears to be moderating in Q3, hamstrung by the persisting loss of speed in EMEs - which constitute 57 per cent of global GDP in purchasing power parity terms - and the continuing lack of traction in the recovery in AEs. Industrial production in major economies decelerated in July and August, and the volume of world trade continues to contract. Going forward, macroeconomic risks have been accentuated by high uncertainty surrounding the slowdown in China and its global spillovers. energy sector capital expenditure. In the Euro area, the modest recovery that set in during the first half of 2015 firmed up in Q3 on lower energy prices and gradual pickup in bank lending to the private sector. Activity in the UK was sustained by the strength of domestic demand, especially consumption, while exports continued to contract, hurt by appreciation of the sterling. The Japanese economy has weakened further - following the contraction in Q2 - due to slackening consumer spending and shrinking exports (Table V.1). Global financial markets experienced bouts of volatility in Q2, triggered by the global bond market in Germany, uncertainty sell-off originating surrounding the resolution of the Greek crisis and the incoming data-driven risk swings associated with the impending normalisation of US monetary policy. In Q3, volatility has re-emerged in financial markets, starting with the bursting of the equity bubble in China and fanned by significant policy intervention failures. The meltdown set off large declines in equity markets and currencies across EMEs and further slumps in commodities. Investors have shunned EMEs as an asset class in a rush to safe haven, causing accelerated capital outflows, depreciating exchange rates, hardening of bond yields and widening of risk spreads all of which have worked to tighten financing conditions facing these economies. Consequently, several EMEs have had from accommodative monetary policy stances to protect financial stability. In AEs by contrast, monetary policy remains ultra-accommodative and expectations relating to raising of the target Federal Funds rate have been pushed out. to step back Most EMEs have slowed down further, albeit at varying speeds, due to a combination of adverse factors - falling commodity prices, tighter external financial concerns and country-specific structural fragilities \u2013 further compounded by the slowdown in China. High frequency indicators, including purchasing managers In the United States, the robust pick-up in economic activity in Q2 lost some momentum in Q3, reflecting slowing manufacturing and exports, and cuts in indices, industrial production and imports point to further deceleration in Q3 in China in an environment of slowing residential construction activity, declining investment efficiency and rising debt levels. The recession in Brazil and Russia is set to deepen further, amidst falling commodity prices and high inflation weighing on consumer and investment demand. South Africa is on the edge of recession as power shortages become binding amidst weak global demand and rising labour cost. In the second half of 2015, AEs are expected to lead the global economy, gaining from lower oil prices, the ebbing drag accommodative stance of monetary policy. The near- term outlook for these economies nonetheless remains weak. On the other hand, risks to global growth are developing from the continuing weakening of growth in EMEs, growing vulnerabilities to currency depreciation, capital outflows disrupting financial markets and asset prices, and rising levels of indebtedness. The OECD\u2019s leading indicators suggest that growth in major economies, including the US, could taper (Chart V.1a). Purchasing managers\u2019 indices for manufacturing indicate business conditions are turning down modestly in the US and Euro area, but worsening more sharply in some major EMEs (Chart V.1b). The momentum of global trade volume remained weak in the first half of 2015, largely owing to sharper fall in import volumes in EMEs than in AEs (Chart V.2). Import contraction in value terms was particularly pronounced across EMEs. Global commodity prices continued to soften on supply glut conditions and weak demand from EMEs. Crude oil prices rebounded in Q2 on stronger demand, but tumbled in August 2015 to their lowest level since February 2009 on concerns of slowdown in China, high inventory levels in the US and supply escalation, particularly from Iran. Prices of basic metals have remained weak owing mainly to slowdown in construction, infrastructure spending and industrial activity in metal importing countries along with supply increases and renewed strength of the US dollar. Global food prices remained low as major foodgrains and edible oils remained well supplied with adequate production. Panel rolling auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) models1 show that both energy and non-energy prices have had a significant influence on inflation in AEs and commodity importing EMEs. While this impact has tended to increase over the period 2013Q2 to 2015Q2 in AEs, it has broadly remained stable in EMEs, indicating that these prices play a larger role in inflation formation in the former than in the latter (Chart V.3a and b). September meeting. The Bank of England also trimmed its inflation forecasts and delayed interest rate increases. For the European Central Bank (ECB), meeting its inflation target has become increasingly difficult with falling oil prices and appreciation of the euro following the stock market turmoil of August. The ECB has indicated the possibility of larger asset purchases going forward. In Japan, the weakening of near-term growth prospects could induce further monetary easing. In the US, inflation remains low despite the recent uptick driven by housing costs. Although the Euro area exited deflation in May, fears of a renewed downward spiral have increased, arising from depressed commodity prices and strengthening of the euro in late August. Similarly, deflation worries persist in Japan, with inflation dipping in July due to weak domestic demand and low energy prices. In some EMEs, inflation risks have turned up on structural currency depreciation, which have overwhelmed the impact of softening commodity prices. Inflation is elevated in Brazil and Russia in spite of recession in these economies. In Turkey, Indonesia and South Africa, inflation remains high because of structural rigidities. On the other hand, policy stances in EMEs remain mixed. The recent cut in benchmark lending and deposit rates, and currency devaluation in China had spillover effects on other EMEs. Despite runaway inflation, Russia has been cutting rates to counter recession. Turkey and Indonesia have kept their policy rates intact in the face of growth slowdown, while intervening in the foreign exchange market to contain currency depreciation. Thailand and Korea have been emboldened by subdued inflation to cut rates to spur export demand. Brazil, on the other hand, raised its policy rate to counter inflation due to currency depreciation pressure, despite recessionary conditions intensifying. South Africa raised its policy rate in July to curb inflation (Chart V.4). The stance of monetary policy across most economies continues to be highly accommodative, but set to diverge. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deferred the normalisation of monetary policy in its Developments in global financial markets during Q2 of 2015 and in Q3 are in stark contrast. In Q2, ultra- accommodative monetary policy in AEs buoyed asset prices across all classes. Conditions altered drastically in Q3, with the protracted Greece negotiations initially, and later with the sharp fall in Chinese equity prices and RMB devaluation weakening investor sentiment precipitously. In the fixed income markets, yields on government bonds fell to record lows in April and in Europe, a significant amount of sovereign debt traded at negative yields (Charts V.5). By end-April, growing investor unease against the backdrop of the brewing crisis in Greece, expanded asset purchases by the ECB and liquidity shortages due to regulatory changes under Basel III provoked a sell-off in the German bund market in which 10-year yields shot up by close to 80 basis points during May and June. In Europe, bond yields tracked the widening of Greek CDS spreads and fell when negotiations failed. However, contagion was limited when the likelihood of a new programme gained ground in July. Even though bond markets remained largely resilient to the Chinese stock market meltdown since late June, the rush for exit by jittery investors pulled down government bond yields everywhere. This short-lived but unusual cross-border transmission of bond market impulses, driven by the rapid turnaround in investor sentiment, suggests that as the trajectory of monetary policy becomes clearer in AEs, long term yields could play a significant role in the evolution of monetary conditions in EMEs, heightening the dilemmas they Equity prices in Q2 rose to record highs in AEs and EMEs alike driven by search for yield \u2013 the Shanghai Composite rose by 114 per cent \u2013 and stretched valuations began to become evident in the surge in P/E ratios across the world. The sharp fall in Chinese equity prices in late June and July spilled over to other markets in Asia, affecting commodity markets and weakening exchange rates. Although equity prices stabilised in late July and early August, the RMB devaluation of August 11, followed by downslides till early September, was interpreted by markets as a sign of deeper weaknesses in the Chinese economy. The turbulent fall in Chinese equities by 8.5 per cent on August 24, 2015, dubbed as \u201cBlack Monday\u201d, cleaved through the global stock markets \u2013 US markets fell by 3.9 per cent, Euro area by 5.4 per cent and EMEs by 5.0 per cent (Chart V.6a). Subsequent to the Fed\u2019s pause on September 17, portfolio inflows to select EMEs have resumed. Volatility resurfaced in equity and currency markets in late September triggered by a stock sell-off in Germany and weaker than expected Chinese manufacturing. In the foreign exchange markets, the broad dollar index depreciated by 2.6 per cent over the period April to mid-May in response to bearish sentiment triggered by the contraction of the US economy in the preceding Since the early 2000s, an unfolding channel of financial linkage between economies has been global long-term interest rates. Financial sector reforms, globalisation and an intensification of the search for yields in the years after the global crisis enabled many EME governments to issue long-term local currency bonds in international markets to take advantage of the low term premium induced by quantitative easing. Aggregate borrowing by non-banks outside the US in US dollar bond markets since the start of 2000 multiplied by more than four times to about US$ 4.5 trillion by the first quarter of 2015 (McCauley et al., 2015). A consequence has been that domestic long-term interest rates in EMEs have been directly impacted by global long-term interest rates, while becoming less responsive to domestic short-term policy rates (Turner, 2015). This has set up a monetary policy dilemma for EMEs: very low long-term interest rates in AEs induced large scale capital flows to EMEs causing exchange rate appreciation, easing of domestic bond yields and liquidity conditions which, in turn, expanded credit conditions. By contrast, as the experience with the RMB devaluation showed, generalised risk aversion and capital outflows depreciated EME currencies and tightened monetary conditions. Going forward, as the normalisation of US monetary policy nears, will central banks in EMEs be forced to react to movements in global long-term interest rates through policy rate changes? For BRIICS countries (including Indonesia), panel VAR analysis comprising domestic long-term yield, short-term rates, industrial production, inflation and exchange rate and US long-term yield for the period June 2009 to June 2015 reveals that a 100 basis point rise in the US 10-year yield is associated with more than 40 basis points increase in the 10-year yield, corroborating Turner (2015) for eight EMEs and Miyajima et al., (2014) for five Asian economies. However, unlike in the latter, short-term rates in BRIICS do not respond to the US 10- year yield. Even though domestic short-term rates have the impact is lower than that of the US 10-year yield, similar to Turner (2015) (Charts a to d). These suggest that even though monetary policy in BRIICS could get constrained by movements in global long-term yields, policy rate changes may continue to be determined quarter, downgrades to growth projections by the FOMC, fears about a slowing China and deflation risks globally. By May, however, improved data on retail sales, wage growth and consumer confidence renewed the strength of the US dollar, with safe haven demand and unwinding of carry trades after the bond market sell-off adding support to another rally that took the US dollar to its highest level since 2003 on September 7. By contrast, the euro, which had depreciated by 9.7 per cent during Q2 as quantitative easing by the ECB was enlarged, appreciated modestly in the subsequent period. EME currencies, which have in general Miyajima, Ken, M.S. Mohanty and James Yetman (2014), \u201cSpillovers of US unconventional monetary policy to Asia: the role of long-term interest rates\u201d, BIS Working Papers No.478. depreciated since end-March 2015 implying their weak fundamentals and/or adverse terms of trade, plunged following the RMB devaluation on August 11 as foreign portfolio investors rushed for safety (Charts V. 6b). In sum, the current soft patch in the global economy is expected to continue in the near term as downside risks have increased significantly. While lower commodity and oil prices augur well for demand in oil importing economies, especially AEs, China\u2019s economic outlook will be a key factor for growth prospects of commodity exporters and other major EMEs.
