{"file1": "The first meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on October 3 and 4, 2016 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, 2. Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; and Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the amended Act); Shri R. Gandhi, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:\u2014 (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on resolutions adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, feedback from industry associations and the projections of professional forecasters. The Committee reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook and staff\u2019s quarterly projection model. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic basis points from 6.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent with immediate effect. reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 6. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.75 per cent. 7. The decision of the MPC is consistent with an accommodative stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Global growth has been slowing more than anticipated through 2016 so far, 8. with weak investment and trade damping aggregate demand. Meanwhile, risks in the form of Brexit, banking stress in Europe, rebalancing of debt-fuelled growth in China, rising protectionism and diminishing confidence in monetary policy have slanted the outlook to the downside. World trade volume has contracted sharper than expected in the first half of 2016, and the outlook has worsened with the recent falling off of imports by advanced economies (AEs) from emerging market economies (EMEs). Inflation remains subdued in AEs and has started to edge down in EMEs. 9. International financial markets were overwhelmed by the Brexit vote in Q2, with equity markets losing valuations worldwide, currencies plunging and turning volatile, and investors rushing for safe havens. Markets, however, recovered quickly and reclaimed lost ground in Q3, with a return of risk appetite propelling capital flows back into EMEs. Nonetheless, an uneasy calm prevails on uncertainty about the stance of monetary policy of systemic central banks. Commodity prices have firmed up slightly, easing stress for commodity exporters and shaving off some of the terms of trade gains accruing to commodity importers. Crude prices rose to a recent peak in Q2 of 2016, mostly on supply disruption in various parts of the world, and again in late September as the OPEC announced intentions of cutting back on supply; but, the upturn has been curbed by higher inventories. 10. On the domestic front, the outlook for agricultural activity has brightened considerably. The south west monsoon ended the season with a cumulative deficit of only 3 per cent below the long period average, with 85 per cent of the country\u2019s geographical area having received normal to excess precipitation. Kharif sowing has surpassed last year\u2019s acreage, barring cotton, sugarcane and jute and mesta. Accordingly, the first advance estimates of kharif foodgrains production for 2016-17 by the Ministry of Agriculture have been placed at a record level, and higher than the target set for the year. The industrial sector, by contrast, suffered a manufacturing- driven contraction in early fiscal year Q2, after a sequential deceleration in gross value added in Q1. Even after trimming the statistical effects of the lumpy and order- driven contraction of insulated rubber cables, industrial production as measured by the index of industrial production (IIP) turned out to be slower than a year ago. In August, steel production rose to a 37-month high and cement production maintained momentum - auguring well for construction activity - even though the output of core industries as a whole was weighed down by a decline in the production of coal, crude oil and natural gas and deceleration in refinery products and electricity generation. Nonetheless, business expectations polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey and by other agencies remain expansionary in Q2 and Q3. The strong public investment in roads, railways and inland waterways, the recent efforts to unclog cash flows in large projects under arbitration, and the boost to spending from the 7th Pay Commission\u2019s award, should improve the industrial outlook. In the services sector, the acceleration in the pace of activity in Q1 appears to have been sustained. An increasing number of high frequency indicators are moving into positive territory, construction is boosted by policy initiatives, and public administration, defence and other services will be supported by the pay commission award. 11. Retail inflation measured by the headline CPI had been elevated by a sharp pick-up in the momentum of food inflation overwhelming favourable base effects during April-July. In August, however, the momentum of food inflation turned negative and surprised expectations; consequently, base effects in that month came into full play and pulled down headline inflation to an intra-year low. Fuel inflation has moderated steadily through the year so far. Inflation excluding food and fuel (including petrol and diesel embedded in transportation) has been sticky around 5 per cent, mainly in respect to education, medical and personal care services. Households reacted to the recent hardening of food inflation adaptively and raised their inflation expectations in the September 2016 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households. Input costs in the manufacturing sector, including staff costs, have firmed up slightly as evident in various surveys, but the presence of considerable slack has restrained their transmission into corporate pricing power. 12. Liquidity conditions have remained comfortable in Q3, with the Reserve Bank absorbing liquidity on a net basis through variable rate reverse repo auctions of varying tenors. Liquidity was injected through open market purchases of ` 200 billion in line with the system\u2019s requirements. As a result, the weighted average call money rate (WACR) remained tightly aligned with the policy repo rate and, in fact, traded with a soft bias. Interest rates on commercial paper (CPs) and certificates of deposit (CD) also eased. 13. In the external sector, merchandise exports contracted in the first two months of Q2. Subdued domestic demand was, however, reflected in a faster contraction in imports. Moreover, the still soft crude prices pared off a fifth of the oil import bill and gold import volume slumped to a fifth of its volume a year ago. Consequently, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed by US$ 10 billion in April-August on a year-on- year basis. These developments are likely to have contained the current account deficit in Q2 at its level in Q1, although the decline in remittances and the flattening of software earnings warrants monitoring. While the pace of foreign direct investment slowed compared to a year ago, portfolio flows were stronger after the Brexit vote, galvanised by a search for returns in an expanding universe of negative yields. The level of foreign exchange reserves rose to US$ 372 billion by September 30, 2016 \u2013 an all-time high. 14. The Committee expects that the strong improvement in sowing, along with supply management measures, will improve the food inflation outlook. It notes that the sharp drop in inflation reflects a downward shift in the momentum of food inflation \u2013 which holds the key to future inflation outcomes \u2013 rather than merely the statistical effects of a favourable base effect. The Government has announced several measures to cool food inflation pressures, especially with regard to pulses. These measures should help in moderating the momentum of food inflation in the months ahead. This has opened up space for policy action, as indicated in the third bi- monthly monetary policy statement. The easy liquidity conditions engendered by the Reserve Bank\u2019s operations should also enable the smooth transmission of the policy action through various market segments. Furthermore, banks should find added impetus for better transmission by the recent downward adjustment in small savings rates. The Committee took note of potential cost push pressures that may emerge, including the 7th pay commission award on house rent allowances, and the increase in minimum wages with possible spillovers through minimum support prices. The fuller play of these factors will need vigilance to prevent a generalised cost spiral from taking root. On balance, the Committee envisages a trajectory taking headline CPI inflation towards a central tendency of 5 per cent by March 2017, with risks tilted to the upside albeit lower than in the second and third bi-monthly monetary policy statements of June and August respectively (Chart 1). 15. The momentum of growth is expected to quicken with a normal monsoon raising agricultural growth and rural demand, as well as by the stimulus to the urban consumption spending from the pay commission\u2019s award. The accommodative stance of monetary policy and comfortable liquidity conditions should support a revival of credit to the productive sectors. The continuing sluggishness in world trade and smaller terms of trade gains than in the past point, however, to further slackening of external demand going forward. Accordingly, the projection of growth of real gross value added (GVA) for 2016-17 is retained at 7.6 per cent, with risks evenly balanced around it (Chart 2). 16. Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on October 18, 2016. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on December 6 and 7, 2016 and its resolution will be announced on December 7, 2016. Voting on the Resolution to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points 17. In view of a good monsoon, a decline in food inflation and better food supply management by the government, there has been some abatement of both cyclical and structural risks to the March 2017 consumer price index (CPI) inflation target. With persistent slack in the economy evidenced by unutilised capacity over the past few years, corporate pricing power remains weak. The persistence of core inflation remains a concern. While I recognise that upside risks to meeting the objective of 5 per cent CPI inflation by Q4 of 2016-17 remain, given the current juncture, these are acceptable risks. Expectations of future inflation at the monetary policy horizon, as evidenced by the survey of professional forecasters, are closer to the inflation target, which is also expected to contribute to low and stable inflation. 18. On growth, there are signs of revival of economic activity, which needs to be nurtured. 19. Taking into account these considerations, I vote for a 25 basis points (bps) cut in the policy repo rate from 6.50 per cent to 6.25 per cent at today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. 20. The modest softening of inflation and inflation expectations seen in some of the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank, along with lacklustre private investment spending and unused capacity, provides a window for a reduction in the policy rate. 21. While RBI\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of Households suggests elevated inflation expectations, the Consumer Confidence Survey presents an encouraging outlook for the price situation as well as future economic conditions. Further, while RBI\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey suggests some increase in input price pressures in the manufacturing sector in the short-run, this is not expected to transmit to higher selling prices. On the other hand, input cost expectations are muted in the infrastructure sector. Additionally, the Survey of Professional Forecasters suggests anchoring of inflation expectations. In this backdrop, I feel that it is a good time to support growth by reducing the 22. policy rate. 23. Accordingly, I vote for a 25 basis points (bps) cut in the policy repo rate from 6.50 per cent to 6.25 per cent at today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. 24. Some of the upside risks to inflation discussed in the MPC meeting on October 3 and 4, 2016, particularly arising out of the award of the 7th Pay Commission, are largely statistical according to me. Looking forward, in my opinion, the probability of inflation turning up from the current level is reasonably less. On the other hand, there are good chances for the consumer inflation to soften further substantially, benefiting from a good monsoon, supply management measures of the Government and ongoing reforms gaining traction in terms of reducing costs and improving output response. 25. As far as the growth outlook is concerned, I hold the view that the potential growth path of the Indian economy is gradually moving up, particularly in response to several reform measures implemented by the Government. Since there is substantial under-utilisation of capacity in the system, I do not see major risk to inflation if the output gap closes fast. The above assessment gives me the comfort to vote in favour of a cut in the repo rate by 25 basis points. 26. I vote for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and I fully endorse the rationale for the decision set out in the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement. 27. Several parts of the economy are languishing, but as the statement points out, other parts \u2013 agricultural activity; steel production; public investment in roads, railways and inland waterways; some categories of services; transmission of policy impulses through financial markets stimulated by ample liquidity; foreign portfolio investment \u2013 are mending and coming together for a potential revival. The most important among these positives is the improvement in the inflation outlook. In a framework in which inflation forecasts congeal all available information and serve as the intermediate target of monetary policy, two aspects are noteworthy: (a) the level of the inflation forecast for Q4 of 2016-17 is closer to the target than before; and (b) it has been moving down in relation to the second and third bi-monthly statement projections. This is not to say that the beast has been beaten or it\u2019s back broken, but there is a turn in its momentum that is exploitable, especially by measures that hold down month-on-month changes in prices of essential food items. Moreover, the reduction in inflation in August is more real than statistical \u2013 a collapse in momentum which allowed the play of base effects. If the beneficial effects of the satisfactory monsoon keep momentum muted and take inflation below the projection for Q3, the target for Q4 should be achievable. Therefore, while staying focused on the path of disinflation set out in previous monetary policy statements, it is, in my view, most timely now to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points and drive the actualisation of the macroeconomic configuration that seems to be forming \u2013 a reasonable probability of inflation converging to its target and the economy poised on the threshold of an acceleration of growth in the next three quarters of the year. It is crucial, however, to step up vigil around the upturn in inflation projected in the last quarter of 2016-17 to guard against any risk to the target. Statement by Shri R. Gandhi 28. I agree with the assessment of risks to growth and inflation presented in the MPC resolution and vote in favour of lowering the policy repo rate by 25 basis points because of the following specific reasons. 29. While risks to India\u2019s growth from a still fragile global economy have increased, particularly through the trade channel, risks to inflation from global factors may be easing, going by the observed high intensity and spread of global disinflation. 30. From amongst the domestic sources of risks to inflation, I see the maximum comfort coming from pulses. The first advance estimates of kharif foodgrains point to pulses production rising by 57 per cent this year. Despite two consecutive years of droughts, food inflation could be contained because of effective supply management measures by the Government. With a normal monsoon this year, I expect food inflation to stay even more firmly contained. Given the high weight of food in the CPI basket, supply response and supply management will remain critically important to influence the space for monetary policy actions. 31. On the growth front, while the pace is expected to gain gradual momentum, the private investment cycle remains depressed and is yet to respond adequately to the improving consumption demand. Recent data on production of capital goods, imports of capital goods and flow of credit to industry indicate the weak state of investment demand. In this environment, a rate cut according to me will help in stimulating investment demand while also easing somewhat the pressure on firms stemming from balance sheet repairs. Indicators of economic activity pointed to a subdued outlook, though gradually 32. improving; further, continuing low capacity utilisation in industry and the persistence of the output gap suggested that pricing power is likely to remain low. Importantly, high frequency data embedded in our forward-looking surveys as well as daily movements in prices of fruits and vegetables, cereals and even pulses across the country gave us some confidence that the inflation target of 5 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 can be achieved. Therefore, while our model-based projections indicated upside risks to the target, a calibrated policy judgement was warranted, given that some space for policy action had opened up with the fall in inflation in the August reading. Nonetheless, inflation outcomes in Q4 will have to be carefully and continuously monitored as upside risks, albeit lower now than before, persist.

Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.25 per cent. 6. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. 7. The decision of the MPC is consistent with an accommodative stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 8. Global growth picked up modestly in the second half of 2016, after weakening in the first half. Activity in advanced economies (AEs) improved hesitantly, led by a rebound in the US. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), growth has moderated, but policy stimulus in China and some easing of stress in the larger commodity exporters shored up momentum. World trade is beginning to emerge out of a trough that bottomed out in July-August and shows signs of stabilising. Inflation has ticked up in some AEs, though well below target, and is easing in several EMEs. Expectations of reflationary fiscal policies in the US, Japan and China, and the waning of downward pressures on EMEs in recession are tempered by still-prevalent political risks in the euro area and the UK, emerging geo-political risks and the spectre of financial market volatility. International financial markets were strongly impacted by the result of the US 9. presidential election and incoming data that raised the probability of the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy. As bouts of volatility fuelled a risk-off surge into US equities and out of fixed income markets, a risk-on stampede pulled out capital flows from EMEs, plunging their currencies and equity markets to recent lows even as bond yields hardened in tandem with US yields. The surge of the US dollar from late October intensified after the election results and triggered sizable depreciations in currencies around the world. Commodity prices firmed up across the board from mid-November on an improvement in the outlook for demand following the US election results, barring gold which lost its safe haven glitter to the ascendant US dollar. Crude prices have firmed after the OPEC\u2019s decision to cut output. 10. On the domestic front, the growth of real gross value added (GVA) in Q2 of 2016-17 turned out to be lower than projected on account of a deeper than expected slowdown in industrial activity. Manufacturing slowed down both sequentially and on an annual basis, with weak demand conditions and the firming up of input costs dragging down the profitability of corporations. Gross fixed capital formation contracted for the third consecutive quarter. Although government final consumption expenditure slowed sequentially, it supported private final consumption expenditure, the mainstay of aggregate demand. The contribution of net exports to aggregate demand remained positive, but on account of a sharper contraction in imports relative to exports. 11. Turning to Q3, the Committee felt that the assessment is clouded by the still unfolding effects of the withdrawal of specified bank notes (SBNs). The steady expansion in acreage under rabi sowing across major crops compared to a year ago should build on the robust performance of agriculture in Q2. By contrast, industrial activity remains weak. Among the core industries in the index of industrial production (IIP), the output of coal contracted in October due to subdued demand, while the production of crude oil and natural gas shrank under the binding constraint of structural impediments. The production of cement, fertilisers and electricity continued to decelerate, reflecting the sluggishness in underlying economic activity. On the other hand, steel output has recorded sustained expansion following the application of countervailing duties. Refinery output accelerated on the back of a pick-up in exports and capacity additions. The withdrawal of SBNs could transiently interrupt some part of industrial activity in November-December due to delays in payments of wages and purchases of inputs, although a fuller assessment is awaited. In the services sector, the outlook is mixed with construction, trade, transport, hotels and communication impacted by temporary SBN effects, while public administration, defence and other services would continue to be buoyed by the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award and one rank one pension (OROP). GVA by financial services is expected to receive a short-term boost from the large inflow of low-cost deposits. 12. Retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) eased more than expected for the third consecutive month in October, driven down by a sharper than anticipated deflation in the prices of vegetables. Underlying this softer reading, however, was an upturn in momentum as prices rose month-on-month across the board. Still elevated prices of sugar and protein-rich items, coupled with a turning up of prices of cereals, pulses and processed foods pushed up the momentum of food prices, which partly offset the moderation in food inflation brought about by a strong favourable base effect. In the fuel category, inflation eased with the decline in LPG prices on an annual basis and a fall in electricity prices from a month ago. Inflation excluding food and fuel continues to show strong persistence. Although housing and personal care inflation softened marginally, the steady rise in inflation in respect of education, medical and health services, and transport and communication has imparted stickiness to inflation in this category. 13. Liquidity conditions have undergone large shifts in Q3 so far. Surplus conditions in October and early November were overwhelmed by the impact of the withdrawal of SBNs from November 9. Currency in circulation plunged by `7.4 trillion up to December 2; consequently, net of replacements, deposits surged into the banking system, leading to a massive increase in its excess reserves. The Reserve Bank scaled up its liquidity operations through variable rate reverse repo auctions of a wide range of tenors from overnight to 91 days, absorbing liquidity (net) of `5.2 trillion. The Reserve Bank allowed oil bonds issued by the Government as eligible securities under the LAF. From the fortnight beginning November 26, an incremental CRR of 100 per cent was applied on the increase in net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between September 16, 2016 and November 11, 2016 as a temporary measure to drain excess liquidity from the system. From November 28, liquidity absorption fell back and the Reserve Bank undertook variable rate repo auctions of `3.3 trillion on November 28. As expected, money market conditions tightened thereafter and the weighted average call rate (WACR) traded near the upper bound of the LAF corridor on that day before dropping back to the policy repo rate on November 30. All other rates in the system firmed up in sympathy, with term premia getting restored gradually. Through this episode, active liquidity management prevented the WACR from falling even to the fixed rate reverse repo rate, the lower bound of the LAF corridor. Liquidity management was bolstered by an increase in the limit on securities under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) from `0.3 trillion to `6 trillion on November 29. There have been three issuances of cash management bills under MSS for `1.4 trillion by December 6, 2016. 14. In the external sector, India\u2019s merchandise exports rebounded in September and October. The return to positive territory was supported by a pick-up in both POL and non-POL exports. After a prolonged fall for 22 months, imports rose in October on the back of a sharp rise in the volume of gold imports and higher payments for POL imports. Non-oil non-gold import growth also turned positive after a gap of seven months. For the period April-October, the merchandise trade deficit was lower by US $ 25 billion from its level a year ago. Accordingly, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted, notwithstanding some loss of remittances and software exports under invisibles. Net foreign direct investment has remained reasonably robust, with more than half going to manufacturing, communication and financial services. By contrast, portfolio investment outflows of the order of US $ 7.3 billion occurred in October-November from both debt and equity markets \u2013 as in peer EMEs across the board \u2013 reflecting a strong home bias triggered by the outcome of the US presidential election and the near-certainty of monetary policy tightening in the US. The level of foreign exchange reserves was US$ 364 billion on December 2, 2016. 15. The Committee took note of the upturn in the prices of several items that is masked by the easing of inflation on base effects during October. Despite some supply disruptions, the abrupt compression of demand in November due to the withdrawal of SBNs could push down the prices of perishables in the reading that becomes available in December. On the other hand, prices of wheat, gram and sugar have been firming up. While discretionary spending on goods and services in the CPI excluding food and fuel \u2013 constituting 16 per cent of the CPI basket \u2013 could have been affected by restricted access to cash, the prices of these items may weather these transitory effects as they are normally revised according to pre-set cycles. Prices of housing, fuel and light, health, transport and communication, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, and education \u2013 together accounting for 38 per cent of the CPI basket \u2013 may remain largely unaffected. Going forward, base effects are expected to reverse and turn unfavourable in December and February. If the usual winter moderation in food prices does not materialise due to the disruptions, food inflation pressures could re-emerge. Furthermore, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has been resistant to downward impulses and could set a floor to headline inflation. With the OPEC\u2019s agreement to cut production, crude prices may firm up in the coming months. Global developments, especially as financial markets factor in the future stance of US monetary and fiscal policy, could impart volatility to the exchange rate thereby feeding into inflation. The withdrawal of SBNs could result in a possible temporary reduction in inflation of the order of 10-15 basis points in Q3. Taking these factors into account, headline inflation is projected at 5 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17 with risks tilted to the upside but lower than in the October policy review. The fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7th CPC award are yet to be assessed, pending implementation, and have not been reckoned in this baseline inflation path (Chart 1). 16. The outlook for GVA growth for 2016-17 has turned uncertain after the unexpected loss of momentum by 50 basis points in Q2 and the effects of the withdrawal of SBNs which are still playing out. Downside risks in the near term could travel through two major channels: (a) short-run disruptions in economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as retail trade, hotels & restaurants and transportation, and in the unorganised sector; (b) aggregate demand compression associated with adverse wealth effects. The impact of the first channel should, however, ebb with the progressive increase in the circulation of new currency notes and greater usage of non-cash based payment instruments in the economy, while the impact of the second channel is likely to be limited. In October 2016, GVA growth in H2 was projected at 7.7 per cent and for the full year at 7.6 per cent. Incorporating the expected loss of growth momentum in Q3 and waning effects in Q4 alongside the boost to consumption demand from higher agricultural output and the implementation of the 7th CPC award, GVA growth for 2016-17 is revised down from 7.6 per cent to 7.1 per cent, with evenly balanced risks (Chart 2). 17. The liquidity management framework was refined in April with the objective of meeting short-term liquidity needs through regular facilities, frictional and seasonal mismatches through fine-tuning operations and more durable liquidity needs for facilitating growth by modulating net foreign assets and net domestic assets. The Reserve Bank has conducted liquidity management consistent with this framework, progressively moving the system level ex ante liquidity conditions to close to neutrality. In Q3 up to early November, liquidity conditions remained in mild surplus mode. The Reserve Bank injected liquidity of `1.1 trillion through OMO purchases during the fiscal year so far, including an OMO purchase auction of `100 billion in October. Although the replacement of SBNs has engendered large surplus liquidity warranting exceptional operations, this needs to be seen as transitory. The Reserve Bank is committed to conducting liquidity operations in pursuit of the objectives of the revised framework put in place in April to restore system level liquidity to a position of neutrality as the surplus liquidity pressures abate. 18. In the view of the Committee, this bi-monthly review is set against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty. Globally, the imminent tightening of monetary policy in the US is triggering bouts of high volatility in financial markets, with the possibility of large spillovers that could have macroeconomic implications for EMEs. In India, while supply disruptions in the backwash of currency replacement may drag down growth this year, it is important to analyse more information and experience before judging their full effects and their persistence \u2013 short-term developments that influence the outlook disproportionately warrant caution with respect to setting the monetary policy stance. If the impact is transient as widely expected, growth should rebound strongly. Turning to inflation, food prices other than vegetables are exhibiting sustained firmness and a pick-up in momentum. Another disconcerting feature of recent developments is the downward inflexibility in inflation excluding food and fuel which could set a resistance level for future downward movements in the headline. Moreover, volatility in crude prices and the surge in financial market turbulence could put the inflation target for Q4 of 2016-17 at some risk. Given these indicators of underlying inflation, it is appropriate to look through the transitory but unclear effects of the withdrawal of SBNs while setting the monetary policy stance. On balance, therefore, it is prudent to wait and watch how these factors play out and impinge upon the outlook. Accordingly, the policy repo rate has been kept on hold in this review, while retaining an accommodative policy stance. 19. Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on December 21, 2016. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on February 7 & 8, 2017 and its resolution will be placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website on February 8, 2017. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent 20. Because of the increased uncertainty due to the withdrawal of SBNs, and virtually no hard data for November, it would be prudent to \u2018wait-and-watch\u2019. 21. While a negative demand shock because of the withdrawal of SBNs will lead to a decline in consumption demand, the risks that such a reduction will have longer term effects by impinging on overall investment sentiment and investment activity are low. The risks that weakening aggregate demand could exacerbate a current type of \u201ccredit cycle\u201d where a weakening of the real economy leads to a reduction in bank profits, leading to credit restrictions which further weaken the real economy, are also low. What counters the adverse effects of the withdrawal of SBNs is the aggressive pace of digitisation, and the fast restoration of the transaction demand for money from the re-tendering process. I therefore expect the demand and supply effects from the withdrawal of SBNs to be transient with the accompanying increase in the output gap likely to be temporary. This makes it inappropriate to respond with a rate cut. 22. My paramount concern at this juncture has to do with the stickiness of inflation excluding food and fuel. While headline inflation declined in October, inflation excluding food and fuel increased to 4.9 per cent in October, and remains sticky despite favourable base effects. It may be that a decline in core only comes after there is a substantial decline in inflationary expectations. Since the last review, there has also been a reversal of the non-food commodity cycle (e.g., metals, oil). Having said this, food inflation declined sharply in October although cereal inflation has been increasing gradually, and pulses and products continue to be major contributors of food inflation. While cereal prices may be constrained by buffer stocks, vegetable inflation is transient in nature, with possible reversals in trend. What is comforting though is that fewer commodities are driving inflation now compared to last month, which means that inflation is less generalised. Some disinflation will also come about because of the withdrawal of SBNs, although with a lag. 23. Despite a 175 basis points cut in the policy rate between January 2015 and November 2016, the reduction in the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on outstanding rupee loans for data up to September 2016 was only 71 basis points. Because of imperfect interest-rate pass through so far, an additional cut at this juncture may not yield any further transmission from banks. 24. Once the union budget is announced in the first week of February, there will be one more data point. Taking into account these considerations, I vote for keeping the policy repo 25. rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent at today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. I also believe that the Committee should now focus on the mid-point of the medium-term inflation target of 4 +/- 2 per cent given the lags associated with the transmission of monetary policy. 26. On the basis of the Indian leading indices produced by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), it can be inferred that the Indian economy was in a resilient state ahead of the decision to withdraw SBNs. It may be noted that a leading index predicts changes in economic activity and thus, cyclical turns in the economy. Specifically, with the Indian Leading Index growth in a clear cyclical upswing and rising to a two-year high before the withdrawal of SBNs, the economic growth outlook going into the autumn months had become increasingly optimistic, underscoring the economy\u2019s resilience to potential negative shocks. Thus, from a business cycle perspective, at the time, the Indian economy was not vulnerable. Moreover, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Exports Index, a harbinger of India's exports growth, was also in a decisive cyclical upturn. This indicates that improved exports growth may provide additional support to growth in economic activity, particularly in the context of the brighter global growth prospects suggested by ECRI\u2019s global leading indices. In this backdrop, the withdrawal of SBNs is expected to have only a transitory impact on economic activity. 27. Moreover, with a cumulative reduction in the policy rate by 175 basis points since January 2015, conditions are conducive for further transmission to lending rates by banks. Meanwhile, in the light of higher international bond yields and a strong upturn in ECRI's U.S. Future Inflation Gauge (that anticipates U.S. inflation), the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise its policy rate this month. 28. Keeping in view the above, I fully endorse the resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent. 29. After carefully considering all arguments for and against holding the policy rate constant in the December review, I find the following reasons convincing for my vote: The Reserve Bank\u2019s forecast of the CPI headline inflation rate obtained by 30. assessment of commodity groups in the CPI basket for the end of March 2017 is about 5 per cent with some upside risks. While my own point forecast based on a more aggregative econometric model is lower, the range estimates of the same indicate a significant chance of the inflation rate exceeding the threshold in March 2017 and in June 2017. 31. Stickiness in the core inflation (other than food and fuel) at close to 5 per cent over the past several months is observed. This coupled with marginally declining but still very high inflationary expectations revealed by the RBI surveys need to be considered seriously. 32. Given the recent developments on SBNs and related policies, the banking sector is likely to be flooded with liquidity for some time to come that on its own may exert a greater influence on the lending rates of banks than the repo rate. Transmission out of the cumulative reduction of 175 basis points in the repo 33. rate since January 2015 has so far been substantially less than 50 per cent in the weighted average lending rate (WALR) for the outstanding Rupee loans and around 60 per cent in the WALR for the fresh rupee loans, whereas it is above 70 per cent in the deposit rates. Thus, there exists enough space for further transmission in the lending rates by the banks. 34. Both external and domestic economic environments are currently impacted by some unique uncertainties as pointed out in the resolution of the Committee. The magnitude of individual and net impact is not very clear at this juncture. In such an environment characterised by uncertainties, any policy intervention in terms of repo rate with acknowledged longer outside lags is likely to add to the uncertainties, which will not be good for the economy. 35. While the recent developments on SBNs can be considered as an exogenous shock to the economy that results in downward revision of the GDP growth forecast, it is widely perceived to be a transitory or temporary phenomenon. If it is so, it is not advisable to respond with a policy intervention that involves longer distributive lags, because otherwise it can destabilise the system or create avoidable uncertainty in policy stance and action in future. 36. As the resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets out, an exceptional configuration of factors is obscuring a clear assessment of the outlook. While domestic supply disruptions and demand compression appear to be transient, global developments, including the morphing of political changes into macroeconomic risks, could likely be longer-lived and more challenging. Under these conditions, precaution warrants careful monitoring of the manner in which these forces play out and influence the near- to medium-term. In particular, it is critical to stay focused on the inflation target of 5 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 amidst subsiding but still-present upside risks in the form of firmness in prices of several food items barring vegetables, hardening international commodity prices \u2013 especially of crude oil \u2013 and the downward inflexibility in inflation excluding food and fuel. Achieving 5 per cent will imbue credibility into the commitment of monetary policy to the inflation target of 4 per cent, i.e., the centre of the target band. Accordingly, I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged, while allowing the transmission of policy rate reductions of 175 basis points effected from January 2015 to maintain accommodation in the monetary policy stance. 37. I fully concur with the assessment set out in the monetary policy resolution of the MPC and vote in favour of no change in the repo rate because of the following reasons: 38. There is uncertainty about the short-term impact of the decision to withdraw the legal tender status of `500 and `1000 denomination bank notes on the macro- economy, although the impact is likely to be transitory. I, however, don\u2019t see any significant downside risks to the medium-term growth prospects of the economy. However, there are other uncertainties as well, especially the oil price situation and geo-political situation. For a forward looking monetary policy framework, given the lags in monetary policy transmission, a policy rate action amidst heightened uncertainty will only implicitly allow short-term developments and expectations to impact the medium-term outlook, which needs to be avoided. 39. In an environment characterised by uncertainty, it is more important to create or reinforce enabling conditions for monetary policy actions to work more effectively, going ahead. Hence, my vote for maintaining the policy rate at current level. Inflation excluding food and fuel remains sticky. International crude oil prices 40. have firmed up. Global financial conditions pose a threat to macroeconomic and financial stability, with large fluctuations in capital flows and asset prices imparting volatility which gets transmitted into inflation. This uncertainty shows no sign of subsiding, and is likely to get accentuated in the coming year as US macroeconomic and trade policies realign. Even as growing credibility in the disinflation process in India has lowered households\u2019 inflation expectations from double digits prevailing until December 2015, they remain elevated and feed into the services component of inflation. More recently, the steady easing of food inflation has brought about a decline in inflation expectations in the latest round of the survey. 41. The impact of the withdrawal of SBNs on growth and inflation, while uncertain, is transitory. Against this backdrop, it is important for monetary policy to stay focused on the medium-term and strive to achieve, on a durable basis, the middle of the notified inflation target range i.e., 4 per cent. There are other risks to this objective. The full cost-push effects of higher allowances under the 7th CPC\u2019s award will impact inflation outcomes and inflation expectations in 2017-19. Also, the implementation of the goods and services tax could produce a one-off step-up, albeit modest, in inflation. The decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production, supported by key non-OPEC members, will harden crude prices further as demand and supply get balanced out. Recent movements in other commodity prices also suggest that the global commodity price cycle could be turning. Inflation in advanced economies is turning up incipiently and is expected to rise significantly in 2017 from 2016 levels. Achieving the inflation target of 5 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 and securing 4 per cent \u2013 the central point of the notified target range \u2013 remains the primary objective. ", "file3": "The fourth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on April 5 and 6, 2017 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; and Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in-charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:\u2013 (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The Committee reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.25 per cent. 6. Consequent upon the narrowing of the LAF corridor as elaborated in the accompanying Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies, the reverse repo rate under the LAF is at 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate are at 6.50 per cent. 7. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 8. Since the MPC met in February 2017, indicators of global growth suggest signs of stronger activity in most advanced economies (AEs) and easing of recessionary conditions in commodity exporting large emerging market economies (EMEs). In the US, high frequency data indicate that the labour market, industrial production and retail sales are catalysing a recovery in Q1 of 2017 from a relatively subdued performance in the preceding quarter. Nonetheless, risks to higher growth have arisen from non-realisation or under-achievement of macroeconomic policies. In the Euro area, the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose to a six- year high in March amidst improving consumer confidence and steadily strengthening employment conditions. In the Japanese economy, nascent signs of revival are evident in the form of falling unemployment, improving business sentiment on fixed investment, and rising exports helped by the depreciation of the yen; however, deflation risks linger. For EMEs, the outlook is gradually improving, with indications that the 9. slowdown characterising 2016 could be bottoming out. In China, supportive macroeconomic policies, surging credit growth and a booming property market have held up the momentum of growth albeit amidst concerns about financial stability and capital outflows. In Brazil, hardening commodity prices are providing tailwinds to reforms undertaken by the authorities to pull the economy out of recession, although financial fragilities remain a risk. Russia is benefiting from the firming up of crude prices and it is widely expected that growth will return to positive territory in 2017. 10. Inflation is edging up in AEs to or above target levels on the back of slowly diminishing slack, tighter labour markets and rising commodity prices. Among EMEs, Turkey and South Africa remain outliers in an otherwise generalised softening of inflation pressures. Global trade volumes are finally showing signs of improvement amidst shifts in terms of trade, with exports rising strongly in several EMEs as well as in some AEs whose currencies have depreciated. 11. International financial markets have been impacted by policy announcements in major AEs, geo-political events and country-specific factors. Equity markets in AEs were driven up by reflation trade, stronger incoming data and currency movements. Equity markets in EMEs had a mixed performance, reflecting domestic factors amidst a cautious return of investor appetite and capital flows. In the second half of March, dovish guidance on US monetary policy lifted equities across jurisdictions, especially in Asia, as the reach for EME assets resumed strongly, although doubts about the realisation of US policies, Brexit and softer crude prices tempered sentiments. Bond markets have mirrored the uncertainty surrounding the commitment to fiscal stimulus in the US and yields traded sideways in AEs, while they generally eased across EMEs. In the currency markets, the US dollar\u2019s bull run lost steam by mid-March. EME currencies initially rose on optimism on the global outlook, but some of them have weakened in recent days with the fall in commodity prices. Crude prices touched a three-month low in March on rising shale output and US inventories. Food prices have been firming up globally, driven by cereals. 12. On the domestic front, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its second advance estimates for 2016-17 on February 28, placing India\u2019s real GVA growth at 6.7 per cent for the year, down from 7 per cent in the first advance estimates released on January 6. Agriculture expanded robustly year-on-year after two consecutive years of sub-one per cent growth. In the industrial sector, there was a significant loss of momentum across all categories, barring electricity generation. The services sector also slowed, pulled down by transport and communication as well as financial, real estate and professional services. Public administration, defence and other services cushioned this slowdown. To some extent, government expenditure made up for weakness in private consumption and capital formation. indicators are pointing 13. Several the macroeconomic outlook. Foodgrains production has touched an all-time high of 272 million tonnes, with record production of rice, wheat and pulses. The record production of wheat should boost procurement operations and economise on imports, which had recently surged. Rice stocks, which had depleted to close to the minimum buffer norm, have picked up with kharif procurement. The bumper production of pulses has helped in building up to the intended buffer stock (i.e., 20 lakh tonnes) and this will keep the price of pulses under check \u2013 the domestic price of pulses has already fallen below the minimum support price (MSP). in Industrial output, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), 14. recovered in January from a contraction in the previous month, helped by a broad- based turnaround in manufacturing as well as mining and quarrying. Capital goods production improved appreciably, although this largely reflected the waning of unfavourable base effects. Consumer non-durables continued, however, to contract for the second successive month in spite of supportive base effects. Thus, investment and rural consumption demand remain muted. The output of core industries moderated in February due to slowdown in production of all the components except coal. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) remained in expansion mode in February and rose to a five month high in March on the back of growth of new orders and output. The future output index also rose strongly on forecasts of pick-up in demand and the launch of new product lines. The 77th round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey indicates that overall business sentiment is expected to improve in Q1 of 2017-18 on the back of a sharp pick up in both domestic and external demand. Coincident indicators such as exports and non-oil non-gold imports are indicative of a brighter outlook for industry, although the sizable under-utilisation of capacity in several industries could operate as a drag on investment. 15. Activity in the services sector appears to be improving as the constraining effects of demonetisation wear off. On the one hand, rural demand remains depressed as reflected in lower sales of two- and three-wheelers and fertiliser. On the other hand, high frequency indicators relating to railway traffic, telephone subscribers, foreign tourist arrivals, passenger car and commercial vehicles are regaining pace, thereby positioning the services sector on a rising trajectory. After three consecutive months of contraction, the services PMI for February and March emerged into the expansion zone on improvement in new business. 16. After moderating continuously over the last six months to a historic low, retail inflation measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price index (CPI) turned up in February to 3.7 per cent. While food prices bottomed out at the preceding month\u2019s level, base effects pushed up inflation in this category. Prices of sugar, fruits, meat, fish, milk and processed foods increased, generating a sizable jump in the momentum in the food group. In the fuel group, inflation increased as the continuous hardening of international prices lifted domestic prices of liquefied petroleum gas during December 2016 \u2013 February 2017. Kerosene prices have also been increasing since July with the programmed reduction of the subsidy. Adapting to the movements in these salient prices, both three months ahead and a year ahead households\u2019 inflation expectations, which had dipped in the December round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, reversed in the latest round. Moreover, the survey reveals hardening of price expectations across product groups. The 77th round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey indicates that pricing power is returning to corporates as profit margins get squeezed by input costs. 17. Excluding food and fuel, inflation moderated in February by 20 basis points to 4.8 per cent, essentially on transient and item-specific factors. In February, favourable base effects were at work in the clothing and bedding sub-group as well as in personal care and effects, the latter also influenced by the disinflation in gold prices. The volatility in crude oil prices and its lagged pass-through are impacting the trajectory of CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Much of the impact of the fall of US $4.5 per barrel in international prices of crude since early February would feed into the CPI print in April as its cumulative pass-through occurred with a lag in the first week of this month. Importantly, inflation excluding food and fuel has exhibited persistence and has been significantly above headline inflation since September 2016. 18. With progressive remonetisation, the surplus liquidity in the banking system declined from a peak of ` 7,956 billion on January 4, 2017 to an average of ` 6,014 billion in February and further down to ` 4,806 billion in March. Currency in circulation expanded steadily during this period. Its impact on the liquidity overhang was, however, partly offset by a significant decline in cash balances of the Government up to mid-March which released liquidity into the system. Thereafter, the build-up of Government cash balances on account of advance tax payments and balance sheet adjustment by banks reduced surplus liquidity to ` 3,141 billion by end-March. Issuances of cash management bills (CMBs) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) ceased in mid-January and existing issues matured, with the consequent release of liquidity being absorbed primarily through variable rate reverse repo auctions of varying tenors. Accordingly, the average net absorption by the Reserve Bank increased from ` 2,002 billion in January to ` 4,483 billion in March. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) remained within the LAF corridor. The maturing of CMBs and reduced issuance of Treasury bills leading up to end-March has also contributed to Treasury bill rates being substantially below the policy rate. 19. Merchandise exports rose strongly in February 2017 from a subdued profile in the preceding months. Growth impulses were broad-based, with major contributors being engineering goods, petroleum products, iron ore, rice and chemicals. The surge in imports in January and February 2017 largely reflected the effect of the hardening of commodity prices such as crude oil and coal. Non-oil non-gold imports continued to grow at a modest pace, though capital goods imports remained sluggish. With imports outpacing exports, the trade deficit widened in January and February from its level a year ago, though it was lower on a cumulative basis for the period April-February 2016-17. 20. Balance of payments data for Q3 indicate that the current account deficit for the first three quarters of the financial year narrowed to 0.7 per cent of GDP, half of its level a year ago. For the year as a whole, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted at less than 1 per cent of GDP. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has dominated net capital inflows during April-December, with manufacturing, communication and financial services being the preferred sectors. Turbulence in global financial markets set off a bout of global risk aversion and flight to safe haven that caused net outflows of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) during November 2016 to January 2017. The tide reversed with the pricing in of the Fed\u2019s normalisation path and improvement in global growth prospects. FPI flows turned positive in February and welled up into a surge in March, especially in debt markets relative to equity markets (which had been the dominant recipient until February). This reversal appears to have been driven by stable domestic inflation, better than expected domestic growth, encouraging corporate earnings, clarity on FPI taxation, pro-reform budget proposals and state election results. The level of foreign exchange reserves was US$ 369.9 billion on March 31, 2017. 21. Since the February bi-monthly monetary policy statement, inflation has been quiescent. Headline CPI inflation is set to undershoot the target of 5.0 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 in view of the sub-4 per cent readings for January and February. For 2017-18, inflation is projected to average 4.5 per cent in the first half of the year and 5 per cent in the second half (Chart 1). 22. Risks are evenly balanced around the inflation trajectory at the current juncture. There are upside risks to the baseline projection. The main one stems from the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the south west monsoon in view of the rising probability of an El Ni\u00f1o event around July-August, and its implications for food inflation. Proactive supply management will play a critical role in staving off pressures on headline the implementation of the allowances recommended by the 7th CPC. In case the increase in house rent allowance as recommended by the 7th CPC is awarded, it will push up the baseline trajectory by an estimated 100-150 basis points over a period of 12-18 months, with this initial statistical impact on the CPI followed up by second-order effects. Another upside risk arises from the one-off effects of the GST. The general government deficit, which is high by international comparison, poses yet another risk for the path of inflation, which is likely to be exacerbated by farm loan waivers. Recent global developments entail a reflation risk which may lift commodity prices further and pass through into domestic inflation. Moreover, geopolitical risks may induce global financial market volatility with attendant spillovers. On the downside, international crude prices have been easing recently and their pass-through to domestic prices of petroleum products should alleviate pressure on headline inflation. from managing inflation. A prominent risk could emanate Also, stepped-up procurement operations in the wake of the record production of foodgrains will rebuild buffer stocks and mitigate food price stress, if it materialises. 23. GVA growth is projected to strengthen to 7.4 per cent in 2017-18 from 6.7 per cent in 2016-17, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). 24. Several favourable domestic factors are expected to drive this acceleration. First, the pace of remonetisation will continue to trigger a rebound in discretionary consumer spending. Activity in cash-intensive retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transportation and unorganised segments has largely been restored. Second, significant improvement in transmission of past policy rate reductions into banks\u2019 lending rates post demonetisation should help encourage both consumption and investment demand of healthy corporations. Third, various proposals in the Union Budget should stimulate capital expenditure, rural demand, and social and physical infrastructure all of which would invigorate economic activity. Fourth, the imminent materialisation of structural reforms in the form of the roll-out of the GST, the institution of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board will boost investor confidence and bring in efficiency gains. Fifth, the upsurge in initial public offerings in the primary capital market augurs well for investment and growth. 25. The global environment is improving, with global output and trade projected by multilateral agencies to gather momentum in 2017. Accordingly, external demand should support domestic growth. Downside risks to the projected growth path stem from the outturn of the south west monsoon; ebbing consumer optimism on the outlook for income, the general economic situation and employment as polled in the March 2017 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey; and, commodity prices, other than crude, hardening further. 26. Overall, the MPC\u2019s considered judgement call to wait out the unravelling of the transitory effects of demonetisation has been broadly borne out. While these effects are still playing out, they are distinctly on the wane and should fade away by the Q4 of 2016-17. While inflation has ticked up in its latest reading, its path through 2017-18 appears uneven and challenged by upside risks and unfavourable base effects towards the second half of the year. Moreover, underlying inflation pressures persist, especially in prices of services. Input cost pressures are gradually bringing back pricing power to enterprises as demand conditions improve. The MPC remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner. Accordingly, inflation developments have to be closely and continuously monitored, with food price pressures kept in check so that inflation expectations can be re-anchored. At the same time, the output gap is gradually closing. Consequently, aggregate demand pressures could build up, with implications for the inflation trajectory. 27. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged in this review while persevering with a neutral stance. The future course of monetary policy will largely depend on incoming data on how macroeconomic conditions are evolving. Banks have reduced lending rates, although further scope for a more complete for small savings/administered rates1. It is in this context that greater clarity about liquidity management is being provided, even as surplus liquidity is being steadily drained out. Along with rebalancing liquidity conditions, it will be the Reserve Bank\u2019s endeavour to put the resolution of banks\u2019 stressed assets on a firm footing and create congenial conditions for bank credit to revive and flow to productive sectors of the economy. remains, 28. Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by April 20, 2017. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on June 6 and 7, 2017. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent Member Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Dr. Urjit R. Patel 30. Core inflation (CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) continues to be sticky, and its persistence poses upside risks for meeting the medium-term inflation target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent. Other exclusion based measures also remain elevated, although there have been transient declines in the demonetisation period. There has also been an inching up in the median 3 month and 1 year ahead inflationary expectations. The recent decline in headline inflation has been driven completely by food inflation and is likely to reverse in the summer months. 31. A strong upside risk to the inflation trajectory is the HRA implementation of the 7th Pay Commission. This needs to be watched carefully in terms of (i) to what extent 1 Since the introduction of the formula in April 2016, interest rates on small savings are about 61-95 basis points higher, depending on tenor, compared to what they should be if the formula is followed. If the spread between small savings rates and bond yields remains wide, the diversion of deposits to small savings would impede a full transmission to bank lending rates. the increase in the centre HRA is matched by state HRAs; and (ii) the extent to which the centre and state HRAs are implemented simultaneously (which means the inflationary effects will be stronger) or is staggered (which means the inflationary effect will be weaker). While we should see through any statistical effects from an increase in the HRA, the size of the second round effects may potentially be large depending on the extent and manner in which the HRA implementation takes place, in which case, there may be a need for a monetary policy response. Our focus on meeting the medium-term inflation target should remain laser sharp in light of such risks. 32. Since the last review, there is more clarity from both \u201csoft\u201d data (based on surveys), and \u201chard\u201d data (based on actual economic performance), that the overall impact of demonetisation on the real economy has been transient. Importantly, the PMI in services has come out of contraction mode. The impact of demonetisation on Rabi sowing has also been very modest and transient \u2013 with a good monsoon and the strategic timing of the MSP helping in this regard. The performance of the real estate sector listed companies has seen an improvement. Large and medium industries have also recovered handsomely in terms of demand after demonetisation, although the small and micro sectors continue to be adversely affected. Overall, the output gap, while marginally negative, is closing gradually leading to the possible building up of inflationary pressures 33. As I mentioned in the last review, the pace of the ending of the re-investment of principal payments by the US Fed from its balance sheet holdings needs to be watched carefully, as also the extent to which such a \u201cbalance sheet reduction\u201d by the Fed, as well as rises in the Fed funds rate, are disruptive for financial markets. Taking into account these considerations, I vote for keeping the policy repo 34. rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent at today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. 35. Several factors indicate positive and modest growth in the economy. The remonetisation drive is progressing well, with the currency in circulation restored to almost 75 per cent of its value by end March of this year, which is expected to support discretionary spending. Spending in cash-intensive activities such as hotels, restaurants, transportation and the unorganised sectors is also on the rise. Further, a decrease in bank lending rates due to a delayed transmission of policy rate reductions in the past augurs well for the economy and may enhance consumption and investment spending. Various measures outlined in the Union Budget 2017-18 are conducive to growth in key sectors including the rural economy, infrastructure and housing, and are expected to have multiplier effects. The March 2017 round of the Industrial Outlook Survey undertaken by the Reserve Bank also shows improvement in sentiment in the corporate sector. On the external front, positive signs of growth across Advanced and Emerging Market Economies may boost demand for Indian exports. This optimism regarding domestic and global economic growth is also reflected in the leading indexes compiled by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York. 36. On the inflation front, CPI inflation remained soft, primarily due to lower food prices, as vegetable prices declined, possibly due to distress sales as a result of demonetisation. However, core inflation (excluding food and fuel) continues to be higher, although it moderated slightly to 4.8 per cent in February. At the same time, upside risks to inflation remain, including remonetisation, rising rural wages, narrowing output gap, implementation of 7th CPC\u2019s higher house rent allowances, rollout of GST, possibility of El Nino conditions, higher global commodity prices, uncertainty regarding prices of crude oil and exchange rate volatility. A Survey of Households Inflation Expectations undertaken by the Reserve Bank in March 2017 also inflation expectations. in 3-month and 1-year ahead Furthermore, ECRI\u2019s Indian Future Inflation Gauge, a harbinger of Indian inflation, indicates some firming in inflation pressures. Statement by Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia 37. The effects of demonetisation on the Indian economy so far have turned out to be transitory and of lower magnitude vindicating our stand earlier. There are indications of a modest improvement in the domestic macroeconomic performance. The global outlook for growth, trade and prices has also improved. It is likely to have a favourable impact on Indian exports and the economy. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) and the Reserve Bank surveys also point to better sentiments on both the domestic and external demand. However, the capacity utilisation in industries has remained persistently low indicating at least continuing, if not widening, output gap. Against this, the headline inflation has been substantially below 4 per cent largely on account of vegetables and pulses. Inflation excluding food and fuel (core inflation) has been fairly sticky though has marginally declined to 4.8 per cent in February. Surplus liquidity in the economy since January 2017 has been steadily declining from ` 8 trillion to ` 4.8 trillion in March 2017. 38. The core inflation according to my calculations is likely to show a declining trend over the year. Moreover, the dynamics of pass-through from the non-core to the core inflation is changing such that volatility in the food/fuel prices would penetrate into core less easily than before. Oil prices according to me are not expected to stay high consistently. Simultaneous implementation of house rent allowances recommended by the 7th CPC by the Centre and all State governments is less likely and consequently its impact on inflation during 2017-18 may not be as high as 1 to 1.5 percentage points. The rising probability of El Nino event around July- August may adversely affect food production but may not seriously impact the food prices in view of comfortable buffer stocks. The GST implementation may not substantially impact the headline inflation because of multi-tier rate system. 39. In view of all this, the inflation projection according to my calculations is an average of around 4 per cent for the first half of 2017-18 and around 4.5 per cent for the second half of the year. Given the surplus liquidity still floating in the system, any change in the policy rate is not desirable at this stage. The liquidity position is expected to return to the normal level consistent with the neutral stance soon. 40. True to projections made at the time of the last meeting of the Committee, inflation is turning up. It seems to me that it is coming out of the U-shaped compression imposed by demonetisation and is now positioned on the rising slope. Several factors merit pre-emptive concern. 41. First, just as it drove a disinflation that started in August \u2013 well before demonetisation, which is responsible only for the sub-4 per cent trough \u2013 it is food that has pushed up headline inflation in February. And it is not the usual suspect \u2013 vegetables. It is the more sinister elements \u2013 protein-rich items other than pulses; cereals; sugar. When inflation rears its ugly head in these items, experience suggests it is likely to stay. 42. Second, inflation excluding food and fuel has been unrelenting. It is only in the February reading that there is a small downward movement, but is it sustainable? I think not: it is item-specific rather than generalised. If staff's projections are indicative, inflation excluding food and fuel will probably run ahead of headline inflation throughout 2017-18. 43. The consequence of the firming up of these salient prices is that inflation expectations have reversed and hardened, and not just in the near term but also a year ahead and across all product groups. Consumer confidence in the price situation has deteriorated. Firms are regaining pricing power. 44. Third, high frequency indicators may be indicating that demonetisation affected actual output rather than potential. With remonetisation, therefore, the output gap may close sooner than expected \u2013 perhaps at a sub-optimal level since there is slack in several industries \u2013 and demand pressures could soon confront the path of inflation in the months ahead. 45. These developments suggest to me that momentum is gathering underneath inflation developments, which appear benign at this juncture. In the second half of 2017-18, favourable base effects fade, and if food inflation rises alongside the stickiness in underlying inflation, it could become a perfect storm. 46. So much for the ingredients of inflation. Let me turn to costs. The most important cost push will emanate from the 7th pay commission's 47. house rent allowance. The first order statistical impact on the CPI may take headline inflation to or beyond the upper tolerance band. Second order effects will work through expectations and \u2018Deusenberry effects\u2019 as it spreads to states, PSUs, universities, and onwards. These effects will occur on top of the first order effect and 6 per cent plus inflation could be here to stay for some time. The second one is the one off effect of the GST - small relative to the 7th pay 48. commission and short lived, it could still last a year and push up inflation. 49. gas; kerosene; the MSP, as usual \u2013 and they will take their toll on headline inflation. Third, several administered price elements are being adjusted upwards \u2013 milk; 50. elephants fight or play, the grass suffers. Finally, let me turn to the elephants in the room, keeping in mind that whether 51. Closest to home is the south west monsoon. The probability of an El Ni\u00f1o event is rising and if food inflation gets entrenched as it did in 2009 in the trail of a sub-normal monsoon, there will be second order effects. 52. market turbulence and the rising tide of protectionism. The second one is imported inflation, including through bouts of financial 53. The third is global inflation \u2013 mercury is rising across advanced economies and it cannot be that India will be immune to it. Normalisation of monetary policy has begun in those economies, and it is not just the raising of policy rates/short-term rates. Normalising overly distended balance sheets can produce tightening of longer rates as well. 54. To sum up, I believe that a pre-emptive 25 basis points increase in the policy rate now will point us better at the target of 4 per cent to which the Committee has committed explicitly. It will also obviate the need for back-loaded policy action later when inflation is unacceptably high and entrenched. On balance, however, I vote for holding the policy rate unchanged in this bi-monthly meeting and await a few more readings of incoming data so that remaining transitory factors have passed and a clearer assessment of domestic and global macroeconomic conditions emerges. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 55. Headline inflation is set to rebound from its recent lows due to the expected (and in the past month, realized) mean-reversion in food inflation, especially in vegetables. Global inflationary trends have remained on the upside too. There is some uncertainty as to when the headline inflation might cross the target inflation rate of 4 per cent and keep inching above, given that inflation without food and fuel is stubbornly above the target rate. We have laid out in the resolution several upside risks, of which geopolitical risks and undoing of the center\u2019s fiscal discipline by the states concern me the most. Commodity prices, especially crude, have been volatile and so has the exchange rate. Hence, risks are evenly balanced around the inflation outlook. 56. On the growth front, the remonetisation is continuing apace and many sectors of the economy are recovering steadily after the transient slowdown. There are signs though that the recovery is somewhat uneven. Private investment, given the high indebtedness of several stressed sectors, remains a particularly weak spot. Household expectations of income, spending and employment appear to have weakened, but may be anchored to the past few months and need to be tracked in the coming months. Other signs of economic activity paint a rosier picture for the growth over the next year, with the external sector having been remarkably resilient. 57. Should an inflation-targeting central bank react to a narrowing output gap in such a scenario? Given the balanced nature of risks and uncertainty that abounds, I lean towards continuing the neutral stance and pause for now. There are many important issues to attend to, notably (i) resolving bank stressed assets and correcting weak bank balance-sheets; (ii) mopping up in a more durable manner the surplus liquidity sloshing around post-demonetisation and which is keeping short- term money market rates away from the policy rate; and (iii) unleashing the true potential of our capital markets further, by enhancing liquidity in the corporate bond market, and improving the ease and the suite of financial hedging options. It seems an opportune time to focus on these issues. 58. After reaching a historic low in January 2017, CPI inflation in February 2017 edged up, as expected. However, in all probability, inflation will significantly undershoot the 5 per cent target set for Q4 of 2016-17. Vegetable prices, which had declined sharply during November 2016 to January 2017, seem to have stabilised but may go up in the coming months due to a seasonal pick up. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained sticky, especially services. Also, given the volatility in the CPI, it is not easy to read its evolution. The outlook for inflation faces several other risks. Input costs have been rising, which could be passed on to output prices as demand strengthens. Further, the implementation of the HRA allowances recommended as part of the 7th CPC and the GST are risks, which could alter the inflation outturn in 2017-18. Uncertainty about the crude oil price trajectory is both ways given recent movements. Heightened geo-political risks continue to impart financial volatility in global markets. The latest data released by the CSO suggested that the impact of 59. demonetisation on economic activity was modest. Economic activity is expected to pick up in 2017-18, although there is the usual uncertainty about the monsoon at this stage. Several lead indicators suggest some improvement in the economic outlook. The industrial outlook survey of the Reserve Bank suggests positive outlook for the manufacturing sector. However, investment activity continues to be weak, but which is unsurprising given the headroom with respect to capacity utilisation in industry (Reserve Bank surveys). 60. Demonetisation induced liquidity facilitated faster monetary transmission. There is still room for banks to cut lending rates. For efficient transmission, it is important that interest rates on small savings are not out of line with interest rates on other comparable instruments in the financial system. 61. Notwithstanding likely favourable base-effects in the next few months, the outlook for inflation calls for close vigilance with a view to ensuring that the medium- term inflation trajectory evolves in line with the objective of bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner. Therefore, I vote for maintaining the status quo in both the policy repo rate, and the stance. ", "file4": "The fifth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on June 6 and 7, 2017 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, 2. Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, 3. the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:\u2013 (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u201f performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The Committee reviewed in detail staff\u201fs macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.25 per cent. 6. and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.50 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 6.0 per cent, 7. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 8. Since the April 2017 meeting of the MPC, global economic activity has expanded at a modest pace, supported by firming growth in major advanced economies (AEs) and in some emerging market economies (EMEs) as well. In the US, a tightening labour market is generating wage gains. Alongside, industrial production has steadily improved in recent months and retail sales remain robust, although home sales ebbed in April. Political risks remain high, however. In the Euro area, the recovery has been underpinned by consistently falling unemployment, rising retail sales and a brighter outlook for manufacturing reflected in purchasing managers\u201f and business surveys. In Japan, exports supported by a depreciated yen and industrial activity are driving an acceleration in growth. Wages and inflation, however, are depressed and holding back domestic demand. Among EMEs, the Chinese economy is stabilising, especially in manufacturing, but financial risks in the form of the credit-fuelled debt overhang could impinge on the outlook. Brazil appears to be emerging out of recession, although growth dynamics remain fragile due to worsening labour market conditions and political turmoil. In Russia, the strengthening global environment is supporting the recovery with improving macro fundamentals. South Africa is grappling with structural constraints which are depressing economic activity. 9. The pick-up in global merchandise trade volume since the start of the year has been sustained in Q2 of 2017, buoyed by strengthening global demand as reflected in rising international air freight and container throughput. Crude prices fell to a five- month low in early May on higher output from Canada and the US, and remain soft, undermining the OPEC\u201fs recent efforts to tighten the market by trimming supply. Among non-fuel commodity prices, metal prices have been retreating on expectations of weak demand from China. Bullion prices remain range-bound, while food prices eased in April but rose in May. These developments suggest that the inflation outlook is still relatively benign for AEs and EMEs alike. 10. International financial markets have been lifted by improving global growth prospects, broadly accommodative monetary policy stances of systemic central banks and generally positive incoming data. Increasingly, financial markets have shown resilience to geo-political events and have swiftly priced them in. This has been reflected in the reinvigoration of the reach for returns. Country-specific factors have modulated investor sentiment. Equity markets in most AEs have gained in Q2, surpassing past peaks in the US; boosted by corporate profits in Japan; and supported by easing political tensions and upbeat data in the case of the Euro area. In EMEs, equities have turned in a mixed performance, with high valuations across Asia, but weaker in Latin America on softer commodity prices. Bond yields in major AEs have been largely range-bound. In EMEs, yields have hardened in the few countries facing inflation pressures and political uncertainties, but for commodity exporters, there has been some recent decline. In the currency markets, the US dollar has weakened in May after dovish guidance by the Fed and unexpected political events. Since mid-May, the yen has shed its depreciating bias and appears to have gained safe haven appeal. EME currencies, which had depreciated on the strength of the US dollar, have steadied more recently on renewal of capital flows and risk-on investor appetite. 11. On May 31, 2017 India\u201fs Central Statistics Office (CSO) released quarterly estimates of national income accounts for Q4 of 2016-17, provisional estimates for 2016-17 and revisions for the preceding five years. The growth of real gross value added (GVA) for 2016-17 has been pegged at 6.6 per cent, 0.1 percentage point lower than the second advance estimates released in February 2017. Underlying the revision is a downward adjustment in services sector growth in Q4 for the constituents of construction, financial and professional services, and real estate. Estimates of agriculture and allied activities have been upgraded to incorporate the all-time high production of foodgrains and horticulture in the year. GVA in industry has also been placed higher in the provisional estimates relative to the earlier reading to reflect the impact of new indices of industrial production (IIP) and wholesale prices (WPI) rebased to 2011-12. The new data reveal that a slowdown in activity in both industry and services set in as early as Q1 of 2016-17 and became pronounced in Q4. Moreover, the deceleration of activity coursing through the year has had underlying drivers that have been in operation since Q2. Components of aggregate demand reflect a contraction in gross fixed investment in Q4, reversing the turnaround evident in the second half of the year in the advance estimates. This is also reflected in the contraction in the production of capital goods in the new IIP. However, private final consumption expenditure recorded robust year-on-year growth. 12. On May 9, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) released its third advance estimates of foodgrains production, which confirmed the record level of output achieved in 2016-17 and, in fact, revised it upwards to 273 million tonnes. The MoA also set out its second advance estimates of fruits and vegetables on May 30, which was also a historical record. Benefiting from the bumper harvest, rabi procurement during Q1 of 2017-18 so far has been significantly higher than a year ago, replenishing food stocks and taking them to 61.9 million tonnes in May 2017, three times the buffer norm. On June 6, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) re- affirmed its forecast of a normal and well-distributed south-west (June-September) monsoon, which augurs well for the agricultural outlook. 13. The new series on the IIP released by the CSO on May 12 improves the coverage of industrial activity, realigns weights and reclassifies sub-sectors to better capture the underlying structural dynamics of the sector, and smoothens the impact of lumpy items on the index. As a result, industrial production expanded by 5.0 per cent during 2016-17 based on the new series (as against 0.7 per cent in the old series). Turning to the current financial year, the output of eight core industries decelerated sharply in April on account of contraction in coal, crude oil and cement due to structural constraints and low demand. Furthermore, electricity generation decelerated due to depressed demand pricing out relatively expensive thermal output. By contrast, the production of steel and fertiliser picked up, the former driven up by exports and the latter by expectations of a normal monsoon. 14. The business expectations index generated by the Reserve Bank\u201fs April round of the Industrial Outlook Survey reflects optimism in the manufacturing sector in Q2 of 2017-18, driven by expectations of rising rural demand, exports and profit margins. On the other hand, the manufacturing purchasing managers\u201f index (PMI) moderated sequentially in May as employment contracted and new orders, both domestic and exports, slowed down. The index, however, remained in the expansion zone and the future output index accelerated for the third month in succession. 15. High frequency real indicators of activity in the services sector point to a mixed performance in April. In the transportation sub-sector, freight carriage by air and rail gathered momentum, and passenger car sales accelerated on the back of sustained strength of urban demand. Sales of commercial vehicles and three-wheelers contracted, however, reflecting in part the effects of new emission norms and technology changes. Two-wheeler sales remained depressed, indicative of still subdued rural demand. In the communication sub-sector, there was a strong growth in the subscriber base of voice and data services. The sustained growth of foreign tourist arrivals and air passenger traffic, both domestic and international, supported activity in the hotels, restaurants and the hospitality sub-sector. Both steel consumption and cement production were, however, sluggish, pointing to continuing weakness in construction activity. The services PMI for May rose to its highest reading since November 2016, with an expansion in new business reflecting improving underlying demand conditions, alongside optimism on employment. 16. Retail inflation measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price index (CPI) plunged to a historic low in April, pulled down by a large favourable base effect which overwhelmed a momentum that was feeble relative to the historical record for the month. Underlying this surprising softness was a sharp fall in food inflation brought about by a deflation in the prices of pulses and vegetables. In addition, moderation in the prices of cereals, eggs, oils and fats and spices contributed to the loss of momentum. In the case of pulses, the large-scale augmentation of supply on account of expansion in acreage, procurement, buffer stocking and imports caused a sharp decline in prices starting in August 2016. Propelled by significantly higher arrivals in mandis relative to the seasonal pattern, prices of vegetables also fell markedly from July and bottomed out in January 2017, with fire sales during the demonetisation period accentuating the fall. The seasonal uptick that typically occurs in the pre-monsoon months has been muted so far. In the fuel group by contrast, inflation surged across the board. Prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene rose in sympathy with international prices even as the subsidy was set on a path of calibrated reduction. Fuel used by rural households rose for the third month in succession, narrowing the wedge between fuel inflation facing rural and urban households. In response to these developments, inflation expectations three months ahead and a year ahead surveyed in the Reserve Bank\u201fs inflation expectations survey of households have ticked down marginally. 17. Excluding food and fuel, inflation dipped 60 basis points from a month ago to 4.4 per cent. The delayed and cumulative downward adjustment of domestic petrol and diesel prices in April to the softening of international crude prices in preceding months was among the factors at work. Inflation in respect of services embedded in transport and communication, education, recreation and health also moderated. The industrial outlook survey and the PMIs for manufacturing and services indicate that pricing power remains weak. 18. Even as surplus liquidity in the banking system post-demonetisation was drained by the ramping up of new currency in circulation by \u20b9 1.5 trillion in April and May, massive spending by the Government re-injected liquidity into the system, raising the daily average overall surplus liquidity in the banking system to \u20b9 4.2 trillion in April and \u20b9 3.5 trillion in May. Unwinding of the excess reserves that banks used to dress up balance sheets for end-March also resulted in an accretion of \u20b9 0.8 trillion to the surplus liquidity. Absorption operations undertaken by the Reserve Bank in the context of these developments and the consequent downward pressure on money market rates consisted of \u20b9 1 trillion impounded through issuance of treasury bills (TBs) of tenors ranging from 312 days to 329 days under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS), auctions of cash management bills (CMBs) of \u20b9 0.7 trillion triggered by the decline in cash balances of the Government, and variable rate reverse repo auctions of different tenors which took in the remaining surplus liquidity averaging \u20b9 3.8 trillion in April and \u20b9 3.4 trillion in May. With the narrowing of the LAF corridor from +/- 50 bps to +/- 25 bps in April 2017, these operations ensured that the weighted average call money rate (WACR) \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy\u2013 broadly traded within the corridor. The spread between the WACR and the policy repo rate narrowed from 29-32 basis points (bps) in March-April to 21 bps in May. 19. Merchandise exports posted double digit growth in March and April 2017 in an environment of slowly improving global trade, with 80 per cent of this expansion contributed by engineering goods, petroleum products, gems and jewellery, readymade garments and chemicals. Merchandise imports also increased sharply, propelled by domestic demand, with the jump of 47.2 per cent in US dollar terms not recorded since 2011. Imports of petroleum and products rose strongly on price effects as international crude prices firmed up in the wake of OPEC\u201fs productions cut. Gold imports also surged in volume terms, initially driven by seasonal and festival demand but subsequently by stockpiling in anticipation of the roll out of the goods and services tax (GST). Non-oil non-gold imports contributed about half of the total import growth in March and April, reflecting higher recourse to electronic goods, pearls and precious stones, coal, machinery and machine tools from overseas markets. With import growth significantly outpacing export growth, the trade deficit increased sizably. The current account deficit (CAD) for the year 2016-17 is likely to remain within 1 per cent of GDP. Unlike in the immediately preceding quarter, capital flows in April-May 2017 were dominated by foreign portfolio investment (FPI), pushed out by risk-on investor sentiment as global growth prospects improved. Also, clarity emerged on taxation issues in the Union Budget and the expectations of faster structural reforms were fuelled by the decisive outcome of State elections. The level of foreign exchange reserves as on June 2, 2017 was US$ 381.2 billion. Outlook 20. The abrupt and significant retreat of inflation in April from the firming trajectory that was developing in February and March has raised several issues that have to be factored into the inflation projections. First, it needs to be assessed as to whether or not the unusually low momentum in the reading for April will endure. Second, the prices of pulses are clearly reeling under the impact of a supply glut caused by record output and imports. Policy interventions, including access to open trade, may be envisaged to arrest the slump in prices. Third, the accumulated downward adjustment in the prices of petrol and diesel effected in April has been largely reversed on June 1. Fourth, the easing of inflation excluding food and fuel may be transient in view of its underlying stickiness in a situation of rising rural wage growth and strong consumption demand. Thus, the April reading has imparted considerable uncertainty to the evolving inflation trajectory, especially for the near months. If the configurations evident in April are sustained, then absent policy interventions, headline inflation is projected in the range of 2.0-3.5 per cent in the first half of the year and 3.5-4.5 per cent in the second half (Chart 1). Risks are evenly balanced, although the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon and the government staying the course in effective food management will play a critical role in the evolution of risks. The risk of fiscal slippages, which, by and large, can entail inflationary spillovers, has risen with the announcements of large farm loan waivers. At the current juncture, global political and financial risks materialising into imported inflation and the disbursement of allowances under the 7th central pay commission\u201fs award are upside risks. The date of implementation of the latter is still not announced and as such, it is not factored into the baseline projections. The implementation of the GST is not expected to have a material impact on overall inflation. 21. With the CSO\u201fs provisional estimates for 2016-17, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 has accordingly been revised 10 bps downwards from the April 2017 projection to 7.3 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). The continuing remonetisation should enable a pick-up in discretionary consumer spending, especially in cash-intensive segments of the economy. Furthermore, the reductions in banks\u201f lending rates post-demonetisation should support both consumption and investment demand of households and stress-free corporates. Moreover, Government spending continues to be robust, cushioning the impact of a slowdown in other constituents. The implementation of proposals in the Union Budget should crowd in private investment as the business environment improves with structural reforms, including the GST, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. Strengthening external demand will likely play a more decisive role in supporting the domestic economy. In addition, the new IIP broadens the recognition of industrial activity. On the downside, global political risks remain elevated and could materialise. Second, rising input costs and wage pressures may prove a drag on the profitability of firms, pulling down overall GVA growth. Third, the twin balance sheet problem - over-leveraged corporate sector and stressed banking sector - may delay the revival in private investment demand. 22. The MPC noted that incoming data suggest that the transitory effects of demonetisation have lingered on in price formations relating to salient food items, entangled with excess supply conditions with respect to fruits and vegetables, pulses and cereals. At the same time, however, the CSO\u201fs latest releases on national income accounts and industrial production attest to the effects of demonetisation on the broader economy being sector specific and transient, as well as to the noteworthy resilience of private consumption. At this stage, it is difficult to isolate these factors or to judge the strength of their persistence. As the year progresses, underlying inflation pressures, especially input costs, wages and imported inflation, will have to be closely and continuously monitored. 23. Noting that inflation has fallen below 4 per cent only since November 2016, the MPC remains focused on its commitment to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis keeping in mind the output gap. The current state of the economy underscores the need to revive private investment, restore banking sector health and remove infrastructural bottlenecks. Monetary policy can play a more effective role only when these factors are in place. Premature action at this stage risks disruptive policy reversals later and the loss of credibility. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged with a neutral stance and remain watchful of incoming data. 24. The Reserve Bank will continue to work in partnership with the government to address the stress in banks\u201f balance sheets. Better alignment of administered interest rates on small savings with market rates and stepped-up recapitalisation of banks to facilitate adequate flow of credit to productive sectors are important steps to follow through. Five members were in favour of the monetary policy decision, while Dr. 25. Ravindra H. Dholakia was not in favour. The minutes of the MPC\u201fs meeting will be published by June 21, 2017. 26. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on August 1 and 2, 2017. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent Member Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr.Pami Dua Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Dr.Urjit R. Patel 27. The sharp decline in headline inflation in April was surprising. It should, however, be noted that while headline inflation in April 2017 was 3 per cent, net of vegetables and pulses it was 4.3 per cent. More importantly, it is highly unlikely that a single data point of 3 per cent for April 2017 is the harbinger of 4 per cent for the durable future. 28. I have consistently highlighted the risk that the persistence of CPI inflation excluding food and fuel poses to meeting the medium-term headline inflation target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent. To that extent, the significant decline in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel in April 2017 (from approximately 5 per cent to 4.4 per cent) is comforting and is indicative of a general moderation in demand-pull pressures in the economy. This outcome is possibly consistent with a further widening of the output gap induced in part by demonetisation. There has also been an inching down in the median 3-month and 1-year ahead inflation expectations which is also comforting. I, however, would like to see the reduction in CPI excluding food and fuel on a more durable basis. The slowdown in growth in Q4 FY17 based on the latest CSO figures is 29. suggestive of some adverse effects of demonetisation and that these effects may have widened the output gap. As I mentioned in my previous statement, however, these effects are likely to be transient, and therefore do not warrant a monetary policy response. For instance, private final consumption expenditure, the largest component of final expenditure, has remained robust, despite demonetisation. More clarity is required on the new CSO data on a number of fronts. For instance, the lower growth numbers for Q4 FY17 not being in line with several high frequency indictors for this period is puzzling. The new CSO data has too many moving parts at this juncture to provide a definitive picture on output and growth trends post- demonetisation. 30. At this juncture, it would be prudent to wait and watch to see (i) whether headline inflation durably evolves in line with the medium-term inflation target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent; and (ii) how other risks (fiscal risks in terms of state farm loan waivers, GST, HRA, the monsoon) impinge on the medium term target. I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent at today\u201fs 31. meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Inflation softened considerably with CPI inflation falling to 2.99 per cent in 32. April, 2017 owing to a favourable base effect, moderation in prices of several food items, and deflation in prices of pulses and vegetables. Although prices of food remained subdued during the pre-seasonal months, core inflation stood at 4.4 per cent and continues to remain sticky. The monsoon is likely to be normal and may help to sustain the low food inflation trajectory. At the same time, upside risks include the prospect of rising rural wage growth, the resulting boost in consumption demand, fiscal slippages in the form of farm loan waivers and a possibility of disbursement of allowances under the 7th central pay commission\u201fs award. 33. While growth in Gross Value Added at 2011-12 prices (provisional estimate) slowed down in the last quarter of 2016-17, several other factors, apart from remonetisation, indicate positive growth during 2017-18. Various reforms including GST, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board are expected to improve sentiments of domestic as well as international investors. The expected pickup in economic activity is endorsed by the RBI\u201fs 77th round 34. of Industrial Outlook Survey which demonstrates much improved sentiment on account of anticipated growth in order books, decline in pending orders and improved outlook of the overall business situation. Moreover, the Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by the RBI suggests that the one-year outlook on general economic situation, employment scenario and household income has improved. 35. The downside risks to growth include an uncertain geo-political environment in several of India\u201fs trade partners. Furthermore, while there is excess liquidity in the banking system and several banks have cut rates post demonetisation, stressed assets on bank balance sheets may preclude recovery of private investment. There is also a strong likelihood that the US Federal Reserve may increase interest rates later this month, given the earlier cyclical upturn in the US Future Inflation Gauge maintained by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, along with the strength in ECRI\u201fs leading indexes of US economic growth. Meanwhile, growth in ECRI\u201fs Indian Leading Exports Index recently hit a multiyear high, indicating a still- favourable export outlook. In view of the mixed risks to inflation and growth, it may be best to adopt a wait 36. and watch policy as new data flows in. 37. There are several noteworthy developments recently on prices and output fronts that warrant a decisive policy action by the MPC. In my opinion, this is the most opportune time for the MPC to effect a major cut of 50 basis points in the policy rate to bring it down from 6.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent. My reasons for this recommendation are the following: 38. After the MPC meeting of April 2017, the two monthly readings of the CPI- combined inflation turned out to be more consistent with my forecast stated in the Minutes of the previous meeting than of the RBI forecast. The core inflation figures also vindicated my view about a clear declining trend rather than stickiness as predicted in the RBI forecast. Now the RBI has also revised their forecast of CPI- headline inflation downward to 2 - 3.5 per cent during the first half; and 3.5 - 4.5 per cent during the second half of 2017-18. Though my forecasts now are lower than RBI\u201fs by about 40 and 90 basis points respectively from the RBI\u201fs upper bounds, the essential point is that the expected headline CPI inflation over the next 12 months is expected to ease by at least 50 basis points compared to the April meeting of the MPC. 39. The 3-months and 12-months advance inflationary expectations as per the RBI survey of households are unambiguously declining and are among the lowest levels observed in the history of such surveys. 40. On the other hand, capacity utilization has persistently remained below 75 per cent now for a long time indicating existence of a large output gap. Although precise measurement of the output gap is highly controversial particularly for a rapidly developing country like India, there cannot be disagreement on the Indian economy significantly under-performing compared to its potential now for quite some time. Moreover, recent policy reforms in the country would certainly lead to the increased potential output and growth in the economy implying persistent if not widening output gap in the near to medium term. If any unanticipated inflationary pressures arise in future, they are likely to be substantially subdued by the presence of the high output gap. 41. Given the change in the outlook and assessment of the inflation and output over time, any theoretical rule-based policy for flexible inflation targeting would not only justify but also necessitate at least 50 basis point cut in the policy rate. This is because, if we are consistent, we must consider changes in the values of the critical parameters during the period since the last meeting of the MPC. Even under the most conservative estimates of the multipliers indicating the assumed sacrifice ratio, a minimum of 50 basis point cut in the policy rate is suggested. If we consider more realistic estimates of the sacrifice ratio for India, the policy rate cut could be even higher. The monsoon forecasts released on 6th June, 2017 have created optimism for 42. the second consecutive good year for agricultural production since the rainfall is expected to be higher at 98 per cent than 96 per cent of the long term average and would be geographically well distributed. Thus, the momentum pick up in agricultural inflation during the next 12 months is substantially less probable with obvious favorable impact on the headline CPI inflation. 43. International developments on oil price front are again not posing major threats. In my opinion, oil prices are likely to remain within the narrow range observed in recent times. Any breach on either side may not last for a longer time. I would not consider any major upside risk to the domestic headline inflation on this count. 44. Stable or appreciating exchange rate provides enough incentives for the FII and FDI particularly when there is a high degree of political stability; and when the observed Indian growth rate of output is among the highest in the world. US Fed rate hike is already factored in by the markets and no surprises are expected on its count. The 7th CPC recommendations on HRA can at best be implemented by the 45. Centre and only a few states during the year 2017-18. The impact assessment on the headline CPI inflation of about 150 basis points by the RBI is highly overstated because the recommended HRA by the 7th CPC in the Centre and ALL states almost immediately. The impact of its implementation only by the Centre would be about 36 basis points over a six months period and about 106 basis points over a six months period if ALL states implement the recommendations together given the sampling design and methodology of estimating CPI-combined. In all probability, the impact on this count on the headline CPI inflation during 2017-18 would not be more than 50 basis points. On the other hand, it is most likely to be more than off-set by the implementation of GST in its present form. 44.

On the other hand, it is most likely to be more than off-set by the implementation of GST in its present form. There are concerns about the recent farm loan waivers announced by a 46. couple of states. It is feared that it can lead to fiscal profligacy by other states too and result in significant increase in the fiscal deficits by the states jeopardizing the fiscal discipline and prudent levels of debt by states. In this context, we must note that states are bound by their own Fiscal Responsibility Legislations (FRLs) and that every state has it in place. So far, states have been behaving very responsibly and have collectively reduced their fiscal deficits and debt consistently. Now for quite some time, they have been borrowing directly from the market and their fiscal performance has a direct bearing on their interest costs. As a result, it is not justifiable to assume that loan waivers would directly and proportionately result in increasing their fiscal deficits. Actually, during 2017-18, they have budgeted to reduce their combined fiscal deficit by 70 basis points. The other possibilities for the states are that they may get more revenues from the implementation of GST (which are not budgeted by them) and/or that they may reallocate some of their expenditures to accommodate the loan waivers. So long as the aggregate fiscal deficit of the states does not increase, its inflationary impacts are not going to be felt. Moreover, not all states are likely to follow the suit and certainly not during the same year. Even if we consider that the loan waivers are granted immediately and they result in the increased fiscal deficit, their impact on the inflation would occur only with a considerable time-lag. Hence, these inflation risks, if at all, are in distant future and under normal circumstances are not very probable. It is altogether a different issue whether the loan waivers by some states is the least distorting and inflation impacting option among the alternatives available to address the problem. It need not be a concern for the MPC. 47. GST implementation is most likely to create demand for the working capital credit from the banking sector. Similarly, the corporate bond market needs to be given a boost. 48. All in all, the prevailing inflation and output conditions and prospects are such that there is enough space for a substantial rate cut of 50 basis points if not more. The risk factors appear to be highly mitigated and the probability of circumstances developing to reverse the decision is very low if not non-existent. Under such circumstances, becoming cautious and not acting amounts to ignoring all costs associated with not supporting growth in terms of unemployment and poverty reduction. Becoming too overcautious under such circumstances is against the principle of prudence. In fact, prudence lies in creating space when conditions are favorable and risks are not high than waiting and losing the opportunity. In case, the conditions were really to turn unfavorable in future, the costs to the society would be severe if during the right time expansionary policies are not followed. I, therefore, strongly plead to the MPC to effect a 50 basis points cut in the policy rate without losing any time. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 49. An inflation targeting framework is inherently forward-looking. The focus has to be on steering the trajectory of inflation towards its target over the medium-term and dealing with the risks around it, not on conducting monetary policy by looking at the rear-view mirror (the most recent inflation prints) or deviations of recent outcomes from projections (\u201eforecast errors\u201f) that cannot be presumed to be durable. 50. It is hard to believe that deflation of 15.9 per cent in the prices of pulses and 8.6 per cent in the prices of vegetables is the steady state that will define the medium-term food inflation path. Not when agricultural wages have risen by 8.5 per cent, farm input costs by 10 per cent, bank credit to agriculture by 13.5 per cent in the year just gone by and the output gap in agriculture is turning positive on rising rural incomes! As regards fuel, the wedge in fuel inflation between urban and rural households has closed at an elevated level. Inflation excluding food and fuel has turned down in three readings now, but it is still not generalized and projections still run ahead of headline inflation in the rest of 2017-18. 51. Turning to cyclical factors, households seem to be discounting the near-term and consequently, they expect inflation to rise faster a year ahead than in the next three months. Moreover, an output gap calculated on data for 2016-17 that profile a slowdown will, by definition, be negative and wider than otherwise. For an economy that is projected to grow at 7.3 per cent in 2017-18, however, it must be the case that the output gap would narrow and close. Meanwhile, the MPC has highlighted elements to look out for: the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon; fiscal 52. In the revised inflation trajectory for the first half of 2017-18, the near term inflation outlook is admittedly benign. Yet, in a situation in which transitory and structural factors are meshed and difficult to decouple, apparently divergent messages emanate from the few data points that are available at this stage. Without more clarity, it is possible to make policy errors that can be large and costly in the medium-term. Accordingly, I vote to wait and watch the incoming data while retaining the flexibility of a neutral stance. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 53. The softness of April inflation prints, in food, and excluding food and fuel, as well as of the CSO's revised estimates of growth for 2016-17, especially Q4, has posed difficult challenges for monetary policy. Our inflation forecasts relied on evidence of gradual reversal after fire sales in several food items, which were partly confirmed by February and March reversion, as well as on the seasonal uptick in food prices during summer. Realized food inflation, however, turned out to be much lower than our forecast. Inflation excluding food and fuel also moderated. The global and goods-and-services tax (GST) related risks, that we have been concerned about, haven't materialized. One needs to wait for some more time to ascertain whether our capital inflows and exchange rate remain relatively immune to the Federal Reserve\u201fs unwinding of its asset purchase program; we might see a pick-up in imported inflation otherwise. Similarly, a few more months\u201f data will confirm if the GST rollout is likely to be entirely benign for inflation. It is the collapse of food inflation, however, that remains the primary driver of a steady decline in the headline number. It is clear now that supply factors, in addition to transitory effects, have been playing a significant role for at least three quarters with no sign yet of abating. The growth slowdown has had 54. the continuing decline in private investment since the beginning of 2016-17; and second, the more recent fall in construction activity that is also evidenced in the poor performance of cement industry and real estate services. two primary components: one, 55. Have we managed food inflation to a stable level so that the medium-term headline inflation path will remain firmly anchored below 4 per cent? While the continuing food disinflation due to supply-side measures in some high-weight food items would suggest so, farmer demands one is witnessing with each passing day gives me a pause. I remain concerned though that this may have sown the seeds of a \"tail risk\" in the form of fiscally expansive measures that could spark off generalized inflation in due course. 56. The growth slowdown in Q4 has finally led to the outcome that our estimates of \u201coutput gap\", in spite of substantial uncertainty around such estimates, point to the opening up of a negative gap. In the traditional ways of thinking about monetary policy, this would push the interest rate policy towards being more willing to accommodate. I prefer to approach monetary policy through the finance angle where the focus is on effectiveness of the transmission policy: Will the interest rate changes have the desired amplifier effects on the economy through the bank and non-bank intermediation sector? On this front, we have a problem. A substantial part of the banking sector balance-sheet remains exposed to heavily indebted sectors, a stress that has built up over at least six to seven years. Accommodation in monetary policy during 2015-16 did not get transmitted to the corporate sector, and private investment remained weak then in spite of the monetary stance. The Treasury gains accruing to banks in this time, while not a direct concern for the monetary policy, only masked the true stress of their balance-sheets. In such a scenario, the standard prescription for monetary policy does not 57. necessarily work well. Tolerance for a slightly higher real rate of interest is justified to ensure weak banks do not find relatively low the hurdle rate for ever-greening (perennial extension) of bad loans. What is required for monetary policy to do its job better is to address the stress on bank (and highly-indebted borrower) balance- sheets. The Reserve Bank's efforts on this will start in the earnest in a few weeks. Once the transmission mechanism is restored to better health, monetary policy will more pervasively touch different parts of the economy. Targeted interventions to stimulate demand for sectors such as construction, where the supply is likely affected as an intended consequence of recent policies, would be more effective for now; this would not run the risks of ever-greening, given the relatively low delinquency rates in bank lending in these segments. 58. These considerations prevented me from considering a change in stance or recommending a rate cut based on available data, just before the Federal Reserve rate hike and before we had firmly put in place our efforts on resolution of banking sector stress. I will watch next few months of inflation and real economic activity indicators closely to confirm if lower-than-target headline inflation and negative output gap are persistent. 59. Finally, I wish to clarify one point. Some suggest that monetary policy should be eased with the explicit objective of recapitalizing the weak bank balance-sheets. Nothing could be worse for monetary policy, in my view. This would relax the pressure on good efforts that are underway deploying a slew of measures to improve the banking architecture (through private capital-raising, non-core asset sales, turn, consolidation, divestment and this would trap the monetary policy from changing its direction if data so demand before the resolution of banks is complete. It is best for sake of policy credibility to not mix instruments with objectives they are not meant to target. Statement by Dr. Urjit R. Patel 60. Considering the high uncertainty clouding the near-term inflation outlook, there is a need to avoid premature policy action at this stage. I, therefore, vote for holding the policy repo rate at the current level of 6.25 per cent and maintaining the neutral stance of monetary policy. 61. The sharp disinflation in April 2017, coming on the back of firming of inflation in February and March, has imparted considerable uncertainty to the near-term inflation outlook. Food inflation fell sharply, driven by unusually low momentum in food prices combined with favourable base effects. Disinflation in services also resulted in moderation in CPI, excluding food and fuel inflation, which had remained sticky through most part of 2016-17. Incoming data is expected to provide greater clarity on the durability of recent food and non-food disinflation. There is also a need to be alert to elements that may have a significant influence on the inflation outcome over the medium-term. Firstly, inflation expectations of households remain elevated despite some recent moderation. Second, the implementation of 7th CPC HRA award is an upside risk. Third, some increase in MSPs is inevitable. Last, the rising fiscal risks due to growing demand for farm loan waivers also pose a risk to inflation. In this context, it may be instructive to note that the outstanding advances to agriculture & allied activities as ratio to GDP from agriculture & allied activities has increased from about 13 percent in 2000-01 to around 53 per cent at present; average annual nominal growth rate in Scheduled Commercial Banks' advances to agriculture & allied activities was 21.5 per cent during 2000-01 to 2016-17. 62. GVA growth weakened in Q4 of 2016-17 due mainly to slowdown in the services sector growth. On the demand side, while growth in private consumption expenditure was robust despite demonetisation, gross fixed investment contracted in Q4. Going forward, it is comforting that the India Meteorological Department has reiterated its forecast of a normal south-west monsoon. This bodes well for the agriculture sector and rural spending. The business expectation index of the latest round of the Reserve Bank\u201fs Industrial Outlook Survey points to optimism. Overall, growth is expected to recover gradually in 2017-18. We have to be mindful of pitfalls in assessing the overall (national) output gap. For sub-sectors such as infrastructure (especially public transportation, railways etc.) that enter the aggregate (national) production process in \u201cfixed\u201d (Leontieff) coefficients, the \u201cgap\u201d may be positive, thereby further growth acceleration, as well as undermining competitiveness. The quiescent investment cycle remains a key macroeconomic concern. It is, 63. therefore, imperative to ensure resolution of stressed assets of banks and timely recapitalisation of PSBs. While the transmission of past policy rate cuts continues \u2013 with some banks further reducing the deposit and lending rates \u2013 aligning administered interest rates on small savings to the committed formula can further strengthen the monetary transmission. ", "file5": "The seventh meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on October 3 and 4, 2017 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:\u2013 (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting in August 2017, global economic activity has strengthened further and become broad-based. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US has continued to expand with revised Q2 GDP growing at its strongest pace in more than two years, supported by robust consumer spending and business fixed investment. Recent hurricanes could, however, weigh on economic activity in the near-term. In the Euro area, the economic recovery gained further traction and spread, underpinned by domestic demand. While private consumption benefited from employment gains, investment rose on the back of favourable financing conditions. The Euro area purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for manufacturing soared to its highest reading in more than six years. The Japanese economy continued on a path of healthy expansion despite a downward revision in growth since March 2017 on weaker than expected capital expenditure. 7. Among the major emerging market economies (EMEs), strong growth in Q2 in China was powered by retail sales, and imports grew at a rapid pace, suggesting robust domestic demand; investment activity, however, slowed down. The Brazilian economy expanded for two consecutive quarters in Q2 on improving terms of trade, even as the impact of recession persists on the labour market. Economic activity in Russia recovered further, supported by strengthening global demand, firming up of oil prices and accommodative monetary policy. Although South Africa has emerged out of recession in Q2, the economy faces economic and political challenges. 8. The latest assessment by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) indicates a significant improvement in global trade in 2017 over the lacklustre growth in 2016, backed by a resurgence of Asian trade flows and rising imports by North America. Crude oil prices hit a two-year high in September on account of the combined effect of a pick-up in demand, tightening supplies due to production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and declining crude oil inventories in the US. Metal prices have eased since mid-September on weaker than expected Chinese industrial production data. Bullion prices touched a year\u2019s high in early September on account of safe-haven demand due to geo-political tensions, before weakening somewhat in the second half. Weak non-oil commodity prices and low wage growth kept inflation pressures low in most AEs and subdued in several EMEs, largely reflecting country-specific factors. 9. Global financial markets have been driven mainly by the changing course of monetary policy in AEs, generally improving economic prospects and oscillating geo- political factors. Equity markets in most AEs have continued to rise. In EMEs, equities generally gained on improved global risk appetite, supported by upbeat economic data and expectations of a slower pace of monetary tightening in major AEs. While bond yields in major AEs moved sideways, they showed wider variation in EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar weakened further and fell to a multi-month low in September on weak inflation, though it recovered some lost ground in the last week of September on a hawkish US Fed stance and tensions around North Korea. The euro surged to a two and a half year high against the US dollar towards end-August on positive economic data, whereas the Japanese yen experienced sporadic bouts of volatility triggered by geo-political risks. Emerging market currencies showed divergent movements and remained highly sensitive to monetary policies of key AEs. Capital flows to EMEs have continued, but appear increasingly vulnerable to the normalisation of monetary policy by the US Fed. 10. On the domestic front, real gross value added (GVA) growth slowed significantly in Q1 of 2017-18, cushioned partly by the extensive front-loading of expenditure by the central government. GVA growth in agriculture and allied activities slackened quarter-on-quarter in the usual first quarter moderation, partly reflecting deceleration in the growth of livestock products, forestry and fisheries. Industrial sector GVA growth fell sequentially as well as on a y-o-y basis. The manufacturing sector \u2013 the dominant component of industrial GVA \u2013 grew by 1.2 per cent, the lowest in the last 20 quarters. The mining sector, which showed signs of improvement in the second half of 2016-17, entered into contraction mode again in Q1 of 2017-18, on account of a decline in coal production and subdued crude oil production. Services sector performance, however, improved markedly, supported mainly by trade, hotels, transport and communication, which bounced back after a persistent slowdown throughout 2016-17. Construction picked up pace after contracting in Q4 of 2016-17. Financial, real estate and professional services turned around from their lacklustre performance in the second half of 2016-17. Of the constituents of aggregate demand, growth in private consumption expenditure was at a six-quarter low in Q1 of 2017-18. Gross fixed capital formation exhibited a modest recovery in Q1 in contrast to a contraction in the preceding quarter. Turning to Q2, the south-west monsoon, which arrived early and progressed 11. well till the first week of July, lost momentum from mid-July to August \u2013 the crucial period for kharif sowing. By end-September, the cumulative rainfall was deficient by around 5 per cent relative to the long period average, with 17 per cent of the geographical area of the country receiving deficient rainfall. The live storage in reservoirs fell to 66 per cent of the full capacity as compared with 74 per cent a year ago. The uneven spatial distribution of the monsoon was reflected in the first advance estimates of kharif production by the Ministry of Agriculture, which were below the level of the previous year due to lower area sown under major crops including rice, coarse cereals, pulses, oilseeds, jute and mesta. 12. The index of industrial production (IIP) recovered marginally in July 2017 from the contraction in June on the back of a recovery in mining, quarrying and electricity generation. However, manufacturing remained weak. In terms of the use-based classification, contraction in capital goods, intermediate goods and consumer durables pulled down overall IIP growth. In August, however, the output of core industries posted robust growth on the back of an uptick in coal production and electricity generation. The manufacturing PMI moved into expansion zone in August and September 2017 on the strength of new orders. 13. On the services side, the picture remained mixed. Many indicators pointed to improved performance even as the services PMI continued in the contraction zone in August due to low new orders. In the construction segment, steel consumption was robust. In the transportation sector, sales of commercial and passenger vehicles as well as two and three-wheelers, railway freight traffic and international air passenger traffic showed significant upticks. However, cement production, cargo handled at major ports, domestic air freight and passenger traffic showed weak performance. 14. Retail inflation measured by year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI) edged up sequentially in July and August to reach a five month high, due entirely to a sharp pick up in momentum as the favourable base effect tapered off in July and disappeared in August. After a decline in prices in June, food inflation rebounded in the following two months, driven mainly by a sharp rise in vegetable prices, along with the rise in inflation in prepared meals and fruits. Cereals inflation remained benign, while deflation in pulses continued for the ninth successive month. Fuel group inflation remained broadly unchanged in August even as inflation in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, firewood and chips rose. Petroleum product prices tracked the hardening of international crude oil prices. 15. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel also increased sharply in July and further in August, reversing from its trough in June 2017. The increase was broad-based in both goods and services. Housing inflation hardened further in August on account of higher house rent allowances for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission award. Inflation in household goods and services in health, recreation and clothing & footwear sub-groups increased. Quantitative inflation expectations of households eased in the September 2017 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey. However, in terms of qualitative responses, the proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate rose markedly for the three-month as well as one-year ahead horizons. Farm and industry input costs picked up in August. Real wages in the rural and organised sectors continued to edge up. The Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey showed that corporate pricing power for the manufacturing sector remained weak. In contrast, firms polled for the services sector PMI reported a sharp rise in prices charged. 16. Surplus liquidity in the system persisted through Q2 even as the build-up in government cash balances since mid-September 2017 due to advance tax outflows reduced the size of the surplus liquidity significantly in the second half of the month. Currency in circulation increased at a moderate pace during Q2, by ` 569 billion as against ` 1,964 billion during Q1, reflecting the usual seasonality. Consistent with the guidance given in April 2017 on liquidity, the Reserve Bank conducted open market sales operations on six occasions during Q2 to absorb ` 600 billion of surplus liquidity on a durable basis, in addition to the issuances of treasury bills (of tenors ranging from 312 days to 329 days) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) during April and May of ` 1 trillion. As a result, net average absorption of liquidity under the LAF declined from ` 1.6 trillion in the second half of September. The weighted average call rate (WACR), which on an average, traded below the repo rate by 18 basis points (bps) during July, firmed up by 5 bps in September on account of higher demand for liquidity around mid-September in response to advance tax outflows. in exports of 17. Reflecting improving global demand, merchandise export growth picked up in August 2017 after decelerating in the preceding three months. Engineering goods, petroleum products and chemicals were the major contributors to export growth in August 2017; growth readymade garments and drugs & pharmaceuticals too returned to positive territory. However, India\u2019s export growth continued to be lower than that of other emerging economies such as Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Vietnam, some of which have benefited from the global commodity price rebound. Import growth remained in double-digits for the eighth successive month in August and was fairly broad-based. While the surge in imports of crude oil and coal largely reflected a rise in international prices, imports of machinery, machine tools, iron and steel also picked up. Gold import volume has declined sequentially since June 2017, though the level in August was more than twice that of a year ago. The sharper increase in imports relative to exports resulted in a widening of the current account deficit in Q1 of 2017-18, even as net services exports and remittances picked up. Net foreign direct investment at US$ 10.6 billion in April-July 2017 was 24 per cent higher than during the same period of last year. While the debt segment of the domestic capital market attracted foreign portfolio investment of US$ 14.4 billion, there were significant outflows in the equity segment in August-September on account of geo-political uncertainties and expected normalisation of Fed asset purchases. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 399.7 billion on September 29, 2017. 18. In August, headline inflation was projected at 3 per cent in Q2 and 4.0-4.5 per cent in the second half of 2017-18. Actual inflation outcomes so far have been broadly in line with projections, though the extent of the rise in inflation excluding food and fuel has been somewhat higher than expected. The inflation path for the rest of 2017-18 is expected to be shaped by several factors. First, the assessment of food prices going forward is largely favourable, though the first advance estimates of kharif production pose some uncertainty. Early indicators show that prices of pulses which had declined significantly to undershoot trend levels in recent months, have now begun to stabilise. Second, some price revisions pending the goods and services tax (GST) implementation have been taking place. Third, there has been a broad-based increase in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Finally, international crude prices, which had started rising from early July, have firmed up further in September. Taking into account these factors, inflation is expected to rise from its current level and range between 4.2-4.6 per cent in the second half of this year, including the house rent allowance by the Centre (Chart 1). 19. As noted in the August policy, there are factors that continue to impart upside risks to this baseline inflation trajectory: (a) implementation of farm loan waivers by States may result in possible fiscal slippages and undermine the quality of public spending, thereby exerting pressure on prices; and (b) States\u2019 implementation of the salary and allowances award is not yet considered in the baseline projection; an increase by States similar to that by the Centre could push up headline inflation by about 100 basis points above the baseline over 18-24 months, a statistical effect that could have potential second round effects. However, adequate food stocks and effective supply management by the Government may keep food inflation more benign than assumed in the baseline. 20. Turning to growth projections, the loss of momentum in Q1 of 2017-18 and the first advance estimates of kharif foodgrains production are early setbacks that impart a downside to the outlook. The implementation of the GST so far also appears to have had an adverse impact, rendering prospects for the manufacturing sector uncertain in the short term. This may further delay the revival of investment activity, which is already hampered by stressed balance sheets of banks and corporates. Consumer confidence and overall business assessment of the manufacturing and services sectors surveyed by the Reserve Bank weakened in Q2 of 2017-18; on the positive side, firms expect a significant improvement in business sentiment in Q3. Taking into account the above factors, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 has been revised down to 6.7 per cent from the August 2017 projection of 7.3 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). Imparting an upside to this baseline, household consumption demand may get 21. a boost from upward salary and allowances revisions by states. Teething problems linked to the GST and bandwidth constraints may get resolved relatively soon, allowing growth to accelerate in H2. On the downside, a faster than expected rise in input costs and lack of pricing power may put further pressure on corporate margins, affecting value added by industry. Moreover, consumer confidence of households polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey has weakened in terms of the outlook on employment, income, prices faced and spending incurred. 22. The MPC observed that CPI inflation has risen by around two percentage points since its last meeting. These price pressures have coincided with an escalation of global geo-political uncertainty and heightened volatility in financial markets due to the US Fed\u2019s plans of balance sheet unwinding and the risk of normalisation by the European Central Bank. Such juxtaposition of risks to inflation needs to be carefully managed. Although the domestic food price outlook remains largely stable, generalised momentum is building in prices of items excluding food, especially emanating from crude oil. The possibility of fiscal slippages may add to this momentum in the future. The MPC also acknowledged the likelihood of the output gap widening, but requires more data to better ascertain the transient versus sustained headwinds in the recent growth prints. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The MPC also decided to keep the policy stance neutral and monitor incoming data closely. The MPC remains committed to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. 23. The MPC was of the view that various structural reforms introduced in the recent period will likely be growth augmenting over the medium- to long-term by improving the business environment, enhancing transparency and increasing formalisation of the economy. The Reserve Bank continues to work towards the resolution of stressed corporate exposures in bank balance sheets which should start yielding dividends for the economy over the medium term. 24. The MPC reiterated that it is imperative to reinvigorate investment activity which, in turn, would revive the demand for bank credit by industry as existing capacities get utilised and the requirements of new capacity open up to be financed. Recapitalising public sector banks adequately will ensure that credit flows to the productive sectors are not impeded and growth impulses not restrained. In addition, the following measures could be undertaken to support growth and achieve a faster closure of the output gap: a concerted drive to close the severe infrastructure gap; restarting stalled investment projects, particularly in the public sector; enhancing ease of doing business, including by further simplification of the GST; and ensuring faster rollout of the affordable housing program with time-bound single-window clearances and rationalisation of excessively high stamp duties by states. 25. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel were in favour of the monetary policy decision, while Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted for a policy rate reduction of at least 25 basis points. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by October 18, 2017. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on December 5 and 6, 2017. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.0 per cent Vote Member Yes Dr. Chetan Ghate Yes Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia No Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Yes Yes Dr. Viral V. Acharya Yes Dr. Urjit R. Patel 27. In the August review, I was concerned that the downward movement in both CPI headline inflation and inflation excluding food and fuel may not sustain into the durable future. With a roughly 200 basis points increase in headline inflation in the last two months, and with the acceleration of inflation excluding food and fuel to 4.6 per cent from 4.1 per cent, upside risks to the medium term inflation target of 4 per cent have again come to the fore. This suggests that the big dip in inflation excluding food and fuel starting in March has turned out to be temporary. 28. The rebound in headline inflation has largely been due to spikes in vegetable inflation that has made the CPI vegetable index come back to its earlier peak. I am also concerned about adverse demand-supply dynamics in crude prices which had led to a 22 per cent increase in crude prices since June 2017. A relaxation of end- year fiscal deficit targets if tax revenues take a hit due to GST-related disruptions also poses an upside risk to the medium term inflation target. On the other hand, I view the recent round of inflationary expectations data as positive, with the decline in the 3-month inflationary expectations being about 230 basis points since September 2016. 29. While there has been a secular decline in economic growth for the past 6 quarters, it is likely that the Q1:2017-18 GVA growth print of 5.6 per cent was possibly a trough, and that a revival in economic activity is possibly in the works. The economy has been subject to numerous policy shocks in the form of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), GST, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), loan waivers, and demonetisation, all of which have undoubtedly lead to some churning, but which will also move the economy to a reformed steady state. What makes me optimistic are the following factors: (i) both the August and September PMI in manufacturing have been in an expansion mode. (ii) An economic revival of the Eurozone will push up exports. (iii) Real wage growth of the magnitude of 6-8 per cent in the rural sector will continue to support consumption driven growth. Having said this, I continue to worry about the slowing rate of capital accumulation and its impact on lowering potential growth and total factor productivity (TFP), but would like to see the next GDP growth print to have a better sense of whether the current decline in growth is transient, or part of a secular trend. 30. In some joint research done by myself and some co-authors, on a calibrated/estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of the Indian economy, the variance decomposition from the baseline model shows that about half of the fluctuations (variance) in output in the Indian economy in the last five years are explained by TFP shocks, and one-third is explained by fiscal shocks. Monetary policy shocks only explain around 12 per cent of output variations. This highlights not only the weakness of monetary policy transmission in the Indian economy, but the need for continual structural reforms and rule bound fiscal policy which will stabilize the Indian business cycle. Taking into account these considerations, I vote for a pause in the policy repo 31. rate at today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. 32. On the inflation front, retail inflation recorded a five-month high in August, 2017. This was driven partly by the dissipation of the favourable base effect and a rebound in food inflation, due to an increase in vegetable prices. CPI inflation, excluding food and fuel, rose sharply as a result of hardening of prices in several categories. Housing inflation increased on account of higher house rent allowances for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission award. Other sub-groups witnessing an increase included household goods and services, clothing, footwear, and miscellaneous items. 33. Brent crude oil prices also surged in September, while the rupee weakened. Other upside risks to inflation include the impact of an expected decline in the production of foodgrains due to lower sowing during the kharif season; the uncertainty in the short-term with respect to the effect of GST; the effects of a possible central government stimulus; the likely fiscal slippages due to the farm loan waivers; and the introduction of the pay commission award by states. Further, a potential increase in financial market volatility due to global developments, including the unwinding of the balance sheet by the Fed and the possibility of normalisation by the ECB, are also major concerns. 34. These risks to inflation are reinforced by the responses to forward-looking surveys of consumers. Specifically, the qualitative responses to the September 2017 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of households indicate that the proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate rose over the three-month as well as the one-year horizons. The September round of the Consumer Confidence Survey also signals the expectation of an increase in the price level in the next one year. Moreover, an uptick in the Indian Future Inflation Gauge, a harbinger of inflation (constructed by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, with which the author is affiliated), indicates a firming in underlying inflationary pressures. 35. On the output front, GDP growth slowed down significantly in the first quarter of 2017-18, reflecting slower agricultural and manufacturing growth, along with tepid consumption and investment demand. Growth in services sector, however, picked up with an uptick in trade, hotels, transport and communication. The lacklustre growth is picked up by the September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey, which shows a fall in the Current Situation Index as well as the Future Expectations Index, due to worsening sentiment on income and employment. Furthermore, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Index, a predictor of future economic activity, has eased in recent months. This suggests an urgent need to revive investment activity and reinvigorate infrastructure-related projects, amongst other measures. 36. At the same time, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Exports Index, that anticipates the direction of growth in exports, is declining. It is also notable in this context that, while international growth is currently robust, ECRI\u2019s Leading Indexes of the global economy indicate waning global growth prospects. 37. In the current scenario, a wait and watch strategy is recommended with continuous monitoring of data to distinguish between a temporary effect and a long- lasting, structural impact. Thus, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. 39. During the last two months of July and August, the increase in the headline inflation as well as inflation without food and fuel was more than expected. My forecasts had provided for some spikes in inflation during these months, but the actual increase exceeded the forecasts. While the oil prices strengthened in the international markets, they are not expected to increase further substantially. Although the monsoon ended with a marginal shortfall in the rainfall, its impact on the food prices is not expected to be very adverse since the replenished buffer stocks would take care of whatever shortages occur. The real cause of concern right now is the estimates of real GDP during Q1 of 2017-18 that showed a significantly more than expected slowdown of economic activity indicating widening of the negative output gap in the economy. Considering these additional developments, I strongly plead for at least a 25 basis points (bps) cut in the policy rate. Reasons for my vote are the following: i) Households\u2019 one year ahead inflationary expectations according to the RBI survey have fallen over the last year sharply by 340 bps when the policy rate fell by only 50 bps. This implies a significant increase of 290 bps in the real interest rate for the households. The Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) Business Inflation Expectation Survey (BIES) shows that the businesses expect inflation one year ahead to be around 3.5 per cent in their costs. This inflation number is generally closely akin to the core inflation. iii) RBI survey has found that companies have started investing in financial assets rather than fixed assets. It indicates that the real interest cost on one hand and real interest rate on the other hand perceived by the companies are too high. This is supported by the decline in the new projects announced. iv) My inflation forecasts over six months and one year have only marginally changed upwards since I expect oil prices and exchange rates to be reasonably stable over medium term. Moreover, we had considered earlier such scenarios in our forecasts. Even RBI\u2019s forecast of inflation has not changed substantially and is around 4.3 per cent without the impact of revisions in house rent allowance. As I had mentioned in the August MPC minutes, our forecast is lower. In this context, it is worth observing that the headline inflation without including housing index is currently only around 3 per cent. v) RBI surveys continue to show persistently low capacity utilization at around 71-72 per cent indicating a sizeable negative output gap in the production sector. This is also supported by RBI consumer confidence surveys showing worsening sentiments for income, employment and overall environment. RBI has also revised its GVA growth forecast downward in its October Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Review for 2017-18 by 60 bps and for 2018-19 by 70 bps in its October Monetary Policy Report (MPR) compared to its April 2017 MPR. This by itself suggests that the negative output gap in the economy has widened at present and would continue widening in near future since output gap is calculated on levels and not rates of growth, which implies that the negative output gap would start narrowing only when the current growth rate exceeds the potential rate of growth. There are some sceptics who argue that in India, where physical infrastructure like roads and railways are over-crowded, a negative output gap simply cannot exist. However, this argument is not valid since it is based on misconception of the potential output. Congestion and overcrowding of certain type of physical infrastructure that could be due to wrong pricing and other policies usually lead to very low productivity and indicate sub-optimal allocation of resources. This corroborates rather than negating the existence of a negative output gap, because the potential output is defined in terms of the optimal utilization of resources and not the actual utilization of resources. For instance, previously congested and hence inefficient roads have turned more efficient with introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST). The existing capital is better utilized and produces more output. Moreover, we need to recognize that many other physical infrastructures like some airports, seaports, irrigation dams, hospitals, institutions of higher learning and several industrial plants and machinery lie severely underutilized. Similarly a significant proportion of the labour force is underutilized. Therefore, negative output gap and its widening at present as argued earlier cannot be denied. vii) A rule-based monetary policy underlying the Flexible Inflation Targeting framework would necessitate a very well justified policy rate cut under the present circumstances. Real interest rate with expected future inflation rate in the economy currently is too high compared to most other countries. Now it has started seriously hurting consumers of durable goods and producers and hence production. We also need to recognize explicitly the cost of sacrificing output growth in terms of unemployment and poverty when inflation situation is practically under control in the near to medium term. In order to address the problems created by expanding negative output gap, we need to bring down the real interest rate in the economy. In my view, the policy rate should have been cut by 50 bps long back in June 2017. A cut of 25 bps in August was too small and too late. We can still make the additional cut of 25 bps now if we want to be extremely cautious. Otherwise, my opinion is that we have a space for a cut of about 40 bps at present with due consideration to any possible upward risk to future inflation. 40. Recent inflation prints have vindicated my stance. They have also borne out the expectations of households and professional forecasters. All the factors I cited came into play in the inflation reading for August - the house rent allowance (HRA) for Central Government employees; the GST; the unfavourable reversal of base effects; and the seasonal spike in the prices of vegetables. Some of these factors will gain further traction over the months ahead. The firming up of pump prices of petrol and diesel, only partly due to rising international crude prices, has provided an additional upside to the inflation outlook in a froth-suffused financial environment. The recent reduction in excise duties on petroleum products is an acknowledgement of the social tolerance threshold for inflation from this source. 41. By contrast, all the factors conditioning the August rate reduction have either not materialized or reversed - inflation excluding the HRA will likely exceed 4 per cent by the end of the year; inflation excluding food and fuel has turned up and will likely stay above 4 per cent in the months ahead; the rollout of the GST has not been smooth; and the monsoon is sub-normal in terms of its distribution during the crucial sowing weeks. With various alternative exclusion-based indicators of inflation above 4 per cent, a vicious spiral could be developing \u2013 input costs; petroleum product prices, exchange rate depreciation; inflation expectations. Professional forecasters project inflation rising to 5 per cent by the first quarter of 2018-19. Households\u2019 qualitative expectations point to the rising probability of inflation rising faster than the current rate over the next three months. 42. Current inflation developments and, in particular, deviations of outcomes from forecasts are shaping the future path of inflation in an ongoing error correction. The primary objective of monetary policy enjoined by the RBI Act is challenged and the credibility of the MPC will be tested in the months ahead. 43. Meanwhile, growth outcomes have surprised on the downside. Parsing the data reveals that agricultural and allied activities are growing at broadly the same pace as in the first quarter of every year, while in the services sector, growth has accelerated. More recent indicators bear out these initial impulses. My sense is that the slowdown is troughing and activity will pick up in the second half of the year with better prospects for agriculture and services, and as the initial hitches associated with the GST get evened out. 44. The slowdown is essentially located in manufacturing, and reinvigorating it holds the key. The question is: is the weakness in manufacturing, which persists in spite of a reduction of 200 basis points in the policy rate, within the narrow remit of monetary policy? The advocacy for a further reduction in the policy rate is essentially a case for lowering the cost of capital or the hurdle rate to a level at which a subdued or even declining internal rate of return (IRR) becomes viable. In my view, this is not a sustainable proposition and may even be self-fulfilling: chasing a deteriorating IRR will only lead to higher inflation and no investment. 45. All indications point to a deeper malaise that chains down animal spirits in private enterprise and cries out for a bold structural transformation of the business and investment climate. The MPC\u2019s resolution sets out the elements of the desired policy response that will revive investment activity. A monetary policy reaction in the absence of mobilising on these fronts is time-inconsistent \u2013 the MPC commits to an inflation target over a medium term horizon but the persuasive pull of the transient weakening of growth in the interregnum potentially undermines this commitment. 46. I, therefore, vote for status quo, but only as long as inflation readings stay within the target of 4 per cent. It is time to be in readiness to raise the policy rate to quell the underlying drivers of inflation if they strengthen further. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 47. Over the past few years, household inflation expectations have been steadily getting anchored down as they are adapting to the realised inflation outcomes. However, these expectations still remain relatively high, and are likely also manifested in the continuing high level of rural and non-rural wage growth. Recent headline inflation prints have risen significantly from historic low in June and in a broad-based manner; in addition, oil-price risk and global market volatility have risen materially. In such a scenario, it is important in my view for the Reserve Bank to persist steadfastly with its objective (and mandate) of keeping medium-term inflation within a striking distance of the target of 4 per cent. 48. Real-time activity indicators have been volatile over the last two quarters and do not yet paint a clear picture. Hence, it is too early, in my view, to be able to isolate the transient component of the recent one-quarter loss of momentum over and above the gradual decline in overall growth that has taken place since the Q1 of 2016-17. The gradual decline, which has turned our measures of output gap negative, is best explained by the deleveraging underway in the heavily indebted parts of the corporate sector and in poor credit growth of public sector banks given they have inadequate capital relative to impending losses on legacy assets. 49. Corporate credit risk profile is showing some signs of improving gradually; the large distressed borrowers are being directed to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code; and efforts are under way to concretely address public sector bank health in near future. These structural changes will revive the affected economic activity, but with a lag. Teething problems, or at least the uncertainty, facing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, should also resolve soon. In the meantime, given our inflation outlook has risen quite some distance over the target of 4 per cent, there did not seem much room for monetary policy adjustment. 50. The Reserve Bank remains committed to improving the transmission of monetary policy. I believe there is still some scope left for transmission of past monetary policy accommodation to existing loan portfolio that is tied to the base rate. Our Study Group on the MCLR has proposed what I find a reasonable path going forward in referencing floating rate loans to simple market benchmarks that will improve transparency for borrowers and competitiveness in lending. I am hopeful that switching to one of the recommended benchmarks with more frequent resets will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in future. Statement by Dr. Urjit R. Patel 51. Headline CPI inflation has risen sharply in the last two months and there has been a broad-based increase in inflation excluding food and fuel. Even as the assessment of food prices going forward is generally favourable, some factors have imparted uncertainty to the near-term overall inflation outlook. Firstly, international crude prices have firmed up significantly in the more recent period. Second, global geo-political uncertainty and volatility in financial markets have increased. Third, a combination of farm loan debt waivers by state governments and the implementation of the pay commission award could entail some fiscal slippages and pose a risk to inflation. Notwithstanding some softening in the recent period, inflation expectations show downward rigidity. This is reflected in the high increase in staff cost, particularly in the manufacturing sector. 52. The loss of momentum in Q1 of 2017-18 has imparted a downside to the overall GVA outlook. The implementation of the GST has rendered prospects for the manufacturing sector uncertain in the short-term. This may further delay the acceleration in investment activity. However, there is a need for more data to assess whether the recent headwinds in overall GDP growth prints are transient or sustained. Prospects of agriculture are favourable, notwithstanding marginally lower estimates of kharif production. The Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey points to overall business sentiment improving in Q3. The manufacturing PMI remained in expansion mode in August and September. Output of core industries showed a robust growth in August. Several lead indicators of services sector activity \u2013 sales of commercial and passenger vehicles, international air passenger traffic, railway freight traffic, and foreign tourist arrivals \u2013 gained momentum in August. GVA growth is projected to strengthen in the second half of the year. 53. Recent structural reforms may have had some impact on growth in the short run. However, they will boost medium- to long-term growth prospects. To improve immediate growth prospects, teething troubles relating to GST need to be addressed expeditiously. Concerted efforts also need to be made to encourage investment activity by removing various constraints. Resolution of stressed balance sheets of banks remains important for supporting a revival in the investment cycle. Finally, government should adjust administered interest rates on savings instruments every quarter as per the formula to help with monetary transmission. 54. For keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis, it is important to recognise near and medium-term risks to the inflation outlook. We have to be vigilant on account of uncertainties on the external and fiscal fronts; this calls for a cautious approach. I, therefore, vote for keeping the policy repo rate on hold, while maintaining the stance as neutral. ", "file6": "The seventh meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on October 3 and 4, 2017 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:\u2013 (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting in August 2017, global economic activity has strengthened further and become broad-based. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US has continued to expand with revised Q2 GDP growing at its strongest pace in more than two years, supported by robust consumer spending and business fixed investment. Recent hurricanes could, however, weigh on economic activity in the near-term. In the Euro area, the economic recovery gained further traction and spread, underpinned by domestic demand. While private consumption benefited from employment gains, investment rose on the back of favourable financing conditions. The Euro area purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for manufacturing soared to its highest reading in more than six years. The Japanese economy continued on a path of healthy expansion despite a downward revision in growth since March 2017 on weaker than expected capital expenditure. 7. Among the major emerging market economies (EMEs), strong growth in Q2 in China was powered by retail sales, and imports grew at a rapid pace, suggesting robust domestic demand; investment activity, however, slowed down. The Brazilian economy expanded for two consecutive quarters in Q2 on improving terms of trade, even as the impact of recession persists on the labour market. Economic activity in Russia recovered further, supported by strengthening global demand, firming up of oil prices and accommodative monetary policy. Although South Africa has emerged out of recession in Q2, the economy faces economic and political challenges. 8. The latest assessment by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) indicates a significant improvement in global trade in 2017 over the lacklustre growth in 2016, backed by a resurgence of Asian trade flows and rising imports by North America. Crude oil prices hit a two-year high in September on account of the combined effect of a pick-up in demand, tightening supplies due to production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and declining crude oil inventories in the US. Metal prices have eased since mid-September on weaker than expected Chinese industrial production data. Bullion prices touched a year\u2019s high in early September on account of safe-haven demand due to geo-political tensions, before weakening somewhat in the second half. Weak non-oil commodity prices and low wage growth kept inflation pressures low in most AEs and subdued in several EMEs, largely reflecting country-specific factors. 9. Global financial markets have been driven mainly by the changing course of monetary policy in AEs, generally improving economic prospects and oscillating geo- political factors. Equity markets in most AEs have continued to rise. In EMEs, equities generally gained on improved global risk appetite, supported by upbeat economic data and expectations of a slower pace of monetary tightening in major AEs. While bond yields in major AEs moved sideways, they showed wider variation in EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar weakened further and fell to a multi-month low in September on weak inflation, though it recovered some lost ground in the last week of September on a hawkish US Fed stance and tensions around North Korea. The euro surged to a two and a half year high against the US dollar towards end-August on positive economic data, whereas the Japanese yen experienced sporadic bouts of volatility triggered by geo-political risks. Emerging market currencies showed divergent movements and remained highly sensitive to monetary policies of key AEs. Capital flows to EMEs have continued, but appear increasingly vulnerable to the normalisation of monetary policy by the US Fed. 10. On the domestic front, real gross value added (GVA) growth slowed significantly in Q1 of 2017-18, cushioned partly by the extensive front-loading of expenditure by the central government. GVA growth in agriculture and allied activities slackened quarter-on-quarter in the usual first quarter moderation, partly reflecting deceleration in the growth of livestock products, forestry and fisheries. Industrial sector GVA growth fell sequentially as well as on a y-o-y basis. The manufacturing sector \u2013 the dominant component of industrial GVA \u2013 grew by 1.2 per cent, the lowest in the last 20 quarters. The mining sector, which showed signs of improvement in the second half of 2016-17, entered into contraction mode again in Q1 of 2017-18, on account of a decline in coal production and subdued crude oil production. Services sector performance, however, improved markedly, supported mainly by trade, hotels, transport and communication, which bounced back after a persistent slowdown throughout 2016-17. Construction picked up pace after contracting in Q4 of 2016-17. Financial, real estate and professional services turned around from their lacklustre performance in the second half of 2016-17. Of the constituents of aggregate demand, growth in private consumption expenditure was at a six-quarter low in Q1 of 2017-18. Gross fixed capital formation exhibited a modest recovery in Q1 in contrast to a contraction in the preceding quarter. Turning to Q2, the south-west monsoon, which arrived early and progressed 11. well till the first week of July, lost momentum from mid-July to August \u2013 the crucial period for kharif sowing. By end-September, the cumulative rainfall was deficient by around 5 per cent relative to the long period average, with 17 per cent of the geographical area of the country receiving deficient rainfall. The live storage in reservoirs fell to 66 per cent of the full capacity as compared with 74 per cent a year ago. The uneven spatial distribution of the monsoon was reflected in the first advance estimates of kharif production by the Ministry of Agriculture, which were below the level of the previous year due to lower area sown under major crops including rice, coarse cereals, pulses, oilseeds, jute and mesta. 12. The index of industrial production (IIP) recovered marginally in July 2017 from the contraction in June on the back of a recovery in mining, quarrying and electricity generation. However, manufacturing remained weak. In terms of the use-based classification, contraction in capital goods, intermediate goods and consumer durables pulled down overall IIP growth. In August, however, the output of core industries posted robust growth on the back of an uptick in coal production and electricity generation. The manufacturing PMI moved into expansion zone in August and September 2017 on the strength of new orders. 13. On the services side, the picture remained mixed. Many indicators pointed to improved performance even as the services PMI continued in the contraction zone in August due to low new orders. In the construction segment, steel consumption was robust. In the transportation sector, sales of commercial and passenger vehicles as well as two and three-wheelers, railway freight traffic and international air passenger traffic showed significant upticks. However, cement production, cargo handled at major ports, domestic air freight and passenger traffic showed weak performance. 14. Retail inflation measured by year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI) edged up sequentially in July and August to reach a five month high, due entirely to a sharp pick up in momentum as the favourable base effect tapered off in July and disappeared in August. After a decline in prices in June, food inflation rebounded in the following two months, driven mainly by a sharp rise in vegetable prices, along with the rise in inflation in prepared meals and fruits. Cereals inflation remained benign, while deflation in pulses continued for the ninth successive month. Fuel group inflation remained broadly unchanged in August even as inflation in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, firewood and chips rose. Petroleum product prices tracked the hardening of international crude oil prices. 15. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel also increased sharply in July and further in August, reversing from its trough in June 2017. The increase was broad-based in both goods and services. Housing inflation hardened further in August on account of higher house rent allowances for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission award. Inflation in household goods and services in health, recreation and clothing & footwear sub-groups increased. Quantitative inflation expectations of households eased in the September 2017 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey. However, in terms of qualitative responses, the proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate rose markedly for the three-month as well as one-year ahead horizons. Farm and industry input costs picked up in August. Real wages in the rural and organised sectors continued to edge up. The Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey showed that corporate pricing power for the manufacturing sector remained weak. In contrast, firms polled for the services sector PMI reported a sharp rise in prices charged. 16. Surplus liquidity in the system persisted through Q2 even as the build-up in government cash balances since mid-September 2017 due to advance tax outflows reduced the size of the surplus liquidity significantly in the second half of the month. Currency in circulation increased at a moderate pace during Q2, by ` 569 billion as against ` 1,964 billion during Q1, reflecting the usual seasonality. Consistent with the guidance given in April 2017 on liquidity, the Reserve Bank conducted open market sales operations on six occasions during Q2 to absorb ` 600 billion of surplus liquidity on a durable basis, in addition to the issuances of treasury bills (of tenors ranging from 312 days to 329 days) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) during April and May of ` 1 trillion. As a result, net average absorption of liquidity under the LAF declined from ` 1.6 trillion in the second half of September. The weighted average call rate (WACR), which on an average, traded below the repo rate by 18 basis points (bps) during July, firmed up by 5 bps in September on account of higher demand for liquidity around mid-September in response to advance tax outflows. in exports of 17. Reflecting improving global demand, merchandise export growth picked up in August 2017 after decelerating in the preceding three months. Engineering goods, petroleum products and chemicals were the major contributors to export growth in August 2017; growth readymade garments and drugs & pharmaceuticals too returned to positive territory. However, India\u2019s export growth continued to be lower than that of other emerging economies such as Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey and Vietnam, some of which have benefited from the global commodity price rebound. Import growth remained in double-digits for the eighth successive month in August and was fairly broad-based. While the surge in imports of crude oil and coal largely reflected a rise in international prices, imports of machinery, machine tools, iron and steel also picked up. Gold import volume has declined sequentially since June 2017, though the level in August was more than twice that of a year ago. The sharper increase in imports relative to exports resulted in a widening of the current account deficit in Q1 of 2017-18, even as net services exports and remittances picked up. Net foreign direct investment at US$ 10.6 billion in April-July 2017 was 24 per cent higher than during the same period of last year. While the debt segment of the domestic capital market attracted foreign portfolio investment of US$ 14.4 billion, there were significant outflows in the equity segment in August-September on account of geo-political uncertainties and expected normalisation of Fed asset purchases. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 399.7 billion on September 29, 2017. 18. In August, headline inflation was projected at 3 per cent in Q2 and 4.0-4.5 per cent in the second half of 2017-18. Actual inflation outcomes so far have been broadly in line with projections, though the extent of the rise in inflation excluding food and fuel has been somewhat higher than expected. The inflation path for the rest of 2017-18 is expected to be shaped by several factors. First, the assessment of food prices going forward is largely favourable, though the first advance estimates of kharif production pose some uncertainty. Early indicators show that prices of pulses which had declined significantly to undershoot trend levels in recent months, have now begun to stabilise. Second, some price revisions pending the goods and services tax (GST) implementation have been taking place. Third, there has been a broad-based increase in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Finally, international crude prices, which had started rising from early July, have firmed up further in September. Taking into account these factors, inflation is expected to rise from its current level and range between 4.2-4.6 per cent in the second half of this year, including the house rent allowance by the Centre (Chart 1). 19. As noted in the August policy, there are factors that continue to impart upside risks to this baseline inflation trajectory: (a) implementation of farm loan waivers by States may result in possible fiscal slippages and undermine the quality of public spending, thereby exerting pressure on prices; and (b) States\u2019 implementation of the salary and allowances award is not yet considered in the baseline projection; an increase by States similar to that by the Centre could push up headline inflation by about 100 basis points above the baseline over 18-24 months, a statistical effect that could have potential second round effects. However, adequate food stocks and effective supply management by the Government may keep food inflation more benign than assumed in the baseline. 20. Turning to growth projections, the loss of momentum in Q1 of 2017-18 and the first advance estimates of kharif foodgrains production are early setbacks that impart a downside to the outlook. The implementation of the GST so far also appears to have had an adverse impact, rendering prospects for the manufacturing sector uncertain in the short term. This may further delay the revival of investment activity, which is already hampered by stressed balance sheets of banks and corporates. Consumer confidence and overall business assessment of the manufacturing and services sectors surveyed by the Reserve Bank weakened in Q2 of 2017-18; on the positive side, firms expect a significant improvement in business sentiment in Q3. Taking into account the above factors, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 has been revised down to 6.7 per cent from the August 2017 projection of 7.3 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). Imparting an upside to this baseline, household consumption demand may get 21. a boost from upward salary and allowances revisions by states. Teething problems linked to the GST and bandwidth constraints may get resolved relatively soon, allowing growth to accelerate in H2. On the downside, a faster than expected rise in input costs and lack of pricing power may put further pressure on corporate margins, affecting value added by industry. Moreover, consumer confidence of households polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey has weakened in terms of the outlook on employment, income, prices faced and spending incurred. 22. The MPC observed that CPI inflation has risen by around two percentage points since its last meeting. These price pressures have coincided with an escalation of global geo-political uncertainty and heightened volatility in financial markets due to the US Fed\u2019s plans of balance sheet unwinding and the risk of normalisation by the European Central Bank. Such juxtaposition of risks to inflation needs to be carefully managed. Although the domestic food price outlook remains largely stable, generalised momentum is building in prices of items excluding food, especially emanating from crude oil. The possibility of fiscal slippages may add to this momentum in the future. The MPC also acknowledged the likelihood of the output gap widening, but requires more data to better ascertain the transient versus sustained headwinds in the recent growth prints. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The MPC also decided to keep the policy stance neutral and monitor incoming data closely. The MPC remains committed to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. 23. The MPC was of the view that various structural reforms introduced in the recent period will likely be growth augmenting over the medium- to long-term by improving the business environment, enhancing transparency and increasing formalisation of the economy. The Reserve Bank continues to work towards the resolution of stressed corporate exposures in bank balance sheets which should start yielding dividends for the economy over the medium term. 24. The MPC reiterated that it is imperative to reinvigorate investment activity which, in turn, would revive the demand for bank credit by industry as existing capacities get utilised and the requirements of new capacity open up to be financed. Recapitalising public sector banks adequately will ensure that credit flows to the productive sectors are not impeded and growth impulses not restrained. In addition, the following measures could be undertaken to support growth and achieve a faster closure of the output gap: a concerted drive to close the severe infrastructure gap; restarting stalled investment projects, particularly in the public sector; enhancing ease of doing business, including by further simplification of the GST; and ensuring faster rollout of the affordable housing program with time-bound single-window clearances and rationalisation of excessively high stamp duties by states. 25. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel were in favour of the monetary policy decision, while Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted for a policy rate reduction of at least 25 basis points. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by October 18, 2017. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on December 5 and 6, 2017. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.0 per cent Vote Member Yes Dr. Chetan Ghate Yes Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia No Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Yes Yes Dr. Viral V. Acharya Yes Dr. Urjit R. Patel 27. In the August review, I was concerned that the downward movement in both CPI headline inflation and inflation excluding food and fuel may not sustain into the durable future. With a roughly 200 basis points increase in headline inflation in the last two months, and with the acceleration of inflation excluding food and fuel to 4.6 per cent from 4.1 per cent, upside risks to the medium term inflation target of 4 per cent have again come to the fore. This suggests that the big dip in inflation excluding food and fuel starting in March has turned out to be temporary. 28. The rebound in headline inflation has largely been due to spikes in vegetable inflation that has made the CPI vegetable index come back to its earlier peak. I am also concerned about adverse demand-supply dynamics in crude prices which had led to a 22 per cent increase in crude prices since June 2017. A relaxation of end- year fiscal deficit targets if tax revenues take a hit due to GST-related disruptions also poses an upside risk to the medium term inflation target. On the other hand, I view the recent round of inflationary expectations data as positive, with the decline in the 3-month inflationary expectations being about 230 basis points since September 2016. 29. While there has been a secular decline in economic growth for the past 6 quarters, it is likely that the Q1:2017-18 GVA growth print of 5.6 per cent was possibly a trough, and that a revival in economic activity is possibly in the works. The economy has been subject to numerous policy shocks in the form of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), GST, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), loan waivers, and demonetisation, all of which have undoubtedly lead to some churning, but which will also move the economy to a reformed steady state. What makes me optimistic are the following factors: (i) both the August and September PMI in manufacturing have been in an expansion mode. (ii) An economic revival of the Eurozone will push up exports. (iii) Real wage growth of the magnitude of 6-8 per cent in the rural sector will continue to support consumption driven growth. Having said this, I continue to worry about the slowing rate of capital accumulation and its impact on lowering potential growth and total factor productivity (TFP), but would like to see the next GDP growth print to have a better sense of whether the current decline in growth is transient, or part of a secular trend. 30. In some joint research done by myself and some co-authors, on a calibrated/estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of the Indian economy, the variance decomposition from the baseline model shows that about half of the fluctuations (variance) in output in the Indian economy in the last five years are explained by TFP shocks, and one-third is explained by fiscal shocks. Monetary policy shocks only explain around 12 per cent of output variations. This highlights not only the weakness of monetary policy transmission in the Indian economy, but the need for continual structural reforms and rule bound fiscal policy which will stabilize the Indian business cycle. Taking into account these considerations, I vote for a pause in the policy repo 31. rate at today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. 32. On the inflation front, retail inflation recorded a five-month high in August, 2017. This was driven partly by the dissipation of the favourable base effect and a rebound in food inflation, due to an increase in vegetable prices. CPI inflation, excluding food and fuel, rose sharply as a result of hardening of prices in several categories. Housing inflation increased on account of higher house rent allowances for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission award. Other sub-groups witnessing an increase included household goods and services, clothing, footwear, and miscellaneous items. 33. Brent crude oil prices also surged in September, while the rupee weakened. Other upside risks to inflation include the impact of an expected decline in the production of foodgrains due to lower sowing during the kharif season; the uncertainty in the short-term with respect to the effect of GST; the effects of a possible central government stimulus; the likely fiscal slippages due to the farm loan waivers; and the introduction of the pay commission award by states. Further, a potential increase in financial market volatility due to global developments, including the unwinding of the balance sheet by the Fed and the possibility of normalisation by the ECB, are also major concerns. 34. These risks to inflation are reinforced by the responses to forward-looking surveys of consumers. Specifically, the qualitative responses to the September 2017 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of households indicate that the proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate rose over the three-month as well as the one-year horizons. The September round of the Consumer Confidence Survey also signals the expectation of an increase in the price level in the next one year. Moreover, an uptick in the Indian Future Inflation Gauge, a harbinger of inflation (constructed by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, with which the author is affiliated), indicates a firming in underlying inflationary pressures. 35. On the output front, GDP growth slowed down significantly in the first quarter of 2017-18, reflecting slower agricultural and manufacturing growth, along with tepid consumption and investment demand. Growth in services sector, however, picked up with an uptick in trade, hotels, transport and communication. The lacklustre growth is picked up by the September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey, which shows a fall in the Current Situation Index as well as the Future Expectations Index, due to worsening sentiment on income and employment. Furthermore, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Index, a predictor of future economic activity, has eased in recent months. This suggests an urgent need to revive investment activity and reinvigorate infrastructure-related projects, amongst other measures. 36. At the same time, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Exports Index, that anticipates the direction of growth in exports, is declining. It is also notable in this context that, while international growth is currently robust, ECRI\u2019s Leading Indexes of the global economy indicate waning global growth prospects. 37. In the current scenario, a wait and watch strategy is recommended with continuous monitoring of data to distinguish between a temporary effect and a long- lasting, structural impact. Thus, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. 39. During the last two months of July and August, the increase in the headline inflation as well as inflation without food and fuel was more than expected. My forecasts had provided for some spikes in inflation during these months, but the actual increase exceeded the forecasts. While the oil prices strengthened in the international markets, they are not expected to increase further substantially. Although the monsoon ended with a marginal shortfall in the rainfall, its impact on the food prices is not expected to be very adverse since the replenished buffer stocks would take care of whatever shortages occur. The real cause of concern right now is the estimates of real GDP during Q1 of 2017-18 that showed a significantly more than expected slowdown of economic activity indicating widening of the negative output gap in the economy. Considering these additional developments, I strongly plead for at least a 25 basis points (bps) cut in the policy rate. Reasons for my vote are the following: i) Households\u2019 one year ahead inflationary expectations according to the RBI survey have fallen over the last year sharply by 340 bps when the policy rate fell by only 50 bps. This implies a significant increase of 290 bps in the real interest rate for the households. The Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) Business Inflation Expectation Survey (BIES) shows that the businesses expect inflation one year ahead to be around 3.5 per cent in their costs. This inflation number is generally closely akin to the core inflation. iii) RBI survey has found that companies have started investing in financial assets rather than fixed assets. It indicates that the real interest cost on one hand and real interest rate on the other hand perceived by the companies are too high. This is supported by the decline in the new projects announced. iv) My inflation forecasts over six months and one year have only marginally changed upwards since I expect oil prices and exchange rates to be reasonably stable over medium term. Moreover, we had considered earlier such scenarios in our forecasts. Even RBI\u2019s forecast of inflation has not changed substantially and is around 4.3 per cent without the impact of revisions in house rent allowance. As I had mentioned in the August MPC minutes, our forecast is lower. In this context, it is worth observing that the headline inflation without including housing index is currently only around 3 per cent. v) RBI surveys continue to show persistently low capacity utilization at around 71-72 per cent indicating a sizeable negative output gap in the production sector. This is also supported by RBI consumer confidence surveys showing worsening sentiments for income, employment and overall environment. RBI has also revised its GVA growth forecast downward in its October Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Review for 2017-18 by 60 bps and for 2018-19 by 70 bps in its October Monetary Policy Report (MPR) compared to its April 2017 MPR. This by itself suggests that the negative output gap in the economy has widened at present and would continue widening in near future since output gap is calculated on levels and not rates of growth, which implies that the negative output gap would start narrowing only when the current growth rate exceeds the potential rate of growth. There are some sceptics who argue that in India, where physical infrastructure like roads and railways are over-crowded, a negative output gap simply cannot exist. However, this argument is not valid since it is based on misconception of the potential output. Congestion and overcrowding of certain type of physical infrastructure that could be due to wrong pricing and other policies usually lead to very low productivity and indicate sub-optimal allocation of resources. This corroborates rather than negating the existence of a negative output gap, because the potential output is defined in terms of the optimal utilization of resources and not the actual utilization of resources. For instance, previously congested and hence inefficient roads have turned more efficient with introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST). The existing capital is better utilized and produces more output. Moreover, we need to recognize that many other physical infrastructures like some airports, seaports, irrigation dams, hospitals, institutions of higher learning and several industrial plants and machinery lie severely underutilized. Similarly a significant proportion of the labour force is underutilized. Therefore, negative output gap and its widening at present as argued earlier cannot be denied. vii) A rule-based monetary policy underlying the Flexible Inflation Targeting framework would necessitate a very well justified policy rate cut under the present circumstances. Real interest rate with expected future inflation rate in the economy currently is too high compared to most other countries. Now it has started seriously hurting consumers of durable goods and producers and hence production. We also need to recognize explicitly the cost of sacrificing output growth in terms of unemployment and poverty when inflation situation is practically under control in the near to medium term. In order to address the problems created by expanding negative output gap, we need to bring down the real interest rate in the economy. In my view, the policy rate should have been cut by 50 bps long back in June 2017. A cut of 25 bps in August was too small and too late. We can still make the additional cut of 25 bps now if we want to be extremely cautious. Otherwise, my opinion is that we have a space for a cut of about 40 bps at present with due consideration to any possible upward risk to future inflation. 40. Recent inflation prints have vindicated my stance. They have also borne out the expectations of households and professional forecasters. All the factors I cited came into play in the inflation reading for August - the house rent allowance (HRA) for Central Government employees; the GST; the unfavourable reversal of base effects; and the seasonal spike in the prices of vegetables. Some of these factors will gain further traction over the months ahead. The firming up of pump prices of petrol and diesel, only partly due to rising international crude prices, has provided an additional upside to the inflation outlook in a froth-suffused financial environment. The recent reduction in excise duties on petroleum products is an acknowledgement of the social tolerance threshold for inflation from this source. 41. By contrast, all the factors conditioning the August rate reduction have either not materialized or reversed - inflation excluding the HRA will likely exceed 4 per cent by the end of the year; inflation excluding food and fuel has turned up and will likely stay above 4 per cent in the months ahead; the rollout of the GST has not been smooth; and the monsoon is sub-normal in terms of its distribution during the crucial sowing weeks. With various alternative exclusion-based indicators of inflation above 4 per cent, a vicious spiral could be developing \u2013 input costs; petroleum product prices, exchange rate depreciation; inflation expectations. Professional forecasters project inflation rising to 5 per cent by the first quarter of 2018-19. Households\u2019 qualitative expectations point to the rising probability of inflation rising faster than the current rate over the next three months. 42. Current inflation developments and, in particular, deviations of outcomes from forecasts are shaping the future path of inflation in an ongoing error correction. The primary objective of monetary policy enjoined by the RBI Act is challenged and the credibility of the MPC will be tested in the months ahead. 43. Meanwhile, growth outcomes have surprised on the downside. Parsing the data reveals that agricultural and allied activities are growing at broadly the same pace as in the first quarter of every year, while in the services sector, growth has accelerated. More recent indicators bear out these initial impulses. My sense is that the slowdown is troughing and activity will pick up in the second half of the year with better prospects for agriculture and services, and as the initial hitches associated with the GST get evened out. 44. The slowdown is essentially located in manufacturing, and reinvigorating it holds the key. The question is: is the weakness in manufacturing, which persists in spite of a reduction of 200 basis points in the policy rate, within the narrow remit of monetary policy? The advocacy for a further reduction in the policy rate is essentially a case for lowering the cost of capital or the hurdle rate to a level at which a subdued or even declining internal rate of return (IRR) becomes viable. In my view, this is not a sustainable proposition and may even be self-fulfilling: chasing a deteriorating IRR will only lead to higher inflation and no investment. 45. All indications point to a deeper malaise that chains down animal spirits in private enterprise and cries out for a bold structural transformation of the business and investment climate. The MPC\u2019s resolution sets out the elements of the desired policy response that will revive investment activity. A monetary policy reaction in the absence of mobilising on these fronts is time-inconsistent \u2013 the MPC commits to an inflation target over a medium term horizon but the persuasive pull of the transient weakening of growth in the interregnum potentially undermines this commitment. 46. I, therefore, vote for status quo, but only as long as inflation readings stay within the target of 4 per cent. It is time to be in readiness to raise the policy rate to quell the underlying drivers of inflation if they strengthen further. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 47. Over the past few years, household inflation expectations have been steadily getting anchored down as they are adapting to the realised inflation outcomes. However, these expectations still remain relatively high, and are likely also manifested in the continuing high level of rural and non-rural wage growth. Recent headline inflation prints have risen significantly from historic low in June and in a broad-based manner; in addition, oil-price risk and global market volatility have risen materially. In such a scenario, it is important in my view for the Reserve Bank to persist steadfastly with its objective (and mandate) of keeping medium-term inflation within a striking distance of the target of 4 per cent. 48. Real-time activity indicators have been volatile over the last two quarters and do not yet paint a clear picture. Hence, it is too early, in my view, to be able to isolate the transient component of the recent one-quarter loss of momentum over and above the gradual decline in overall growth that has taken place since the Q1 of 2016-17. The gradual decline, which has turned our measures of output gap negative, is best explained by the deleveraging underway in the heavily indebted parts of the corporate sector and in poor credit growth of public sector banks given they have inadequate capital relative to impending losses on legacy assets. 49. Corporate credit risk profile is showing some signs of improving gradually; the large distressed borrowers are being directed to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code; and efforts are under way to concretely address public sector bank health in near future. These structural changes will revive the affected economic activity, but with a lag. Teething problems, or at least the uncertainty, facing the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, should also resolve soon. In the meantime, given our inflation outlook has risen quite some distance over the target of 4 per cent, there did not seem much room for monetary policy adjustment. 50. The Reserve Bank remains committed to improving the transmission of monetary policy. I believe there is still some scope left for transmission of past monetary policy accommodation to existing loan portfolio that is tied to the base rate. Our Study Group on the MCLR has proposed what I find a reasonable path going forward in referencing floating rate loans to simple market benchmarks that will improve transparency for borrowers and competitiveness in lending. I am hopeful that switching to one of the recommended benchmarks with more frequent resets will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in future. Statement by Dr. Urjit R. Patel 51. Headline CPI inflation has risen sharply in the last two months and there has been a broad-based increase in inflation excluding food and fuel. Even as the assessment of food prices going forward is generally favourable, some factors have imparted uncertainty to the near-term overall inflation outlook. Firstly, international crude prices have firmed up significantly in the more recent period. Second, global geo-political uncertainty and volatility in financial markets have increased. Third, a combination of farm loan debt waivers by state governments and the implementation of the pay commission award could entail some fiscal slippages and pose a risk to inflation. Notwithstanding some softening in the recent period, inflation expectations show downward rigidity. This is reflected in the high increase in staff cost, particularly in the manufacturing sector. 52. The loss of momentum in Q1 of 2017-18 has imparted a downside to the overall GVA outlook. The implementation of the GST has rendered prospects for the manufacturing sector uncertain in the short-term. This may further delay the acceleration in investment activity. However, there is a need for more data to assess whether the recent headwinds in overall GDP growth prints are transient or sustained. Prospects of agriculture are favourable, notwithstanding marginally lower estimates of kharif production. The Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey points to overall business sentiment improving in Q3. The manufacturing PMI remained in expansion mode in August and September. Output of core industries showed a robust growth in August. Several lead indicators of services sector activity \u2013 sales of commercial and passenger vehicles, international air passenger traffic, railway freight traffic, and foreign tourist arrivals \u2013 gained momentum in August. GVA growth is projected to strengthen in the second half of the year. 53. Recent structural reforms may have had some impact on growth in the short run. However, they will boost medium- to long-term growth prospects. To improve immediate growth prospects, teething troubles relating to GST need to be addressed expeditiously. Concerted efforts also need to be made to encourage investment activity by removing various constraints. Resolution of stressed balance sheets of banks remains important for supporting a revival in the investment cycle. Finally, government should adjust administered interest rates on savings instruments every quarter as per the formula to help with monetary transmission. 54. For keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis, it is important to recognise near and medium-term risks to the inflation outlook. We have to be vigilant on account of uncertainties on the external and fiscal fronts; this calls for a cautious approach. I, therefore, vote for keeping the policy repo rate on hold, while maintaining the stance as neutral. ", "file7": "The eighth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on December 5 and 6, 2017 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:\u2013 (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit confidence, households\u2019 conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the last meeting of the MPC in October 2017, global economic activity has been gaining momentum through the final quarter of the year, driven mainly by advanced economies (AEs). US growth remained largely resilient to hurricanes and grew at the highest pace in the past three years in Q3 of 2017, with positive contributions from private consumption, investment activity and net exports. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 per cent in October, the lowest in the last 17 years. In the Euro area, economic activity expanded, underpinned by accommodative monetary policy and strong job gains. The Japanese economy also continued to grow in Q3, largely supported by external demand, which helped compensate for the slowing of domestic consumption. Among major emerging market economies (EMEs), the services sector remained the 7. main driver of growth in China in Q3. However, weakness in real estate and construction activity remained a drag on growth. In Brazil, incoming data suggest that the recovery gained further momentum in Q3, with unemployment touching an intra-year low in September. Business and consumer confidence rose in October. Economic activity in Russia moderated in Q3 due to weakness in industrial production. The South African economy continued to face headwinds from weak manufacturing activity, elevated levels of unemployment and political instability. 8. The latest assessment by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for Q4 indicates a loss of momentum in global trade due to declining export orders. Crude oil prices touched a two- and-a-half-year high in early November on account of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 (OPEC) efforts to rebalance the market. Bullion prices have been under some selling pressure on account of the rising US dollar. Weak non-oil commodity prices and subdued wage dynamics have kept inflation contained in many AEs, while the inflation scenario remains diverse in major EMEs. Global financial markets have remained buoyant, reflecting the improving economic 9. outlook and the gradual normalisation of monetary policy by the US Fed. Equity markets have gained on improved corporate earnings and anticipation of large tax cuts in the US. Although equity markets have made gains in EMEs in general, they faced risk aversion in some economies. While bond yields in most AEs have moved sideways in the absence of inflation pressures, they have risen across most EMEs on country-specific factors. In currency markets, the US dollar has gained, while the surge in the euro on positive economic data lost some momentum in November due to political uncertainty. Several emerging market currencies weakened due to domestic factors. Capital inflows to EMEs have been differentiating among countries, based on investor perceptions of risk-return trade-offs. 10. On the domestic front, the growth of real gross value added (GVA) accelerated sequentially in Q2 of 2017-18, after five consecutive quarters of deceleration. It was powered by a sharp acceleration in industrial activity. All the three sub-sectors of industry registered higher growth. GVA growth in the manufacturing sector \u2013 the key component of industry \u2013 accelerated sharply on improved demand and re-stocking post goods and services tax (GST) implementation. The mining sector expanded in Q2 due to higher coal and natural gas production. GVA growth in the electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services sector also strengthened on higher demand. In contrast, growth in agriculture and allied activities slackened, reflecting the lower than expected kharif harvest. Activity in the services sector decelerated, mainly on account of slowdown in financial, insurance, real estate and 2 professional services, and in public administration, defence and other services (PADO) following the large front-loading of government expenditure in Q1. Despite some improvement, construction sector growth remained tepid due to transitory effects of the RERA and GST implementation. Growth in the trade, hotels, transport and communication sub-group remained resilient, in spite of some slowdown in growth in Q2 as compared with the previous quarter. On the expenditure side, the growth of gross fixed capital formation improved for the second successive quarter. However, growth in private final consumption expenditure \u2013 the mainstay of aggregate demand \u2013 slowed to an eight-quarter low in Q2. Looking beyond Q2, rabi sowing in Q3 has so far been marginally lagging behind the 11. acreage sown during the comparable period of the previous year. Precipitation since October has remained at around 13 per cent below the long period average (LPA). Major reservoirs, the main source of irrigation during the rabi season, were at 64 per cent of the full reservoir level vis-a-vis 67 per cent in the previous year. On the positive side, pulses sowing increased significantly as compared with a year ago, partly reflecting the impact of lifting of the export ban for all varieties of pulses. Available high-frequency indicators suggest a mixed picture of industrial activity for 12. Q3. Core industries\u2019 growth was flat in October as all constituents barring steel and fertilisers slowed down sequentially. Coal mining, which revived strongly in Q2, slowed down too, while cement production contracted. In contrast, the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which fell in October, rebounded in November, driven by output and new orders. Also, according to the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS), production is expected to pick up in Q3 as order books are rising. Services sector activity has remained mixed in October. In the transportation sector, 13. sales of commercial vehicles decelerated; those of passenger vehicles and two-wheeler turned into contraction mode. By contrast, domestic and international air passenger and freight traffic, and railway freight expanded robustly. The Reserve Bank\u2019s survey suggests that sentiments on service sector activity for Q3 are upbeat and auto sales have rebounded in November. On the other hand, PMI for services moved into contraction zone in November. 14. Retail inflation measured by year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI) recorded a seven-month high in October, driven by a sharp uptick in momentum, tempered partly by some favourable base effects. Food inflation was volatile in the last two months \u2013 declining sharply in September and bouncing back in October \u2013 due mainly to vegetables and fruits. Milk and eggs inflation has shown an uptick, while pulses inflation remained negative for the eleventh successive month in October. Cereal inflation remained stable. Fuel group inflation, which has been on an upward trajectory since July, accelerated further due to a sharp pick-up in inflation in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, coke and electricity. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel, which increased from July to September, 15. remained steady in October. This reflected the softening of petroleum product prices on account of the reversal of taxes on petroleum products by the central and state governments. However, there was a hardening of housing inflation following the implementation of higher house rent allowances for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission award. The Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of households showed inflation expectations firming up in 16. the latest round for both three months ahead and one year ahead horizons. Farm and industrial raw material costs rose in October. Firms responding to the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey expect to pass on the increase in input prices to their output prices. Turning to other costs, wage growth in the organised sector edged up, while rural wage growth weakened, particularly in agriculture. Surplus liquidity in the system has continued to decline during October and 17. November. Currency in circulation increased by `736 billion in Q3 (up to December 1, 2017) over end-September on festival demand. The Reserve Bank managed surplus liquidity through the conduct of regular variable rate reverse repo auctions of various tenors, ranging from overnight to 28 days. Net average daily absorption of liquidity under the LAF declined from `2,229 billion in September to `1,400 billion in October 2017 and further to `718 billion in November. The Reserve Bank conducted open market sales of `300 billion in October- November, taking the total absorption of durable liquidity during the financial year so far to `1.9 trillion, comprising `900 billion in the form of open market sales and `1 trillion of long- term treasury bills under the market stabilisation scheme. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded 12 bps and 15 bps below the repo rate during October and November, respectively, as against 13 bps in September. 18. Merchandise exports declined by 1.1 per cent in October 2017 after showing positive growth for 14 consecutive months. A sustained increase in exports of engineering goods, petroleum products and chemicals during the month was outweighed by a sharp fall in shipments of gems and jewellery, ready-made garments, and drugs and pharmaceuticals. Imports continued to expand, though at a modest pace. Although gold imports rose sequentially in October, they moderated from their level a year ago. Consequently, the trade deficit widened again in October. Despite moderation in September, net foreign direct investment in H1 of 2017-18 was at the same level as a year ago. With the announcement of the recapitalisation plan for public sector banks, foreign portfolio inflows into equities resumed sharply in October, after recording outflows in the preceding month. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 401.94 billion on November 30, 2017. Outlook 19. The October bi-monthly statement projected inflation to rise and range between 4.2- 4.6 per cent in the second half of this year, including the impact of increase in house rent allowance (HRA) by the Centre. The headline inflation outcomes have evolved broadly in line with projections. Going forward, the inflation path will be influenced by several factors. First, moderation in inflation excluding food and fuel observed in Q1 of 2017-18 has, by and large, reversed. There is a risk that this upward trajectory may continue in the near-term. Second, the impact of HRA by the Central Government is expected to peak in December. The staggered impact of HRA increases by various state governments may push up housing inflation further in 2018, with attendant second order effects. Third, the recent rise in international crude oil prices may sustain, especially on account of the OPEC\u2019s decision to maintain production cuts through next year. In such a scenario, any adverse supply shock due to geo-political developments could push up prices even further. Despite recent increase in prices of vegetables, some seasonal moderation is expected in near months as winter arrivals kick in. Prices of pulses have continued to show a downward bias. The GST Council in its last meeting has brought several retail goods and services to lower tax brackets, which should translate into lower retail prices, going forward. On the whole, inflation is estimated in the range 4.3-4.7 per cent in Q3 and Q4 of this year, including the HRA effect of up to 35 basis points, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to GVA projections, Q2 growth was lower than that projected in the October 20. resolution. The recent increase in oil prices may have a negative impact on margins of firms and GVA growth. Shortfalls in kharif production and rabi sowing pose downside risks to the outlook for agriculture. On the positive side, there has been some pick up in credit growth in recent months. Recapitalisation of public sector banks may help improve credit flows further. While there has been weakness in some components of the services sector such as real estate, the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey indicates that the services and infrastructure sectors are expecting an improvement in demand, financial conditions and the overall business situation in Q4. Taking into account the above factors, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 of the October resolution at 6.7 per cent has been retained, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). The MPC notes that the evolving trajectory needs to be carefully monitored. First, two 21. of the key factors determining the cost of living conditions and inflation expectations, i.e., food and fuel inflation, edged up in November. Inflation expectations of households surveyed by the Reserve Bank have already firmed up and any increase in food and fuel prices may further harden these expectations. Second, rising input cost conditions as reflected in various surveys point towards higher risk of pass-through to retail prices in the near term. Third, implementation of farm loan waivers by select states, partial roll back of excise duty and VAT in the case of petroleum products, and decrease in revenue on account of reduction in GST rates for several goods and services may result in fiscal slippage with attendant implications for inflation. Fourth, global financial instability on account of the pace of/uncertainty over monetary policy normalisation in AEs and fiscal expansion in the US carry risks for inflation. The expected seasonal moderation in prices of vegetables, and fruits and the recent lowering of tax rates by the GST Council could mitigate upside pressures. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold. However, keeping in mind the output gap dynamics, the MPC decided to continue with the neutral stance and watch the incoming data carefully. The MPC remains committed to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. In the MPC\u2019s assessment, there have been several significant developments in the 22. recent period which augur well for growth prospects, going forward. First, capital raised from the primary capital market has increased significantly after several years of sluggish activity. As the capital raised is deployed to set up new projects, it will add to demand in the short run and boost the growth potential of the economy over the medium-term. Second, the improvement in the ease of doing business ranking should help sustain foreign direct investment in the economy. Third, large distressed borrowers are being referenced to the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) and public sector banks are being recapitalised, which should enhance allocative efficiency. However, the MPC notes that the impact of these factors can be buttressed by reducing the cost of domestic borrowings through improved transmission by banks of past monetary policy changes on outstanding loans. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya 23. and Dr. Urjit R. Patel were in favour of the monetary policy decision, while Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted for a policy rate reduction of 25 basis points. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by December 20, 2017. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on February 6 and 7, 2018. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.0 per cent Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Dr. Urjit R. Patel 25. Since the last review, headline inflation has inched up to 3.6 per cent. RBI\u2019s quarterly projections of CPI inflation (including HRA) are based on crude prices being US $ 60 per barrel. Uncertainty because of geopolitical events could push up the price of crude higher than this value. As the Phillips Curve for the economy shifts up because of increases in crude prices, this poses an upside risk to the medium term inflation target of 4 per cent. The increase in the wheat MSP by the government in October was the biggest increase 26. in the past five years (both in absolute terms as well as percentage terms). My own research (with co-authors) shows how such procurement \u201cshocks\u201d can lead to a wage-price spiral ending up in generalized inflation. Separately, using the KLEMS database, I find that average annual total factor productivity (TFP) growth in agriculture in India between 1980 to 2011 is close to 1 per cent, with a very mild upward sloping (HP filtered) trend throughout the period. Stagnant agricultural productivity combined with a lopsided temporal distribution of rain like last year makes the agriculture sector continually vulnerable to price pressures that need to be carefully watched. Having said this, I am comforted by the fact that cereal inflation is lower with favourable base effects going forward. Kharif rice production is also consistent with production in the last five years. Pulses continue to face deflationary pressures, although base effects will be unfavourable in coming months. I see the 3-month and 1-year ahead inflationary expectations as stable but with an uptick. With the coming winter season, there will possibly be the usual seasonal moderation in vegetables. Inflation, excluding food, fuel, and housing till date is constant around 4.1 per cent which is somewhat comforting. 27. Compared to the last review, various risks are materializing around inflation becoming generalized and need to be watched carefully. The positive co-movement between the output gap and inflation excluding food and fuel since 2010-11 suggests that a closing output gap will generate demand-pull pressures on inflation as growth revives. The conquest of Indian inflation is certainly not a done deal! As I mentioned in my last review, the weakness in growth drivers continues to worry 28. me. While both GVA and GDP growth rebounded after sequential declines over the last 5 quarters, the growth revival lacks animal spirits. Consumption, the main stay of the Indian economy, at 54 per cent, exhibits a declining share of GDP. Consumer confidence is the lowest since September 2013. There has been a reversal of the commodity price cycle. 6 Investment demand continues to be muted, despite a recent uptick in Q2 of 2017-18. While merchandise exports are likely to see a sustained recovery as GST disruptions fade, exports are far too volatile to be a reliable source of aggregate demand in the short term. The November 2017 PMI in services also turned into contraction mode. Various factors however bode well for the growth process (GST, favourable impact of global growth, incipient turn around in credit growth, pay commission, and bank recapitalization). More certainty on growth trends will be available in the next couple of months after the release of Advance GDP Estimates and the Union Budget, making it prudent to wait and watch. 29. today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Taking these considerations into account, I vote for a pause in the policy repo rate at 30. Inflation as measured by the CPI recorded an uptick since the previous meeting of the MPC in early October 2017. This rise was driven by higher food inflation (mainly vegetables and fruits) and fuel prices. The effect of an increase in House Rent Allowance and the lingering impact of the goods and services tax (GST) also contributed towards the pressure on inflation. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained steady at 4.6 per cent. 31. Going forward, upside risks include expectations of high international prices of crude oil due to OPEC\u2019s accord to extend production cuts till December 2018. The impact of House Rent Allowance and likely fiscal slippages may also continue to push inflation up. The seasonal decline in vegetable prices (especially onions and tomatoes) has also not yet materialised due to supply disruptions. Global financial instability on account of monetary policy normalisation in advanced economies also implies risks to inflation. Further, the latest round of RBI\u2019s Households Inflation Expectations Survey shows inflation expectations firming up for both three-month- and one-year-ahead horizons. The Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey shows that firms expect to pass on the increase in input prices to output prices. Offsetting factors include the reduction in GST rate of several commodities and services that may translate into lower retail prices for consumers, a more proactive supply management by the government, and a downward trend in prices of pulses. 32. India\u2019s GVA growth accelerated in Q2 2017-18 after five consecutive quarters of slowing down. Although agriculture and services decelerated, there was a rebound in industrial activity, partly due to restocking after GST implementation. 33. Going forward, the Reserve Bank\u2019s surveys indicate that performance in the services and infrastructure sectors is expected to improve in Q4 on account of increase in demand, financial conditions and the overall business situation. Further, recapitalization of public sector banks may help in sustaining the renewed credit flows. The recent reduction in GST rates may also provide a boost to the economy. The improvement in the ranking related to the ease of doing business may also provide an impetus to growth. In the coming months, downside risks to growth may arise from lower than projected sowing in the rabi season. Another major factor may be the recent increase in oil prices that will put pressure on margins of firms. The Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by RBI indicates deterioration in the outlook for the general economic situation and the employment scenario. Furthermore, growth in the Economic Cycle Research Institute\u2019s Indian Leading 34. Index, a predictor of future economic activity, has been lacklustre in recent months. 35. Thus, in the current scenario, a wait and watch strategy is recommended, with continuous monitoring of data. Hence, I vote for status quo in the policy rate and maintenance of the neutral stance. 36. I am not in agreement with the assessment of the RBI for both the CPI inflation and the economic growth prospects in the near term. I also do not share its over-concerns for the upside risks on inflation and over-optimism on economic growth front. In my opinion, the inflation situation is under reasonable control and is likely to remain well within the acceptable range during the foreseeable future because after a couple of months favourable base effects will set in. The real cause of concern right now is the economic recovery and its slow pace. Fiscal space is more or less exhausted but the space for the monetary boost has fortunately been available now for a relatively long period. Had the policy rate been cut to 5.75 per cent in June 2017 as I had argued then, the economic recovery would have been far more rapid and we would have been in a much better position. Although we have missed the bus, it is still better late than never. In my opinion, we must cut the policy rate by at least 25 basis points to begin with if we want to be on conservative side, because enough space existed all along. The specific reasons for my recommendation are as follows: i) Although the recent most round of RBI\u2019s household inflationary expectation survey shows an increase of about 60 basis points (bps) for inflation one year ahead, overall it shows a substantial decline of about 280 bps over the last year or so. A very consistent and more reliable result is obtained from the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) latest business expectation survey with more than 2100 responses that shows the headline CPI inflation expectation one year ahead to be 3.71 per cent \u2013 well below the RBI target of 4 per cent. The standard deviation for this estimate is also relatively low. Thus, inflationary expectations are very well anchored and inflation control does not seem to be a major issue in the near future, i.e. over next 6 to 12 months. ii) On the other hand, the RBI surveys show that consumer confidence on income, employment and overall economic environment is very low and declining in recent times. Companies still lack the pricing power and experience squeeze in their profit margins. iii) Better performing and financially sound companies according to the RBI surveys are investing more in financial assets than in physical assets. They behave more like savers than investors because the real rate of interest is too high to encourage long term investment. Even consumers would be discouraged to consume durable goods. It needs to be noted that the real rate of interest is the difference between nominal rate of interest and expected rate of inflation (and not the observed rate of inflation in the recent past). iv) Despite the marginal economic recovery, the capacity utilization in Indian industry according to the RBI surveys continues to be at low level of 72 per cent indicating persistent existence of output gap. Service sector PMI is also declining and in the pessimist zone. The growth recovery expectation of RBI during the June-September quarter of 2017 turned out to be a substantial overstatement. As against RBI\u2019s expectation of 6.4 per cent, the growth of real GVA during the quarter turned out to be only 6.1 per cent. Yet, the RBI has not revised its growth forecast from the earlier 6.7 percent for the year 2017-18. This implies that RBI now expects a higher growth of 7.0 and 7.8 per cent respectively in the third and fourth quarters of 2017-18. This is highly improbable to be achieved without any policy rate cut because fiscal space is practically non-existent and the conditions described in points (ii) to (iv) above are posing a big challenge. Expecting an unrealistically higher growth rates during the 3rd and 4th quarters creates a false hope of the output gap closing on its own in near future so as to continue with the policy inaction. vi) On the contrary, since the recovery has been slow and the confidence low, I expect the growth during the year 2017-18 to be much lower at only 6.4 per cent, which implies a growth rate of 6.7 and 7.2 per cent respectively for the 3rd and 4th quarters. Moreover, unlike my colleagues on the MPC, I firmly believe that the output gap would not start narrowing unless the current growth rate exceeds 8 \u2013 8.5 per cent. It means that, in my opinion, the output gap is going to expand till the middle of the next year. That, in itself, will put downward pressure on prices and neutralize several upside risks to inflation. Oil prices in my opinion are not likely to stay significantly higher than the current level for any longer time. Similarly, although the fiscal slippage is likely in percentage to GDP, it would not be substantial in absolute terms. The fiscal deficit as percentage of GDP may exceed the target because the nominal GDP would grow much slower than the assumed number (11.75 per cent) in the last budget on account of lower inflation and substantial slowdown in the real growth. However, the numerator that puts upward pressure on yield rates and prices is not likely to increase substantially in absolute terms and hence the inflationary impact would be limited. It is important to recognize that the RBI\u2019s expectation about the headline inflation in the remaining two quarters of 2017-18 is in the range of 4.3 to 4.7 per cent. If we exclude the pure statistical effect of revisions in the house rent allowance by the 7th Pay Commission for the government employees, the range of the RBI forecasts of both the headline and CPI excluding food and fuel show the relevant inflation rate hovering around 3.9 to 4.3 per cent over the rest of the year. Thus, there is a clear space for the rate reduction of at least 25 bps even without considering the output gap. There are serious implications of keeping the real policy rate substantially higher than most other countries in the world. Currently, only eleven countries in the world have a positive real policy rate and several of them either are in some crisis or have recently emerged out of a crisis. Among the rest of the countries, India has the highest real rate. If the situation is not corrected soon, it has the potential to destabilize the financial markets at home by discouraging domestic investments and encouraging foreign investment in the debt market. It may involve substantial risks for future. On the other hand, by cutting the policy rate, the domestic corporate bond market, stock market and hence investment demand could be encouraged and growth can be accelerated to bridge the output gap. 37. 2017. Keeping all these points in mind, I vote for a 25 bps cut in the policy rate in December I vote for status quo. 39. All the upside risks to inflation cited in previous resolutions are materialising. Moreover, price pressures are no more confined to vegetables alone, as in previous readings; they are getting diffused across petroleum products, services (excluding housing, which is being pulled up independently by statistical effects of the house rent allowance for central government employees), and into underlying inflation. The risks of inflation getting generalised appear to have increased to a point where they could potentially overwhelm the softening effects of winter arrivals of vegetables and fruits. Projections indicate that inflation prints are likely to stay above target from here on. 9 40. Households\u2019 inflation expectations have firmed up and are undermining consumer confidence. The pressure of input costs may soon force corporations to reflect them in selling prices as their margins get whittled down from absorbing these costs. Financial markets, especially the bond market segment, are scenting higher inflation in the air. The slosh of liquidity that marooned markets during the year so far is being steadily drained away by liquidity operations and a position of neutrality may emerge before the end of the financial year, abstracting maturing securities under the market stabilisation scheme and forex operations. The current phase of accommodation in the monetary policy stance \u2013 reduction of the 41. policy rate by 200 basis points - is one of the deepest barring the easing associated with the global financial crisis. Also, it has been more fully transmitted. In my view, this phase has matured; it is time now to signal its end and commence the withdrawal of accommodation, consistent with the evolving stance of liquidity management. 42. It is not that I am sanguine about growth; far from it. Rather than green shoots, my sense is that the upturn of Q2 occurred on the back of replenishment of inventories, and more incoming data are needed to tell us whether or not it is durable. The investment temper remains dormant, as evident in the persisting slump in the rate of capital formation. It awaits reforms that bite the bullet in terms of freeing up product and factor markets, removing barriers to entry and exit, and rekindling productivity and competitiveness all around. As growth regains solid ground, it could likely sustain inflation above the target. The time has come for monetary policy to take guard and be ready to go on to the 43. front foot. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya The global commodity cycle now seems to have turned with oil prices having also 44. rebounded recently. This has created significant input cost pressures in the economy, which at some stage may get passed on to retail prices. Vegetable prices have also firmed up, creating uncertainty around the extent of seasonal winter moderation in prices. These factors have put headline inflation on a trajectory that will most likely cross the MPC target rate of 4 per cent rather soon and remain above the target in the medium term (even after excluding the HRA impact). Oil price evolution remains a particular concern. The shale gas response 45. notwithstanding, improving global demand appears to be playing an important role in shaping oil prices along with the extension of OPEC\u2019s production cuts. This development poses difficult domestic policy challenges \u2013 countercyclical adjustment in cess would require fiscal balancing elsewhere, whereas lack of such adjustment would imply pressure on domestic inflation (temporarily latent, since the price pass-through at pumps has not been immediate). 46. The adverse change in overall terms of trade given the commodity cycle upturn has likely also weakened drivers of growth. Nevertheless, there has been some respite in the last quarter\u2019s growth prints as well as some of the high frequency indicators of real economic activity in recent months. Our research team\u2019s output gap estimates show some closure, attributable in part to improved credit growth and overall flow of financial resources to the commercial sector. 47. Output gap remains somewhat negative as reflected in present low capacity utilisation and high inventory. However, gradually improving credit metrics in several distressed sectors should pave way for improved investment over the next year. This process is expected to be further supported as cases referenced to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) resolve, facilitate consolidation, and restore pricing power. As public sector banks raise capital, 10 receive recapitalisation from the government, and undertake reforms, credit flows to productive sectors of the economy should improve. 48. There seems little scope for accommodation or for change of stance at the present juncture. Hence, I vote to keep the repo rate at 6 per cent with neutral stance. Incoming data will be key to shape the policy going forward. I remain keen to (i) understand the impact of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on price levels as its rollout stabilises; (ii) assess in coming months the robustness of growth revival in GVA manufacturing; and (iii) track the impact of commodity prices on the Indian economy and markets. In parallel, the Reserve Bank is examining options to improve the transmission of its policy rate actions from banks to borrowers. Statement by Dr. Urjit R. Patel 49. The inflation scenario has evolved by and large along anticipated lines even as there was some unexpected firming up of food prices in October. (I say by and large because prints have been volatile throughout the year.) Inflation is now projected to be marginally higher, going forward, as the recent increase in oil prices is likely to sustain. Food inflation, led by vegetables, remains highly variable, while deflation in pulses continues. The impact of higher house rent allowance (HRA) of central government employees on housing inflation will peak in December. 50. There are several risks to the projected inflation trajectory. First, inflation expectations of households for both three-month ahead and one-year ahead periods in the latest round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey moved up. The percentage of households expecting inflation to rise at a faster rate than the current level was the highest since end-2013. Second, rising input cost pressures across the board for both manufacturing and services have raised the risk of pass-through to output prices, especially because the growth momentum is projected to gain strength in the second half of the year. Third, fiscal slippage concerns linger on. Should this risk materialise, it would have implications for the inflation outlook. These risks to the inflation trajectory could, however, be alleviated to some extent by the expected seasonal moderation in vegetable prices and the pass-through of recent reduction in GST rates on certain goods and services to retail prices. 51. The acceleration in GVA growth in Q2:2017-18 (as projected in October) is comforting, especially because it was underpinned by a sharp increase in manufacturing. Growth in gross capital formation continued to recover. Going forward, lower rabi sowing and lower reservoir level pose a downside risk to agriculture activity. However, on the industrial front, the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey points to an improvement in manufacturing sector business expectations in Q3. Various indicators of service sector activity, however, present a mixed picture. Financial conditions have improved significantly in the recent period as reflected in large capital raised from the primary capital market and a pick-up in bank credit growth. These perhaps may be indicating a long-awaited (modest) upturn in an investment cycle. 52. The macroeconomic situation has remained broadly unchanged since the last MPC meeting in October 2017. However, the recent upturn in crude oil prices has emerged as a source of concern. Several uncertainties, especially on the fiscal and external fronts, persist. It is, therefore, important to be vigilant. Hence, I vote for status quo in the policy rate, while maintaining the stance as neutral; this allows us the flexibility to respond appropriately to incoming data. Jose J. Kattoor Press Release : 2017-2018/1691 Chief General Manager ", "file8": "The ninth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on February 6 and 7, 2018 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:\u2013 (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the in detail staff\u2019s projections of professional macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. forecasters. The MPC also reviewed 5. at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s last meeting in December 2017, global economic activity has gained further pace with growth impulses becoming more synchronised across regions. Among advanced economies (AEs), the Euro area expanded at a robust pace, supported by consumption and investment. Economic optimism alongside falling unemployment and low interest rates are supporting the recovery. The US economy lost some momentum with growth slowing down in Q4 of 2017 even as manufacturing activity touched a multi-month high in December. The Japanese economy continued to grow as manufacturing activity gathered pace in January on strong external demand, providing fillip to the already bullish business confidence. Economic activity accelerated in emerging market economies (EMEs) in the final 7. quarter of 2017. The Chinese economy grew above the official target, driven by strong domestic consumption and robust exports. However, some downside risks to growth remain, especially from easing fixed asset investment and surging debt levels. In Russia, strong private consumption, rising oil prices and high exports are supporting economic activity, although weak investment and economic sanctions are weighing on its growth prospects. In Brazil, data on household spending and unemployment were positive in Q4. However, recovery remains vulnerable to political uncertainty, which has dampened consumer confidence. South Africa continues to face challenges on both domestic and external fronts, including high unemployment and declining factory activity. 8. Global trade continued to expand, underpinned by strong investment and robust manufacturing activity. Crude oil prices touched a three-year high as production cuts by the OPEC coupled with falling inventories weighed on the global demand-supply balance. Bullion prices touched a multi-month high on a weak US dollar. Inflation remained contained in most AEs, barring the UK, on subdued wage pressures. Inflation was divergent in key EMEs due to country-specific factors. 9. Financial markets have become volatile in recent days due to uncertainty over the pace of normalisation of the US Fed monetary policy in view of January payrolls data showing rapidly accelerating wage growth and better than expected employment. The volatility index (VIX) has climbed to its highest level since Brexit. Equity markets have witnessed a sharp correction, both in AEs and EMEs. Bond yields in the US have hardened sharply, adding to the upward pressures seen during January, with concomitant rise in bond yields in other AEs and EMEs. Forex markets have become volatile as well. Until this episode of recent volatility, global financial markets were buoyed by investor appetite for risk, corporate tax cuts by the US, and stable economic conditions. Equity markets had gained significantly in January, driven by robust Chinese growth, uptick in commodity prices, and positive corporate sentiment in general. In currency markets, the US dollar had touched a multi-month low on February 1 on fiscal risks and improving growth prospects in other AEs. 10. On the domestic front, the real gross value added (GVA) growth as per the first advance estimates (FAE) released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) is estimated to decelerate to 6.1 per cent in 2017-18 from 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 due mainly to slowdown in agriculture and allied activities, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, and public administration and defence (PADO) services. 11. Information available after the release of FAE by the CSO has, however, been generally positive. Manufacturing output boosted the growth of index of industrial production (IIP) in November. After a period of prolonged weakness, cement production registered robust growth in November-December, which along with continuing healthy growth in steel production led to acceleration of infrastructure goods production in November. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) expanded for the sixth consecutive month in January led by new orders. Assessment of overall business sentiment in the Indian manufacturing sector improved in Q3 as reflected in the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook to Survey contraction/deceleration in production of coal, crude oil, steel and electricity. Acreage in the case of wheat, oilseeds and coarse cereals was lower than last year. As a result, the shortfall in area sown for rabi crops increased to (-) 1.5 per cent as on February 2 as compared with (- ) 1.0 per cent on December 29, 2017. (IOS). However, core sector growth decelerated 12. In the services sector, some of the high frequency indicators improved. Commercial vehicle sales growth touched an eight-year high in December. Cargo carried by sea, rail and air also registered higher growth in November, but showed mixed performance in December. Other indicators such as domestic and international air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals grew at a fast pace in November-December. The services PMI expanded sequentially in December and January on the back of higher business activity. Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the consumer price index 13. (CPI), increased for the sixth consecutive month in December on account of a strong unfavourable base effect. After rising abruptly in November, food prices reversed partly in December, reflecting mainly the seasonal moderation, albeit muted, in prices of vegetables along with continuing decline in prices of pulses. Cereals inflation moderated with prices remaining steady in December. However, inflation in some components of food \u2013 eggs; meat and fish; oils and fats; and milk \u2013 increased. Fuel and light group inflation, which showed a sharp increase in November, softened somewhat in December, driven by moderation in electricity, LPG and kerosene inflation. 14. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel increased further in November and December, largely on account of increase in housing inflation following the implementation of higher house rent allowances (HRA) for government employees under the 7th central pay commission (CPC) award. Inflation also picked up in health and personal care and effects. Reflecting incomplete pass-through to domestic petroleum product prices, inflation in transport and communication remained muted in December. Inflation also slowed down in clothing and footwear, household goods and services, recreation, and education. 15. Households\u2019 inflation expectations, measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of households, remained elevated for both three-month ahead and one-year ahead horizons even as inflation expectation for one-year ahead horizon moderated marginally. Firms responding to the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) continued to report input price pressures and increase in selling prices in Q3. This is also confirmed by manufacturing and services firms polled by PMI. Organised sector wage growth remained firm, while the rural wage growth decelerated. 16. The liquidity in the system continues to be in surplus mode, but it is moving steadily towards neutrality. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded 12 basis points (bps) below the repo rate during December-January as against 15 bps below the repo rate in November. On some days in December and January, the system turned into deficit due to slow down in government spending and large tax collections, which necessitated injection of liquidity by the Reserve Bank. During the two weeks beginning December 16, 2017, the Reserve Bank injected average daily net liquidity of \u20b9 388 billion into the system. For December as a whole, however, the Reserve Bank absorbed \u20b9 316 billion (on a net daily average basis). As the system turned into deficit again in the fourth week of January, the Reserve Bank injected average net liquidity of \u20b9 145 billion. For January, on the whole, the Reserve Bank absorbed \u20b9 353 billion (on a net daily average basis). 17. Merchandise exports bounced back in November and December. While petroleum products, engineering goods and chemicals accounted for three-fourths of this growth, exports of readymade garments contracted. During the same period, merchandise import growth accelerated sequentially with over one-third of the growth emanating from petroleum (crude and products) due largely to high international prices. Gold imports increased \u2013 both in value and volume terms \u2013 in December, after declining in the preceding three months. Pearls and precious stones, electronic goods and coal were major contributors to non-oil non-gold import growth. With import growth exceeding export growth, the trade deficit for December was US$ 14.9 billion. 18. Even though the current account deficit narrowed sharply in Q2 of 2017-18 on a sequential basis, it was higher than its level a year ago, mainly due to widening of the trade deficit. While net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows moderated in April-October 2017 from their level a year ago, net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows were buoyant in 2017-18 (up to February 1). India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 421.9 billion on February 2, 2018. The December bi-monthly resolution projected inflation in the range of 4.3-4.7 per 19. cent in the second half of 2017-18, including the impact of increase in HRA. In terms of actual outcomes, headline inflation averaged 4.6 per cent in Q3, driven primarily by an unusual pick-up in food prices in November. Though prices eased in December, the winter seasonal food price moderation was less than usual. Domestic pump prices of petrol and diesel rose sharply in January, reflecting lagged pass-through of the past increases in international crude oil prices. Considering these factors, inflation is now estimated at 5.1 per cent in Q4, including the HRA impact. 20. The inflation outlook beyond the current year is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, international crude oil prices have firmed up sharply since August 2017, driven by both demand and supply side factors. Second, non-oil industrial raw material prices have also witnessed a global uptick. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s IOS expect input prices to harden in Q4. In a scenario of improving economic activity, rising input costs are likely to be passed on to consumers. Third, the inflation outlook will depend on the monsoon, which is assumed to be normal. Taking these factors into consideration, CPI inflation for 2018-19 is estimated in the range of 5.1-5.6 per cent in H1, including diminishing statistical HRA impact of central government employees, and 4.5-4.6 per cent in H2, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). The projected moderation in inflation in the second half is on account of strong favourable base effects, including unwinding of the 7th CPC\u2019s HRA impact, and a softer food the assumption of normal monsoon and effective supply forecast, given inflation management by the Government. 21. Turning to the growth outlook, GVA growth for 2017-18 is projected at 6.6 per cent. Beyond the current year, the growth outlook will be influenced by several factors. First, GST implementation is stabilising, which augurs well for economic activity. Second, there are early signs of revival in investment activity as reflected in improving credit offtake, large resource mobilisation from the primary capital market, and improving capital goods production and imports. Third, the process of recapitalisation of public sector banks has got underway. Large distressed borrowers are being referenced for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). This should improve credit flows further and create demand for fresh investment. Fourth, although export growth is expected to improve further on account of improving global demand, elevated commodity prices, especially of oil, may act as a drag on aggregate demand. Taking into consideration the above factors, GVA growth for 2018-19 is projected at 7.2 per cent overall \u2013 in the range of 7.3-7.4 per cent in H1 and 7.1-7.2 per cent in H2 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). 22. The MPC notes that the inflation outlook is clouded by several uncertainties on the upside. First, the staggered impact of HRA increases by various state governments may push up headline inflation further over the baseline in 2018-19, and potentially induce second-round effects. Second, a pick-up in global growth may exert further pressure on crude oil and commodity prices with implications for domestic inflation. Third, the Union Budget 2018-19 has proposed revised guidelines for arriving at the minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops, although the exact magnitude of its impact on inflation cannot be fully assessed at this stage. Fourth, the Union Budget has also proposed an increase in customs duty on a number of items. Fifth, fiscal slippage as indicated in the Union Budget could impinge on the inflation outlook. Apart from the direct impact on inflation, fiscal slippage has broader macro-financial implications, notably on economy-wide costs of borrowing which have already started to rise. This may feed into inflation. Sixth, the confluence of domestic fiscal developments and normalisation of monetary policy by major advanced economies could further adversely impact financing conditions and undermine the confidence of external investors. There is, therefore, need for vigilance around the evolving inflation scenario in the coming months. 23. There are also mitigating factors. First, capacity utilisation remains subdued. Second, oil prices have moved both ways in the recent period and can potentially soften from current levels based on production response. Third, rural real wage growth is moderate. 24. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and continue with the neutral stance. The MPC reiterates its commitment to keep headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. 25. The MPC notes that the economy is on a recovery path, including early signs of a revival of investment activity. Global demand is improving, which should help strengthen domestic investment activity. The focus of the Union Budget on the rural and infrastructure sectors is also a welcome development as it would support rural incomes and investment, and in turn provide a further push to aggregate demand and economic activity. On the downside, the deterioration in public finances risks crowding out of private financing and investment. The Committee is of the view that the nascent recovery needs to be carefully nurtured and growth put on a sustainably higher path through conducive and stable macro- financial management. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and 26. Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra voted for an increase in the policy rate of 25 basis points. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by February 21, 2018. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on April 4 and 5, 2018. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.0 per cent Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Dr. Urjit R. Patel 28. Since the last review, there has been a sharp increase in headline inflation (November, 4.9%; December, 5.2%). The latest reading is, worryingly, led by rising inflation in all major groups. Both food and fuel inflation have also increased, with the usual seasonal easing in food inflation getting delayed till December. Global demand \u2013 with world GDP projected to grow at approximately 3.9% in 2018 \u2013 could push oil prices higher. All measures of inflation have converged above 5%. Adverse supply side shocks could push the Phillips curve of the economy upward posing a strong risk to the medium-term inflation target of 4%. Inflation, excluding food and fuel (December, 5.2%) is up although this is primarily 29. due to the statistical boost from Centre\u2019s HRA. Pricing decisions by firms may possibly be responding more to the recent increases in input costs, driven by a reversal of the international commodity cycle, rather than staff costs, driven by a tightening of the labour market, or higher capacity utilisation. This suggests that inflation excluding food and fuel may be increasing more because of cost-push factors, which will worsen the growth-inflation trade-off. There are fewer mitigating factors to rising inflation compared to two months ago. 30. Rural wage growth continues to be moderate but with an uptick, possibly reflecting a rise in construction activity. The deflation in pulses continues but could reverse with the new procurement policy announced in the Union Budget of 2018-2019. At the current juncture though, stripped of cereals and vegetables (volatile items), the increase in inflation net of volatile items, from its trough in June 2017, is less pronounced. Both 3-month and 1-year ahead inflationary expectations are also stable. 31. In my last review, I had flagged how increases in MSP by the government could lead to generalized inflation, and worsen monetary transmission, based on research (with co- authors). While details on the exact procurement policy are awaited, the enactment of a more elaborate procurement policy in the 2018-2019 Union Budget will put stress on state finances as well. Fiscal slippages in India are inflationary! 32. With respect to economic growth, data trends have largely been positive in the last few months, as suggested by many high frequency indicators. My main concern in the last few reviews was whether animal spirits in the economy will sustain GDP growth beyond the base effect induced increases in Q3 and Q4 2017-2018. This looks increasingly likely. 33. Profit margins in the manufacturing sector are improving, with sales being higher in real terms. The PMI in services increased in December and January. The RBI enterprise surveys also suggest a substantial improvement in demand conditions. Several high frequency activity indicators have picked up suggesting that the growth deceleration has troughed. The flow of financial resources by banks and non-banks is also picking up. It is highly possible however that current growth trends will make the economy accelerate into an inflationary phase. This needs to be watched with laser-like precision. 34. Ultimately, any durable increase in growth in GDP however will depend on investment demand. The figure below, using the KLEMS database, plots growth in output per worker against growth in capital stock per worker between 1980 and 2011. While the figure is merely suggestive, it does indicate that output per worker has tracked capital per worker fairly closely during this period, suggesting dynamics in output per worker in India in the medium term are described reasonably well by a Solow-Swan style model. Any durable increase in output per worker will only come about by increases in capital per worker. To that extent, the recent uptick in investment/GDP ratio is encouraging. 35. today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Taking these considerations into account, I vote for a pause in the policy repo rate at 36. CPI inflation continued its upward trajectory in November and December 2017, climbing to a 17 month high of 5.2% in December, partly due to an unfavourable base effect. This increase was also driven by an increase in food prices, along with inflation in fuel due to a rise in global crude prices. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel also increased in December, partly due to housing inflation driven by the effects of house rent allowance for government employees under the 7th central pay commission. Going forward, several upside risks to inflation remain. These include the possibility of 37. an increase in global commodity prices and higher crude oil prices. Fiscal deficit slippage and the slower than expected fiscal consolidation as well as the staggered impact of house rent allowance by state governments may also exert pressure on inflation. The proposal in the Budget to link the minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops with 1.5 times the cost of production, may also drive inflation up, although its impact cannot be ascertained as yet. The Union Budget has also proposed an increase in customs duty on several items. Further, the Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) of the RBI suggests hardening of input prices which may be passed on to the consumers and lead to higher CPI inflation. Households\u2019 inflation expectations, as per RBI\u2019s survey of households, remain high for both three-month-ahead and one-year-ahead forecast horizons. Meanwhile, the Indian Future Inflation Gauge, a harbinger of inflation (constructed by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, with which the author is affiliated), has increased in recent months, indicating an uptick in inflation pressures. 38. At the same time, positive signs of economic growth are visible. To begin with, the implementation of the GST is stabilising. Other positive factors include the recapitalisation of public sector banks and steps towards NPA resolution under the insolvency and bankruptcy code. Credit growth has also increased in December. Steps have also been taken in the Union Budget to revive economic activity, with a focus on rural and infrastructure sectors. However, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Index, a predictor of future economic 39. activity, has eased lately, indicating fading economic growth prospects, Also, ECRI\u2019s international leading indexes suggest that global growth will ease this year. Moreover, with growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Exports Index, which anticipates the direction of exports growth, staying subdued, the Indian export growth outlook remains restrained. 40. There is also concern about global financial market volatility against the backdrop of rising global bond yields and uncertainty regarding the normalisation of monetary policy by major advanced economies. 41. Thus, with upside risks to inflation and lacklustre growth prospects, a wait and watch strategy with status quo in policy interest rate and a neutral stance is currently recommended. 42. Developments on inflation and growth fronts since the last meeting of MPC in December 2017 have been more or less on expected lines. Although the headline inflation was expected to rise in November and December 2017, the extent of increase was higher than I expected. However, it is likely to decline during the next 3-4 months on account of favourable base effect and seasonal factors. The expectation about recovery in the growth of GVA remained subdued in the Economic Survey 2017-18 in line with what I had anticipated in my statement in the last meeting of MPC. Capacity utilisation continues to be stubborn at around 72 per cent reflecting continued presence of excess capacity in manufacturing sectors. As I have been arguing, the output gap continues to be negative and expanding. Inflation expectations of households 12 months ahead show marginal decline over the previous round in spite of the headline inflation sharply picking up during the survey period. The latest Business Inflation Expectation Survey (BIES) conducted by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) with more than 2500 respondents finds that their expectation about costs 12 months ahead has risen by 40 basis points but still remains at 3.7 per cent. Even the RBI\u2019s forecast of the headline inflation 12 months ahead is around 4.5- 4.6 per cent. 43. However, inflation trends need to be watched carefully. Although the base effects are going to be favorable over the next 3-4 months, the oil price movements can create uncertainties and serious upside risks. The fiscal space to accommodate future higher oil price shocks seems to be absent given the slippage in the Union budget for 2018-19. Impact of the increase in customs duty and MSP proposed in the budget on the headline inflation is again uncertain. Although there is substantial fiscal slippage by the Centre, the fiscal performance of major states needs to be watched. Their revenues are now more certain and the Centre has provided for an increased transfer of tax revenues to states by 0.2 percentage points of GDP in the budget. As a result, the fiscal discipline by states is a critical factor to watch \u2013 whether it compounds or compensates for the fiscal indiscipline of the Centre. Moreover, the implementation of the HRA revisions by states and other bodies like universities and its likely impact on the headline inflation is again uncertain though its primary effect is only statistical. 44. Under all these uncertainties and conflicting trends, prudence lies in following the policy of wait and watch and allow clearer picture to emerge. Hence, I vote for maintaining the status quo on both the policy rate and neutral stance. 45. In April last year, I expressed a preference for a pre-emptive policy rate increase, sensing that inflation is rising out of the demonetisation trough. I voted, however, for holding the rate unchanged through the June and August meetings to allow transitory effects to fully pass. My vote for status quo was maintained in August even though the Committee by majority decision reduced the policy rate by 25 basis points in that meeting. 46. By the October meeting, my stance had been vindicated. Looking ahead, I saw inflation stripped of house rent allowance effects exceeding the target by the end of the year. Worrying that a vicious spiral could be developing \u2013 input costs; domestic prices of petroleum products; inflation expectations \u2013 as the slowdown in growth troughed and geared to pick up in the second half of the year, I provided specific forward guidance. 47. My vote for status quo was conditioned to inflation staying within the target, with a readiness to raise the policy rate if inflation drivers strengthen. By the December meeting, the time had come to take guard, bringing to critical mass my stance articulated since April. 48. Circling back to the present, several drivers of inflation are firing at the same time \u2013 upward adjustments of domestic POL prices in response to the hardening of international crude prices, including catching up with withheld pass-through; imminent MSP increases; fiscal slippage; customs duty increases. Various measures of underlying inflation are converging to the headline at above 5 per cent. Expectations are elevated and volatile. Fixed income markets are telling us that we have fallen behind the curve. 49. In the near term outlook (up to mid-2018), inflation is likely to drift well above target. It is important to recognise that the expected easing of inflation in the outer months of the forecast horizon \u2013 between July 2018 and March 2019 \u2013 is largely statistical as the HRA effect wanes. The target is in danger of getting out of reach and over the next few months, the upper tolerance band is under threat. This could seriously dent the credibility of the Committee\u2019s commitment to the target. 50. Turning to the state of the economy, a turnaround has likely begun in the third quarter of 2017-18 \u2013 sales are accelerating even as inventories are being drawn down; the capex cycle is starting up; and pricing power is returning. External demand is providing support as exports grow at ASEAN rates. Accelerating growth in non oil non bullion imports is reflecting domestic demand, including substitution effects, impatient with the sluggishness in the supply response. 51. The output gap is starting to turn up from a persistently negative state. If the professional forecasters\u2019 consensus around 7 per cent plus growth for 2018-19 materialises, the output gap is expected to close going forward. 52. If the statistical reversal of the HRA effect is looked through, the real policy rate is below 1 per cent and could fall further absent policy action. This is completely misaligned with underlying fundamentals and the economy's prospects at a time when activity is picking up. In view of the prolonged period of status quo, a series of rate increases may be warranted to remove excessive accommodation. The time to begin is upon us. I vote for an increase of 25 basis points in the policy rate to commence the withdrawal 53. of accommodation. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 54. Headline inflation prints since last policy have been significantly above the target. While a part of this is statistical due to the Centre's HRA implementation, there has also been a rise in inflation sans HRA. A major concern has been the steep rise in oil prices coincidentally with (i) global rates and commodity cycles having turned up; and (ii) our fiscal deficit having overshot for this year and likely to do so next year too. Hence, even without factoring in the States\u2019 staggered HRA implementation and MSP rises announced in the Union Budget, risks to inflation seem clearly tilted on the upside. Indeed, RBI's projections at 12-14 months in future put headline inflation by more than 50 basis points above the target (by then the statistical effect of Centre\u2019s HRA implementation would have completely waned). 55. Such an inflation scenario would imply a raise in policy rates by a pure inflation- targeting central bank, in turn, implying a change in stance from \"neutral\" to \"withdrawal of accommodation.\" However, two reasons induced me to pause. 56. First, an important factor determining inflation going forward is likely to be the shale gas production response to rising oil prices; while this response has been somewhat muted, its trigger out of dormancy could dampen oil prices swiftly. I would like to see whether this downside risk plays out in next few months to have a firmer grip on the medium-term inflation trajectory. Second, for a flexible inflation targeting framework, the growth trajectory relative to 57. potential output has to be considered too. On this front, the output gap remains somewhat negative though it has been steadily 58. the banking system post improving balance sheets of closing. Structurally, recapitalisation package and the ongoing resolution of large stressed accounts have made the recent pick up in credit growth more sustainable. Real economic activity indicators also suggest a broad-based growth revival. While RBI growth projections for next year are in line with this buoyant activity of late, the recovery is nevertheless nascent and worthy of some support in the short run. 59. Given these trade-offs, I vote for a pause with no change in the neutral stance. The next few months of inflation and growth data will be key to determining the evolution of policy rates. If growth remains robust and inflation prints continue to project headline inflation a year ahead well above the target, then a change in stance from \"neutral\" to \"withdrawal of accommodation\" might have to be considered. In the meantime, it would be good to focus on (i) pushing forward the work we have 60. undertaken in improving the transmission of policy rate changes to the real sector; and (ii) taking the resolution framework for stressed assets to its logical conclusion. 61. CPI inflation rose for the sixth consecutive month in December. Food inflation increased further even as pulses continued to deflate. Fuel group inflation rose sharply in November and remained elevated thereafter. With rising input prices, inflation is getting increasingly generalised. Inflation expectations have remained elevated. Looking forward, inflation in the baseline scenario is projected to remain above the 62. target of 4 per cent throughout 2018-19. There are several upside risks to inflation, especially from the staggered impact of HRA increases by various state governments (the direct effect on the CPI of the pure statistical adjustment has to be looked through, but not the second round effects driven by, say, expectations); policy for arriving at the minimum support prices for Kharif crops; and the fiscal slippage as indicated in the Union Budget, which also has attendant \u201ccrowding-out\u201d implications with regard to the cost of private domestic credit. The evolving global macro backdrop is a concern. Tighter monetary policy by systemically important central banks, viz., the US Federal Reserve, combined with a looser US fiscal policy stance has the potential to imbue financial turbulence with concomitant consequences, especially for emerging markets. International crude oil prices increased significantly between December and early February, which is worrisome. However, oil prices could moderate if there is a strong supply response. Effective supply management by the government, as in the recent past, could help in keeping food inflation under check. Further, overall capacity utilisation in industry, according to surveys, is restrained. 63. Domestic economic growth impulses are strengthening. Manufacturing activity has picked up. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) expanded for the sixth consecutive month in January, led by new orders. There are also early signs of revival of investment activity. Many service sector indicators have shown robust growth such as commercial vehicle sales, domestic & international air passenger traffic, and foreign tourist arrivals. The services PMI expanded sequentially in December and January, supported by higher business activity. Credit growth is picking up and is also becoming broad-based. GVA growth in 2018-19 is forecast at 7.2 per cent, which will be a significant improvement over the current year. 64. Although inflation risks have increased in recent months, incoming data should provide greater clarity about the persistence of inflationary pressures. The economic recovery is also at a nascent stage and calls for a cautious approach at this juncture. I, therefore, vote for keeping the policy repo rate on hold while maintaining a neutral stance. ", "file9": "The tenth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held on April 4 and 5, 2018 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve 3. Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:\u2013 (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation1 at its 5. meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s last meeting in February 2018, global economic activity has gathered further momentum, both in advanced and emerging market economies, though financial market volatility and potential trade wars pose a threat to the outlook. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy, which ended 2017 on a slightly weak note, appeared to have bounced back in Q1:2018; the unemployment rate remains low with hiring around multi-month highs. In the Euro Area, economic activity remained buoyant, although consumer spending and factory activity slowed down due to the strengthening of the euro, but a consistently falling unemployment rate and elevated consumer confidence continued to underpin the strength of the economy. The Japanese economy registered eight straight quarters of growth till Q4:2017; available data for 2018 point to a slower start to the year with weak machinery orders and an easing manufacturing Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index (PMI) in February-March. Economic activity remained robust in emerging market economies (EMEs) in Q1:2018. 7. The Chinese economy started the year on a strong note; retail sales picked up pace indicating robust consumption, while industrial production also registered a strong increase in Q1:2018 on improved mining and manufacturing activity. In Brazil, economic activity is gaining momentum, driven by higher commodity prices. The Russian economy continued to recover in Q1; industrial production expanded in January-February, after two months of contraction, while exports grew at a robust pace. In South Africa, leading indicators, viz., the manufacturing PMI and business confidence, improved in Q1. 8. World trade volume growth is expected to have been robust in Q1, as gauged from the data on container trade throughput, air freight and export orders. Crude oil prices have become volatile in the recent period. After softening in February from multi-year highs on increased production in the US, crude prices hardened in the second half of March, driven by rebalancing of supply by OPEC and Russia, and drawdown of US inventories. Metal prices have come under selling pressure, with copper touching a three-month low in March on uncertainty stemming from global trade protectionism and US monetary policy. Gold prices, which touched a two- 1 From this resolution onwards, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will be used as the headline measure of economic activity. month low in March, have recently witnessed some uptick on fears of intensification of a trade war. Inflation remains below target in many key AEs and EMEs. 9. Financial markets turned volatile in February-March, triggered by uncertainty regarding the pace of normalisation of US monetary policy, and concerns surrounding global trade. Equity markets globally have shed most of the gains of the previous quarter in a heavy sell off in February-March, caused by optimistic US job reports and the US imposition of new tariffs on Chinese goods. Yields in the US traded sideways on weaker than expected inflation pressures and the anticipated rate hike by the Fed. Yields in other major AEs have fallen, while among EMEs, they have remained divergent on country-specific factors. In currency markets, the US dollar, which recovered somewhat in early March on an optimistic outlook of the economy, shed most of its gains in the latter part of the month on a less hawkish stance of the Fed and on anxieties surrounding a possible trade war. Among other major currencies, the euro continued to appreciate on an improving growth outlook for the region. Most EME currencies have retreated in the wake of the recent market volatility and the improving US economic outlook, though investors continued to discriminate on country-specific factors. 10. Turning to the domestic economy, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its second advance estimates for 2017-18 on February 28, revising India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth marginally upward to 6.6 per cent from 6.5 per cent in the first advance estimates released on January 5. GDP growth in 2017-18 at 6.6 per cent was lower than 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 and the deceleration was broad-based, but each component revealed intra-year turning points. Private consumption growth \u2013 whose contribution to GDP growth in 2017-18 was 68 per cent \u2013 moderated in the second half. Goods and services tax (GST) implementation had an adverse, even if transient, effect on urban consumption through loss of output and employment in the labour-intensive unorganised sector. Government expenditure provided sustained support to aggregate demand, with a pick-up in pace in the second half. Gross fixed capital formation turned around in Q2 and accelerated in the second half \u2013 markedly so in Q3 \u2013 reflecting the first signs of a sustained expansion in capital goods production and a modest revival of construction activity. Net exports dragged down aggregate demand in 2017-18 due to a surge in imports and deceleration in exports in Q3, the latter being driven in part by GST-related working capital disruptions. 11. For Q4, high frequency indicators point to a further strengthening of demand conditions. Private consumption seems to be improving on the back of strong growth in domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals, rising sales growth of passenger vehicles and a strong upturn in the production of consumer durables. The growth in sales of two-wheelers and tractors reflects buoyant rural consumption. Capital goods production registered a 19-month high growth in January 2018, indicative of the likely traction in investment demand. Housing loans extended by banks have increased significantly, which is a positive for residential investment. External demand remains a weak link. Merchandise import growth has slowed because of gold imports; simultaneously export growth has also weakened. 12. Turning to the supply side at a disaggregated sectoral level, the kharif foodgrains production for 2017-18 has been revised upward by 2.8 per cent in the second advance estimates released in February 2018 as compared with the first advance estimates released in September 2017. Total foodgrains production for 2017-18 is estimated at 277.5 million tonnes, up by 0.9 per cent from the level of 2016-17, with the production of rice, pulses and coarse cereals estimated to reach a record high. Wheat production is estimated to be lower than last year due to a decline in 3 acreage and low soil moisture, but imports of 1.6 million tonnes and comfortable buffer stocks should cushion potential adverse effects. Horticulture production touched a new peak of 305.4 million tonnes in 2017-18, up by 1.6 per cent from last year. For the year 2017-18 as a whole, the CSO estimates that value added in industry 13. decelerated in relation to the previous year; in terms of quarterly performance, however, expansion set in by Q2 and was built upon in Q3 and Q4. This was mainly driven by the rebound in manufacturing. The manufacturing PMI remained in an expansionary mode for the eighth consecutive month in March, although there was some moderation in Q4. Assessment of overall business sentiment for manufacturing also improved in Q4 as reflected in the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey, driven by increasing output and new orders. Growth of value added in the services sector accelerated through the year, driven by trade, hotels, transport and communication and a significant pick-up in construction activity. Other high frequency indicators of services sector activity such as domestic air passenger traffic, international freight traffic, port traffic and commercial vehicles sales also expanded at a fair pace. The services PMI moved out of contraction and stabilised in March on a renewed increase in new business and strengthening expectations. 14. Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, fell from a high of 5.1 per cent in January to 4.4 per cent in February due to a decline in inflation in food and fuel. Excluding the estimated impact of an increase in the house rent allowances (HRA) for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission (CPC), the headline inflation for February was at 4.1 per cent. Food inflation declined by 120 bps in February, pulled down by a sharp decline in vegetable prices, especially of onions and tomatoes, along with continuing deflation in pulses. The fall in prices was also observed in other food components such as eggs, sugar, meat and fish, oils, spices, cereals and milk. In the fuel and light group, inflation in respect of liquefied petroleum gas declined in line 15. with international price movements. Furthermore, the rate of increase in prices of firewood and chips, and dung cake moderated. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained unchanged at 5.2 per cent for the third 16. consecutive month in February, after rising from its trough in June 2017. Among its constituents, housing group inflation rose significantly, reflecting the HRA increase for central government employees. Excluding the HRA impact, inflation in this group was estimated markedly lower at 4.4 per cent. Inflation in the transport and communication group increased in February on account of the rise in petroleum product prices and transportation fares. Inflation either eased or remained at a low level in February in other major sub-groups such as household goods and services, recreation and amusement, education, and personal care and effects. 17. Households\u2019 inflation expectations, measured by the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of households, edged up for both three-month and one-year ahead horizons. Manufacturing firms covered in the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey reported input price pressures and an increase in selling prices in Q4:2017-18, which are expected to continue in Q1:2018-19. Manufacturing and services firms polled by PMI also showed a rise in input and output prices in Q4. Liquidity in the system moved between surplus and deficit during February-March 2018. 18. From a daily net average surplus of \u20b9 272 billion during February 1-11, 2018, liquidity moved into deficit during February 12-March 1, reflecting a slowdown in government spending and large tax collections. After turning into surplus during March 2-15, the system moved into deficit again during March 16-22 mainly on account of quarterly advance tax outflows. Anticipating the seasonal tightening of liquidity at the end of March, the Reserve Bank conducted four additional longer tenor (24-31 days) variable rate repo operations aggregating \u20b9 1 trillion, apart from the regular repo operations. In mid-March, additional liquidity of \u20b9 1 trillion got released into the system through redemption of Treasury Bills issued under the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) in April and May 2017. On the whole, the Reserve Bank injected \u20b9 60 billion and \u20b9 213 billion on a net daily average basis in February and March, respectively. The weighted average call rate (WACR) inched closer to the policy repo rate from 12 basis points below the policy rate in January to 7 bps in February, and 5 bps in March. 19. Merchandise export growth decelerated in January and February 2018, pulled down by a slowdown in exports of gems and jewellery, readymade garments and engineering goods. Import growth also moderated in February due to a decline in gold imports, lower growth in non- oil non-gold imports, and contraction in imports of transport equipment, vegetable oils and pulses. As import growth continued to exceed export growth in January-February, the trade deficit widened. The current account deficit increased in Q3:2017-18, primarily on account of the higher trade deficit. Net foreign direct investment moderated in April-January 2017-18 vis-\u00e0- vis the level a year ago. Foreign portfolio investors made net purchases in 2017-18, despite net sales in the wake of a global sell-off in February. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 424.4 billion on March 30, 2018. Outlook The 6th bi-monthly resolution of 2017-18 in February projected CPI inflation at 5.1 per 20. cent in Q4:2017-18; and in the range of 5.1-5.6 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.5-4.6 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact, with risks tilted to the upside. Actual inflation outcomes in January-February averaged 4.8 per cent, largely reflecting the sharp decline in vegetable prices and significant moderation in fuel group inflation. The available information suggests that vegetable prices continued to moderate in March as well. Accordingly, inflation in Q4:2017-18 is now projected at 4.5 per cent. 21. Several factors are likely to influence the inflation outlook. First, with the sharp moderation in food prices in February-March, the inflation trajectory in H1:2018-19 is expected to be lower than the projection in the February statement, despite a likely reversal in food prices in H1. Overall food inflation should remain under check on the assumption of a normal monsoon and effective supply management by the Government. Second, international crude oil prices have become volatile in the recent period, with a distinct hardening bias in the second half of March, even as the increase in shale production was more than expected. This has adversely impacted the outlook for crude oil prices. Third, on current assessment, Indian domestic demand is expected to strengthen during the course of the year. Fourth, the statistical impact of an increase in HRA for central government employees under the 7th CPC will continue till mid-2018, and gradually dissipate thereafter. 22. Taking these factors into consideration, projected CPI inflation for 2018-19 is revised to 4.7-5.1 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation is projected at 4.4-4.7 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2. 5 Turning to the growth outlook, several factors are expected to accelerate the pace of 23. economic activity in 2018-19. First, there are now clearer signs of revival in investment activity as reflected in the sustained expansion in capital goods production and still rising imports, albeit at a slower pace than in January. Second, global demand has been improving, which should encourage exports and boost fresh investment. On the whole, GDP growth is projected to strengthen from 6.6 per cent in 2017-18 to 7.4 per cent in 2018-19 \u2013 in the range of 7.3-7.4 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.6 per cent in H2 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).2 The MPC notes that there are several uncertainties surrounding the baseline inflation 24. path. First, the revised formula for MSP as announced in the Union Budget 2018-19 for kharif crops may have an impact on inflation, although the exact magnitude will be known only in the coming months. Second, the staggered impact of HRA revisions by various state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of the HRA revisions will be looked through, there is a need to watch out for any second round effects. Third, in case there is any further fiscal slippage from the Union Budget estimates for 2018-19 or the medium-term path, it could adversely impact the outlook on inflation. There are also risks to inflation from fiscal slippages at the level of states on account of higher committed revenue expenditure. Fourth, should the monsoon turn deficient temporally and/or spatially, it may have a significant bearing on food inflation. Fifth, firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey expect input and output prices to rise, going forward. Sixth, recent volatility in crude prices has imparted considerable uncertainty to the near-term outlook. 25. Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and continue with the neutral stance. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium- term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. 2 The implicit GDP growth projection in the 6th bi-monthly monetary policy statement was 7.4 per cent for 2018-19 \u2013 in the range of 7.4-7.5 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2. The MPC notes that growth has been recovering and the output gap is closing. This is 26. also reflected in a pick-up in credit offtake in recent months. The large mobilisation of resources from the primary capital market should support investment activity further. While the domestic cyclical recovery is underway, the long-term growth potential is also expected to be reinforced by various structural reforms introduced in the recent past. On the downside, the deterioration in public finances risks crowding out private financing and investment. Furthermore, even as global growth and trade have been strengthening, rising trade protectionism and financial market volatility could derail the ongoing global recovery. In this unsettling global environment, it is especially important that domestic macroeconomic fundamentals are strengthened, deleveraging of distressed corporates and rebuilding of bank balance sheets persisted with, and the risk- sharing markets deepened. 27. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra voted for an increase in the policy rate of 25 basis points. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by April 19, 2018. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on June 5 and 6, 2018. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.0 per cent Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Dr. Urjit R. Patel 29. My main concern in the last few reviews has been whether the ongoing cyclical recovery in growth will sustain, despite growing discomfort on the upside risks to the 4% inflation target in the medium-term. 30. The broad-based turnaround in growth continues to gather strength, although the turnaround is benefitting from a favourable base. Demand conditions improved in Q3 (2017- 2018). Capacity utilization, which tracks investment trends, has started to improve and is at the highest level now (at 74.3%) since Q2 2014-2015. Three-month average IIP growth (Nov 2017- Jan 2018) is 7.8% y-o-y; what is encouraging is that the high IIP growth is due to sequential gains and not base effects. Profitability in non-IT services has turned around. The sequential gains in the manufacturing sector are strong with the PMI-Manufacturing in expansion zone for the past 8 months. Credit growth continues to pick up, after lagging behind nominal GDP growth in the last two years. There is a risk that recent fraud in a public sector bank may make banks risk averse and slow lending. 7 31. closing. While consumption continues to be robust, investment is accelerating. Overall, growth signals are strong. Most indicators of the output gap suggest that it is 32. Food inflation continues to impart volatility to headline inflation and drive headline inflation momentum. Lower food inflation at 3.4% in February compared to 4.6% in January was the main driver of lower headline inflation (4.4%) in February. Inflation in vegetables is still elevated due to the adverse base in 2016-2017. Fuel inflation (at 6.8%) is much higher than all the other components. There was a marginal uptick in the 1-year ahead inflation expectations compared to the last round of the survey. Elevated and persistent inflation excluding food, fuel, and HRA adjustments is somewhat worrying. There is however a sustained moderation in cereals inflation, which is unusual. The total availability of pulses also appears to be well above demand estimates. 33. More than the cyclical drivers of food inflation, which for most items tends to be mean reverting, what worries me are the upside structural risks to inflation that impinge on the durability of the 4% inflation target in the medium term. In the past few reviews, I have flagged four such risks: (i) increases in minimum support prices (MSP), (ii) staggered implementation of the pay commission award by the States, (iii) slippages in the fiscal deficit in an election year, (iv) a sustaining of the price of oil at a high level. Of these, my main concern at the current juncture is the possible simultaneous occurrence 34. of adverse twin terms of trade shocks: internal (via a substantial upward revision of minimum support prices which would raise the relative prices of agricultural goods) and external (the price of oil sustains at a high level). Such twin terms of trade shocks would complicate inflation management and worsen the growth-inflation trade-off. 35. While details on what form the MSP policy will take are still awaited, my own research with co-authors shows that a one standard deviation net procurement shock not only increases inflation across all sectors, but after inflation rises for two quarters on impact, it remains positive for about six to seven quarters after that. As in an external terms of trade shock, which would push the Phillips curve of the economy upwards, compromising GDP growth and raising inflation in the medium term, an internal terms of trade shock via a rise in the MSP would do the same. The response to changes in the MSP would therefore need to be pursued in a systematic way to maintain durability of the medium-term 4% inflation target. I vote for a pause in the policy repo rate at today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy 37. Committee. 38. Headline inflation eased to 4.4% in February after rising to a 17-month high of 5.2% in December, 2017. This fall was largely due to a significant seasonal drop in vegetable prices, along with other components of food. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained unchanged in February, having stayed at 5.2% since December, partly due to housing inflation driven by the direct effects of house rent allowance for government employees under the 7th central pay commission. Despite the recent fall in headline inflation, several upside risks prevail. The proposed 39. link between the minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops with 1.5 times the cost of production may drive inflation up. Fiscal deficit slippage and the slower than expected fiscal consolidation, as well as the staggered impact of house rent allowance by state governments, may also exert pressure on inflation. The recent volatility in crude prices has also resulted in uncertainty regarding the inflation scenario. Further, the proposed increase in customs duty is likely to increase inflation. The outlook for inflation as per RBI\u2019s survey of households undertaken in March 2018 signals high inflation expectations for both three-month-ahead and one-year-ahead horizons. Further, the Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) of the RBI suggests hardening of input prices, which may be passed on to consumers and lead to higher CPI inflation. On the output front, the estimated GDP growth is 6.6% for 2017-18, lower than 7.1% for 40. 2016-17. Nevertheless, some positive signs of economic growth are visible, especially in revival of investment. Implementation of GST is stabilising and the recapitalization of public sector banks, as well as the steps towards NPA resolution under the insolvency and bankruptcy code, are expected to contribute to economic growth. On the other hand, banking sector risks can be an impediment to sustainable growth. Separately, the possibility of an escalating trade war is a growing risk factor. 41. Moreover, the Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by RBI in March 2018 presents a pessimistic outlook for General Economic Situation and Employment Scenario. This is supported by the languishing growth in the Economic Cycle Research Institute\u2019s (ECRI) Indian Leading Index, a harbinger of future economic activity, indicating dull prospects for economic growth. Further, growth in ECRI\u2019s 20-country composite Long Leading Index has eased, suggesting that global growth is likely to slow down. This has impacted growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Exports Index, a predictor of the direction of exports growth, which is subdued, indicating that Indian export growth outlook remains restrained. Dimming growth prospects at the global level are also indicated in the drop in the composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Indexes covering services and manufacturing for various economies, including the Euro area, the U.K., China and Japan, since the end of 2017, and more recently in the U.S. Thus, with upside risks to inflation and lacklustre growth prospects, a wait and watch 42. strategy with respect to evolving risks, along with status quo in interest rates, is currently recommended. 43. The headline inflation in January and February 2018 showed a sharper decline than what MPC had expected in its previous meeting. It is likely to show a lower print even during March 2018. From April 2018, however, it is expected to increase on account of unfavorable base effect for the next 3-4 months before it again starts declining to reach the level of around 4 per cent by March 2019. Thus, in the baseline scenario, we are likely to be at or around the target rate of headline inflation 12 months down. There are, however, several uncertainties and concerns surrounding this forecast. These are: (i) There is a revival of economic growth but not to the level expected by RBI. Although the capacity utilization has improved to around 74 per cent, I feel, it is still far below the threshold required to induce substantial fresh investment. There is hardly any evidence on employment growth picking up to a level that would put upward pressure on the wage growth. Thus, continued existence of a negative output gap has to be considered. (ii) Fears of a trade war among major global players are turning increasingly realistic with likely adverse impact on our exports and costs of production. It may severely affect our growth recovery over the coming year. (iii) Oil prices have been fluctuating and both their direction and magnitude are difficult to predict for any possible impact on the headline inflation during the coming year. (iv) Concerns about the adequacy of monsoon rains and implementation of the revision in minimum support prices of different crops add another dimension to the inflation uncertainties. (v) Implementation of the revisions in HRA for employees of different states and related organizations (like universities, research institutes, municipal bodies, etc.) in line with the 7th CPC could raise the headline inflation substantially over time. Although it has to be seen through because it would be only statistical, it does impact CPI as well as CPI excluding food and fuel significantly for about a year. And if the implementation is staggered among states, it would take even longer. In this context, it is argued that the second round effects of such an increase have to be considered. My research shows that inflation dynamics have changed during the current decade making the second round effects less relevant. (vi) Slippage by the Centre from the fiscal consolidation path and its likely adverse impact on the headline inflation and the cost of borrowing are often raised as a major concern. In this context, as I had pointed out in the last MPC minutes, it is the combined (Centre and all States together) fiscal deficit that matters for the headline inflation. By now, 26 states have presented their budgets and their combined budgeted fiscal deficit is estimated to be 2.6 per cent of GDP. Thus, to a large extent, the fiscal slippage of the Centre is compensated by the fiscal discipline shown by the States. The net impact on the headline inflation on this count, therefore, is likely to be very limited. Moreover, there are expectations about the tax revenues exceeding the revised estimates for the year 2017-18, reducing the estimate of the fiscal slippage by the Centre. If the same buoyancy continues, it can substantially reduce the magnitude of the fiscal slippage next year. On the other hand, the slippage can occur for various reasons including the forthcoming elections in States and the Centre. (vii) The Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) conducted by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) during February 2018 shows that the expected headline inflation (CPI) 12 months down by the businesses is 4.1 per cent but is increasing of late. Similarly, the RBI survey of household inflation expectations also shows increasing trend. 44. On account of all such uncertainties of impacts on headline inflation in both the directions, it is prudent to wait and watch the events play out before any decisive change in policy stance and/or rate can be considered. I, therefore, vote for maintaining a status quo on the policy rate and neutral stance. 45. I maintain my vote for a 25 basis points increase in the policy rate. Underlying macroeconomic developments impart some urgency to commencing the withdrawal of accommodation. 46. The ebbing of inflation in January and February will likely extend into the reading for March, given the continuing decline in prices of vegetables. Does it present a persuasive case for an easier/neutral monetary policy stance? In my view, that will be time-inconsistent and will push the achievement of the inflation target farther out in time, given the current assessment that the target is not likely to be achieved during the full course of 2018-19, absent policy action. It is important to recognise that volatility in the prices of vegetables is obscuring a clearer 47. evaluation of underlying inflation pressures. An unseasonal spike in November has given way to a delayed seasonal easing in February and March, which should reverse by April-May. Accordingly, this transient supply shock, however favourable it might be, has to be looked through while setting monetary policy so that the focus is on the real risks to food inflation looming over the horizon from (a) increases in minimum support prices announced in the union budget; and (b) the shortfall in wheat output and the implications for prices of cereals. The main risks to the achievement of the target are festering in the category of CPI 48. excluding food and fuel in which inflation has stubbornly risen above 5 per cent over the past three months. Over the course of 2018-19, inflation in this category is expected to peak close to 6 per cent in June and moderate in the rest of the year to settle at a little above 5 per cent. It is necessary, however, to adjust for the statistical impact of the HRA in assessing this trajectory. After the adjustment, the baseline path of inflation excluding food and fuel is one of monotonical hardening till the end of the year without the June peak. Meanwhile, upside risks in the form of international crude prices, rising raw material and other input prices, the slow return of pricing power among corporates, the spectre of trade wars and embedded tariff increases - which could turn out to be both inflationary and growth retarding \u2013 and bouts of global spillovers as markets re-price the normalization of monetary policy by systemic central banks have increased. Should the food situation turn adverse or overwhelm food management strategies, we will have to deal with inflation testing the upper tolerance limit of the inflation band. Households are reflecting these fears in their inflation expectations, and both bond and credit markets have been tightening interest rates well ahead of the MPC. 49. Impulses of growth are strengthening. The turnaround in the pace of investment is the defining feature of 2017-18 in contrast to the consumption-led growth in preceding years. Foodgrains and horticulture production are set to scale new records. Manufacturing is on an accelerating mode and the recovery is broadening and encompassing an increasing number of constituent industries in its ambit. It is supported by rising sales growth, an uptick in seasonally adjusted capacity utilization, drawdown of finished goods inventories and upbeat business confidence even as the regaining of pricing power is helping to shore up profit margins. There are also indications of the capex cycle gradually starting up. It is important that these drivers be nurtured to full strength and traction, and not be frittered away by allowing inflation to get out of hand in an environment of fiscal slippages at the central and state levels, a current account deficit that is modest but on the rise, and balance sheets of banks and corporates still fragile. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 50. In my minutes of the February 2018 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, I had flagged two reasons that had induced me to pause from voting to begin the process of \u201cwithdrawal of accommodation\u201d: first, the possibility of US shale gas response softening the oil price outlook, and two, growth recovery in the economy still being nascent. Uncertainty on these fronts has now receded. In spite of the US shale gas response to rising oil prices being robust, inventories have 51. continued to dwindle. The combination of OPEC supply cuts and strengthening global demand appear to be keeping international oil prices at a relatively high level, and the volatility of prices around the high level has been relatively low in the past three to six months. The dwindling stock of inventories implies that a supply side disruption to any one critical source, for instance, due to geopolitical risk, could have a sharp upward impact on prices. On the domestic front, the lack of fiscal space to go easy on fuel cesses implies that prices at the pump will likely mirror movements in international prices. Since global commodity prices as a group are refusing to budge, the overall outlook is not comforting from the standpoint of domestic inflation. 52. On the growth front, while we have not seen another print from the CSO since last policy, most real economic activity indicators, including the Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index (PMI) data released during the week of MPC meeting, point to growing traction in the drivers underlying growth. In fact, RBI\u2019s estimates suggest that output gap is closing; the finance-adjusted measure, which I personally prefer, shows near complete closure of the output gap due to the resilient credit growth over the past two quarters. This is further confirmed by high frequency data on rural and urban consumption, investment activity revival, and improvement in capacity utilisation. In my view, these healthy developments on the economic activity front are likely to remain durable due to steady progress in the time-bound resolution of twin balance-sheet problem affecting our banks and corporates. 53. In view of the above referred developments since the last MPC meeting, I have moved substantially closer to switching from the neutral stance to beginning the process of withdrawal of accommodation. This is in spite of the softening of inflation in recent prints. Let me explain in some detail. An inflation targeting central bank needs to separate \u201csignal\u201d from \u201cnoise\u201d in the data: Recent prints have softened due primarily to easing of vegetable prices (contributing to over 90 per cent of softening of food inflation in February). Digging into specifics does not suggest that this is due to durable supply management in vegetables. Instead, reasonable conclusion is that vegetable prices continue to show seasonality over years, albeit with some variation in months in which the seasonality kicks in. This volatility is largely \u201cnoise\u201d from an interest-rate setting perspective; this volatility is also not something amenable to monetary policy actions, and certainly not at short horizon of a few months at which it is likely to, and typically does, revert. What concerns me is that the more persistent component of headline inflation, which is ex food and fuel, and which one can consider as the \u201csignal\u201d given its persistence, has strengthened steadily from a trough of 3.8 per cent last June to 4.4 per cent in February (excluding the estimated impact of Centre\u2019s House Rent Allowance increase, i.e., ex HRA). This rise has been broad-based, consistent with the durability of a growth pick-up over this period, and also confirmed by input price pressures and selling price increases reported by firms in the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey. The inflation trajectory over the entire twelve-month period is projected, despite the soft print in February, to remain above the MPC target rate of 4 per cent, on a quarter by quarter basis. Note that this is the case even after excluding the HRA impact. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank also expect the inflation to stay over 4 per cent for much of 2018-19. While there is inevitable uncertainty around these inflation projections, I view the risks as tilted significantly to the upside given the continuing rise in the ex-food-and-fuel inflation. Besides oil prices, my another primary concern is the risk of fiscal slippages, at both the Centre and State levels, especially in the form of: o A shift away from capital expenditures towards revenue expenditures, as is already being seen in state expenditure to accommodate farm loan waivers; and, o Food price-support measures, on which further clarity is needed, but which clearly induce an upside bias to potential inflation risks (estimates vary widely from 10 basis points to close to 100 basis points depending on what measures are adopted). Finally, as the Indian economy is economically as well as financially integrated with the global economy, a faster normalisation of interest rates by systemic central banks can also pose a major challenge to the external sector. 55. I feel it is important to let some more hard data come in, especially on growth, and allow some more time to let the early skirmishes on the global trade front play out. I am, however, likely to shift decisively to vote for a beginning of \u201cwithdrawal of accommodation\u201d in the next MPC meeting in June. Reinforcement of inflation-targeting credibility that such a shift would signal is crucial in my view for prudent macroeconomic management, on both the domestic and external sector fronts. CPI inflation moderated in January-February, led largely by a sharp decline in vegetable 56. prices and continuing deflation in pulses. Fuel group inflation also moderated mainly on the back of a decline in liquefied petroleum gas inflation, reflecting softening in international prices. These developments, combined with the continued softening in vegetable prices in March, are expected to pull down the headline CPI inflation in Q4:2017-18 below the projection made in February. However, it is noteworthy that over the last three months (December-February), the monthly CPI headline inflation (year-on-year) adjusted for house rent allowance (HRA) revision has averaged 4.6 percent. 57. Going forward, the combined effects of the observed moderation in food inflation in January-February and the expected further softening in March are likely to result in lower headline inflation trajectory in the first half of 2018-19 vis-\u00e0-vis the February statement. This will be despite the likely seasonal reversal of food prices in the first half. Inflation expectations have firmed up, both for three-month and one-year ahead horizons. Input cost pressures are rising and the corporates are gradually regaining some pricing power. The outlook of inflation 13 also faces several uncertainties emanating from: (i) the increase in minimum support prices for kharif crops; (ii) elevated and volatile crude oil prices, in part due to geo-political factors; (iii) the staggered impact of revision in HRA by various State Governments \u2013 the direct impact on inflation will be statistical in nature, which will be looked through; (iv) fiscal slippages by the Centre and the States; and (v) the performance of the monsoon. 58. Economic activity has been recovering, with the GDP growth in 2018-19 projected to be higher at 7.4 per cent (with balanced risks) as compared with 6.6 per cent in the previous year. There are clearer signs of revival of investment activity. The manufacturing sector is strengthening, which is also reflected in higher capacity utilisation. Improving global demand and trade should boost manufacturing and investment activity, going forward. Leading indicators also point to the strengthening of the services sector; purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for services moved into the expansion zone again in March. Credit offtake from the banking sector has continued to improve and it is becoming gradually more broad-based. The flow of funds from non-bank sources to the corporate sector has also been rising. 59. Even as inflation has moderated in recent months, several upside risks to inflation persist. Hence, I would like to wait for more data and watch how various risks to inflation evolve, going forward. I, therefore, vote for holding the policy repo rate at the current level and maintaining the stance as neutral. ", "file10": "The eleventh meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from June 4 to 6, 2018 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely:\u2013 (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit confidence, households\u2019 conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the last meeting of the MPC in April, global economic activity has continued to expand, though there has been some easing of momentum. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy began the year on a weak note on soft private spending and reduced residential investment; however, there seems to be a rebound in Q2:2018 with strong retail sales and improved employment data. The Euro Area growth decelerated in Q1; recent industrial production data as well as weak consumer and business sentiment suggest a loss of pace. The Japanese economy contracted in Q1, though it is expected to turn around in Q2 as indicated by recent data prints on exports and the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). 7. Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) remained largely resilient. The Chinese economy maintained a strong momentum in Q1; more recent data on industrial production and PMI suggest that growth is likely to hold steady in Q2. The Russian economy appears to have picked up in recent months after a soft end to 2017; both manufacturing and services PMI rose in April. In South Africa, growth prospects have improved with the return of political stability as reflected in consumer confidence, manufacturing PMI and retail sales. In contrast, a stream of poor data from Brazil on high unemployment and soft industrial production show that the effects of recession linger. 8. Global trade growth has continued to strengthen, though geo-political tensions have contributed recently to declining export orders and air freight. Crude oil prices rose sharply till May 24 on heightened geo-political tensions, but moderated thereafter on expectations of easing of supplies by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. Base metal prices, especially aluminium, have risen on account of US sanctions on Russia. Gold has witnessed selling pressure on a stronger dollar, but the metal gained last week on political uncertainty in the Euro Area. Inflation pressures have emerged in some key advanced and emerging economies, driven in part by rising commodity prices. Financial markets have been driven mainly by monetary policy expectations and geo- 9. political developments. Equity market performance has varied across regions with modest gains in the AEs on strong Q1 earnings and abating of trade tensions, while stocks in major EMEs have faced sell offs on a rising dollar and expectations of further rate hikes by the Fed. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US crossed 3 per cent in mid-May on strong economic data as well as expectations of tighter monetary policy and fiscal expansion, but softened subsequently on safe haven demand; yields softened in other key AEs as well. In most EMEs, however, bond yields have risen on reduced foreign appetite for their debt due to growing dollar shortage in the global market and on prospects of higher interest rates in AEs. In currency markets, the US dollar touched its highest level in May since December 2017. The euro depreciated significantly against the dollar reflecting a combination of factors, including soft growth data for the Euro Area, which suggested that monetary policy normalisation by the European Central Bank could be delayed, and political uncertainty in its southern periphery. EME currencies have, by and large, depreciated against the US dollar. On the domestic front, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released on May 31 the 10. quarterly estimates of national income accounts for Q4:2017-18 and provisional estimates for 2017-18. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2017-18 has been estimated at 6.7 per cent, up by 0.1 percentage point from the second advance estimates released on February 28. This increase in growth has been underpinned by a significant upward revision in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) due especially to improved rural demand on the back of a bumper harvest and the government\u2019s thrust on rural housing and infrastructure. Quarterly data suggest that the economy grew at 7.7 per cent in Q4:2017-18 \u2013 the fastest pace in the last seven quarters. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth accelerated for three consecutive quarters up to Q4. On the supply side, estimates of agriculture and allied activities have been revised 11. upwards, supported by an all-time high production of foodgrains and horticulture during the year. On a quarterly basis, agriculture growth increased sharply in Q4:2017-18. On April 16, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast a normal south-west monsoon rainfall, which was reaffirmed on May 30. This augurs well for the agricultural sector. 12. robust performance of manufacturing, which accelerated for three consecutive quarters in Q4. Capacity utilisation by manufacturing firms increased significantly in Q4:2017-18 as revealed in the latest round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS). The output of eight core industries accelerated in April on account of a sharp expansion in coal production, which reached a 42-month peak. Cement output also posted double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive month in April. However, electricity generation slowed down. As per the early results of the Reserve Bank\u2019s April-June round of the industrial outlook survey (IOS), activity is expected to expand at a lower rate in Q1:2018-19 due to a significant rise in input prices and perceptions of softening domestic and external demand conditions. However, the manufacturing PMI remained in an expansionary mode for the tenth consecutive month in May on the back of new domestic orders and exports. Although services sector growth was revised downwards on account of lower growth 13. in some constituents such as trade, hotels, transport & communication, and financial services, it remained robust. Construction activity recorded the highest growth in Q4 in the new series (base 2011-12). Various high frequency indicators also suggest resilient performance of the services sector. Improving sales of tractors and two-wheelers suggest strengthening of rural demand. Commercial vehicle sales also accelerated in April. Revenue-earning freight traffic of railways picked up, driven by improved movement in coal, fertilisers, and cement. Growth in passenger vehicle sales accelerated but port traffic decelerated for the third successive month in April. Domestic air passenger traffic rose significantly in April. Two key indicators of construction activity showed improvement \u2013 cement production growth accelerated and steel consumption turned around. Services PMI moved slightly into contraction in May, reflecting decline in business activity and stagnation in new orders. Industrial growth also strengthened, reflecting 14. Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, rose sharply to 4.6 per cent in April, driven mainly by a significant increase in inflation excluding food and fuel. Excluding the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowances (HRAs) for central government employees, headline inflation was at 4.2 per cent in April, up from 3.9 per cent in March. Food inflation moderated for the fourth successive month, pulled down by vegetables due to lower than the usual seasonal increase in their prices, and pulses and sugar which continued to experience deflation. However, within the food group, inflation increased in respect of cereals, fruits, prepared meals, meat and fish. 15. Fuel group inflation declined for the fifth month in a row in April mainly on account of a fall in the inflation of liquefied petroleum gas in line with international prices, and electricity. However, inflation in other major items of fuel such as firewood and chips, dung cake, kerosene and coal inched up. Inflation in the transport and communication sub-group accelerated due to the firming up of international crude oil prices, even though the domestic pass-through to petrol and diesel was incomplete. Inflation also picked up in clothing, household goods and services, health, recreation, education, and personal care and effects. 16. The May 2018 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of households reported a significant rise in households\u2019 inflation expectations of 90 basis points (bps) and 130 bps, respectively, for three-month and one-year ahead horizons. Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s IOS reported input price pressures and an increase in selling prices in Q1:2018-19. Firms polled for the manufacturing PMI in May also showed a sharp increase in input and output prices. Farm inputs and industrial raw material costs have risen sequentially. Wage pressures in the rural sector moderated; however, those in the organised sectors remained firm. 17. Liquidity in the system remained generally in surplus during April-May 2018. During April, the Reserve Bank absorbed surplus liquidity of \u20b9496 billion on a daily net average basis due to increased government spending, especially in the second half of the month. Reflecting easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (WACR) softened to 5.89 per cent in April (from 5.96 per cent in March). However, surplus liquidity in the system moderated considerably in the first half of May and the system moved into deficit in the third week of May mainly due to inflows on account of the goods and services tax (GST). The Reserve Bank conducted an open market operation purchase auction on May 17, 2018 to inject liquidity of \u20b9100 billion into the system. The system again turned into surplus in the last week of May reflecting mainly the payment of food subsidies. Surplus liquidity absorbed under the LAF on a daily net average basis declined to \u20b9142 billion in May. The WACR in May at 5.88 per cent remained broadly at the April 2018 level. 18. India\u2019s exports grew in April 2018 after a marginal dip in the preceding month, supported mainly by non-oil exports, particularly engineering goods and chemicals. Import growth decelerated sequentially in April 2018; a significant decline in imports of gold as well as pearl and precious stones more than offset the impact of rising crude oil prices. Nevertheless, the trade deficit expanded in March and April from its level a year ago. External financing remained comfortable in 2017-18. While net foreign direct investment in 2017-18 was broadly comparable with the previous year, net foreign portfolio flows were stronger due to a sharp turnaround in debt inflows. However, foreign portfolio investors withdrew US$ 6.7 billion on a net basis from the domestic capital market in 2018-19 (up to June 4) reflecting volatility in global financial markets. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 412 billion on June 1, 2018. Outlook 19. The first bi-monthly resolution of 2018-19 in April projected CPI inflation in the range of 4.7-5.1 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees with risks tilted to the upside. Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation was projected at 4.4-4.7 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2. Actual inflation outcomes since the April policy have evolved broadly on the lines of the projected trajectory. However, there has been an important compositional shift. While the summer momentum in vegetable prices was weaker than the usual pattern, there was an abrupt acceleration in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. 20. The headline inflation outlook is driven primarily by two countervailing effects. On the one hand, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose sharply in April over March by 80 basis points to reach an ex-HRA level of 5.3 per cent, suggesting a hardening of underlying inflationary pressures. Furthermore, since the MPC\u2019s meeting in early April, the price of Indian basket of crude surged from US$ 66 a barrel to US$ 74. This, along with an increase in other global commodity prices and recent global financial market developments, has resulted in a firming up of input cost pressures, as also confirmed in the Reserve Bank\u2019s IOS for manufacturing firms in Q2:2018-19. The resulting pick-up in the momentum of inflation excluding food, fuel and HRA has imparted persistence into higher CPI projections for 2018- 19. On the other hand, food inflation has remained muted over the past few months and the usual seasonal pickup delayed, softening the projections in the short run. Taking these effects into account, projected CPI inflation for 2018-19 is revised to 4.8-4.9 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation is projected at 4.6 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2. 21. Turning to the growth outlook, the CSO\u2019s provisional estimates have placed GDP growth for Q4:2017-18 at 7.7 per cent \u2013 70 basis points higher than that in Q3 \u2013 given the sharp acceleration in investment and construction activity. With improving capacity utilisation and credit offtake, investment activity is expected to remain robust even as there has been some tightening of financing conditions in recent months. Global demand has also been buoyant, which should encourage exports and provide a further thrust to investment. The sharp rise in petroleum product prices, however, is likely to impact disposable incomes. Consumption, both rural and urban, remains healthy and is expected to strengthen further. According to the early results of the Reserve Bank\u2019s IOS, activity in the manufacturing sector is expected to moderate marginally in Q2:2018-19 on account of deterioration in the overall business situation and order book. On the basis of an overall assessment, GDP growth for 2018-19 is retained at 7.4 per cent as in the April policy. GDP growth is projected in the range of 7.5-7.6 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). 22. A major upside risk to the baseline inflation path in the April resolution has materialised, viz., 12 per cent increase in the price of Indian crude basket, which was sharper, earlier than expected and seems to be durable. Crude oil prices have been volatile recently and this imparts considerable uncertainty to the inflation outlook \u2013 both on the upside and the downside. Several other risks remain. First, global financial market developments have emerged as another important source of uncertainty. Second, the significant rise in households\u2019 inflation expectations as gathered in the May 2018 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey could feed into wages and input costs in the coming months. However, the pass- through to output prices remains muted presently. Third, the staggered impact of HRA revisions by various state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through, there is a need to watch out for any second round impact on inflation. Fourth, the impact of the revision in the MSP formula for kharif crops is not possible to assess at this stage in the absence of adequate details. Fifth, as forecast by the IMD, if the monsoon is normal and well-distributed temporally and spatially, it may help keep food inflation benign. 23. Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and keep the stance neutral. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. 24. The MPC notes that domestic economic activity has exhibited sustained revival in recent quarters and the output gap has almost closed. Investment activity, in particular, is recovering well and could receive a further boost from swift resolution of distressed sectors of the economy under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Geo-political risks, global financial market volatility and the threat of trade protectionism pose headwinds to the domestic recovery. It is important that public finances do not crowd out private sector investment activity at this crucial juncture. Adherence to budgetary targets by the Centre and the States \u2013 which appears to be the case thus far \u2013 will also ease upside risks to the inflation outlook considerably. 25. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of the decision. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by June 20, 2018. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on July 31 and August 1, 2018. Voting on the Resolution to increase the policy repo rate by 25 bps to 6.25 per cent Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Dr. Urjit R. Patel 27. Since the adoption of flexible inflation targeting in India (de facto in 2014 and de jure in 2016), the \u201cgreat-disinflation\u201d experienced by the Indian economy is a major accomplishment. After several years of high inflation in the run-up to 2014, the March 2018 CPI headline inflation (ex-HRA) rate of 3.9% is a testimony to the successful conduct of monetary policy given its consistency with the 4 +/- 2 percent target recommended by the Urjit Patel Committee report in 2014 and enshrined in the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 in 2016. Both the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of India should be congratulated in calibrating a monetary-fiscal mix that has helped engender this disinflation. Good luck helped with this outcome but so did good policy. Inflation targeting however can truly become successful if the inflation target and the 28. inflation forecast become identical on a durable basis. Locking in the 4 percent medium target therefore requires continual vigilance. Since the last review, demand conditions have continued to remain robust. Q4: 2017- 29. 2018 headline growth of 7.7% was the highest in 7 quarters. While capacity utilization increased throughout 2017-18, the pick-up since Q3 (74.1%) appears to be decisive. The successful resolution of cases under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code will further assist capacity utilization without requiring new investment. 30. Despite the PMIs for services being somewhat fragile, overall corporate profits remain strong. While consumption (PFCE) growth remains tepid (the Q4 growth print was close to the average of the last 7 quarters), the strong revival of investment demand, manufacturing, and construction gives me more confidence about the durability of the growth recovery. Even though the high growth print of Q4:2017-2018 is pushed up by a base effect, I am more certain that the ongoing cyclical recovery in growth will sustain and this will lead to a faster closing of the output gap. 31. The revival of growth brings new inflationary risks that need to be carefully watched. The RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys suggest that upward pressures in input and staff costs are being marked by an increase in selling prices. Staff costs in services increased by 6.6%, and 11.6% in manufacturing compared to the last round of the survey. Food inflation continues to be maverick with a 4th consecutive month decline: the usual seasonal uptick in April uncharacteristically surprised on the downside. CPI inflation ex food and fuel, which in April, sustained close to 6%, with strong momentum effects is worryingly becoming the main driver of inflation. Almost all components of CPI ex food fuel registered upticks suggesting that demand-pull forces are creeping into CPI headline inflation. 32. A major upside risk to the one-year ahead CPI projections has been the price of oil. This has been on a durable rise over the past six months, reflecting stronger global growth and the increasing costs of creating capacity in substitutes. While a strong dollar and the price of oil usually follows an inverse relationship, the usual \u201ccoupling\u201d has been confounded by geo- political events in recent months. The volatility in the price of oil needs to be carefully watched, especially because higher fuel prices have helped harden inflationary expectations (both the 3- month ahead and 1-year ahead) to their highest level since September 2016. 33. The combination of cost-push and demand-pull factors at the current juncture has put one-year ahead inflation projections significantly above 4%. This warrants a monetary policy response. However, because of uncertainty surrounding the price of oil, and the nascent recovery of the economy, it would be opportune to take small steps. 34. I await details on the MSP policy. The outcome of a simultaneous twin terms of trade shock to the Indian economy as explained in my minutes of the April MPC meeting needs to be carefully watched. I vote for an increase in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points at today\u2019s meeting of 35. the Monetary Policy Committee. 36. Headline inflation rose to 4.6% in April from 4.3% in March and 4.4% in February, despite subdued food inflation. This was primarily due to a broad-based hardening of inflation excluding food and fuel with inflation rising in transport and communication, housing, health, recreation, education and personal care and effects. Even after excluding the estimated impact of the HRA adjustment for central government employees, inflation showed an uptick between March and April. 37. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative responses from the May round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of Households reflect a hardening of inflation expectations. In particular, the survey reports a rise in households\u2019 inflation expectations for three-month and one-year horizons. The May round of the Consumer Confidence Survey also shows a deteriorating outlook with respect to the price situation. The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) reports pressures in input costs and selling prices. Firms surveyed for the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index also indicate an increase in input and output prices. 38. The upside risks to inflation include geopolitical risks associated with crude oil prices, increase in other global commodity prices, implementation of HRA revisions (state governments), increase in kharif minimum support prices, fiscal slippage and a weaker Indian rupee. The downside risks include forecast of a normal monsoon, and moderation in global commodity prices due to slowdown in global growth. 39. On the output side, the provisional estimates of GDP released recently show that the Indian economy grew at 6.7% in 2017-18 and the performance of the economy in Q4, 2017- 18 was strong with GDP growth at 7.7%, although this partly reflects a favourable base effect. Improving growth in the economy is also reflected in the rising capacity utilization of manufacturing firms as per the RBI\u2019s Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilization Survey (OBICUS) as well as acceleration of growth in cement and steel production, upward revision of agricultural growth and resilience of the services sector. Industrial growth has also been robust, as is reflected in the strong performance in manufacturing for the past three consecutive quarters. 40. However, global growth is losing steam, as anticipated earlier by the long leading indexes of international growth maintained by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York. In particular, quarter-over-quarter GDP growth turned negative in Japan, and declined in the Eurozone, the U.K. and the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018. While U.S. GDP growth is expected to improve in the current quarter, ECRI\u2019s forward-looking indexes still point to fading global growth prospects. Also, the global manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index fell to a nine-month low in May, underscoring a moderating global industrial growth outlook. Furthermore, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Exports Index is in a deepening cyclical downswing, suggesting that Indian export growth will remain in a cyclical downtrend at least for the next couple of quarters. Moreover, India\u2019s domestic growth outlook is lacklustre, at best, according to ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Index. 41. In the meantime, with underlying inflation pressures in a cyclical upswing, according to ECRI\u2019s U.S. Future Inflation Gauge, U.S. inflation has also been on the rise, and is now at the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% inflation target. At the same time, the unemployment rate has dropped to an 18-year low, spurring the Fed to keep tightening monetary policy. 42. In India, with hardening of actual inflation, rising inflation expectations along with prevailing upside risks to inflation, I vote for an increase in the repo rate by 25 basis points while retaining the neutral stance. Statement by Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia After the last MPC meeting (5th April, 2018), several macroeconomic uncertainties 43. have reduced and a clearer picture is emerging. However, some basic uncertainties still remain on geo-politics, international trade policies and ability of some advanced economies to pursue interest rate hikes. More specifically, I consider the following factors for the repo rate decision in the present policy: (i) Oil prices have further firmed up and geo-political developments indicate no respite likely on that count soon. For the next 12-18 months, the oil prices are likely to stay at higher level adding to the twin deficits (fiscal and current account) and inflationary pressures. (ii) RBI survey of households for inflationary expectations in the May 2018 round shows a significant increase of about 90 bps and 130 bps respectively for 3 months and 12 months ahead compared to the March 2018 round. We may note that the impact on consumers\u2019 inflationary expectations of an oil price increase is almost 4 to 5 times higher than the similar increase in food prices and, therefore, we have to consider these numbers cautiously. (iii) RBI consumer confidence survey in April-May 2018 shows improvement in employment and household income outlook during the coming year. This indicates building up of demand pressures. (iv) IIM Ahmedabad survey of businesses in April 2018 also shows a substantial increase of about 60 bps in their expectation of headline CPI inflation 12 months ahead compared to February 2018 and is around 4.7 per cent. (v) Capacity utilization has increased substantially as revealed by different surveys. Growth in capital formation has also picked up. GDP growth at 7.7 per cent for 2017-18 Q4 assures that the Indian economy is firmly on the recovery path. All this indicates that the output gap has started closing. However, it has still not started exercising any pressure on unemployment and wage scenario and thereby on inflation. In this context, it is important to recognize that while the average growth during 2018-19 is likely to be around 7.4 per cent, in none of the quarters it is projected to exceed the 7.7 per cent mark observed in 2017-18 Q4. Growing protectionism around the globe and oil prices staying high can pose genuine downside risk to our growth. (vi) RBI\u2019s latest inflation forecast considering the CPI prints up to April 2018 for 2018-19Q4 stands 30 bps higher than its last forecast based on CPI data up to February 2018. It is forcasted at 4.7 per cent for 2018-19Q4, which is the same as expected by the businesses and is, therefore, more credible. Inflation rate likely to stay consistently above 4 \u2013 4.5 per cent is a cause of concern, particularly when there are some upside risks. It brings down the expected real policy rate in India that is substantially less than our comparator countries like Brazil, Mexico, China and South Africa though it is negative for most other G20 countries. Most of the advanced G20 countries where the real policy rates are negative are committed to rate hikes over the coming year. Now when the economic growth is firmly on the path of strong recovery in India, growing inflation concerns need to be addressed. 44. The upside risks to inflation such as MSP revision and HRA revision implementation by states are likely to be countered by reconfirmed normal monsoon forecasts and the lack of fiscal space in several states. Oil prices could turn on either side and hence present a genuine risk. There are chances that headline CPI prints in the coming months (H1) may turn out to be lower than expected by RBI (i.e. 4.8-4.9 per cent inflation) and in such a case, the inflation forecast 12 months ahead may come down. Although such possibilities are not ruled out, their chances are less. Under such circumstances, I believe that prudence lies in retaining the neutral policy stance, but increase the policy rate by 25 bps for now. Future course of action should depend on how the scenario on growth and inflation develops. This time, I would imbue urgency into my vote to raise the policy rate by 25 basis 45. points and align the operating target. 46. In my view, the prolonged period of staying on hold is denting the credibility of the MPC's commitment to maintaining inflation at the centre of the target band. There is a rising risk that the public may start discounting this commitment: if it begins to believe that the MPC is willing to tolerate inflation in higher reaches, inflation expectations can be set adrift. The status quo is also dissipating the hard earned reputational bonus that accrued to the RBI for breaking the back of the high inflation episode of 2009-13. There was a lot of good luck then as international commodity prices collapsed, but good policy too as we set out a glide path of disinflation that took India out of the fragile five. 47. The major upside risks to inflation that the MPC has worried about in past resolutions are crystallising on an ongoing basis. Moreover, the early warning indicators \u2013 households' inflation expectations; professional forecasters' projections; input and selling prices captured in the RBI\u2019s surveys and polled by purchasing managers; various input costs, farm and non- farm, including corporate staff costs; erosion in consumer confidence on the price situation \u2013 are all flashing amber or red. Markets and financial institutions are already getting ahead of the curve. Continuing policy inaction is running the danger of allowing inflation outcomes to slip away from the centre of the target band. The gains of macroeconomic stability that have defined the recent period as its greatest achievement could get frittered away. 48. Turning to growth, the economy is gathering speed. Buoyant sales growth, depleting inventories, rising capacity utilization and rising consumer optimism on spending, especially on discretionary items, all suggest that slack in the economy is being pulled in and the output gap is set to close. Consequently, demand-pull components are showing up in recent inflation readings. In this finely poised situation, inflation volatility can hamstring the new impulses of investment growth that have sprung up in recent quarters. 49. In my view, the time has come for the MPC to act unanimously to raise the policy rate by 25 basis points in a closing sliver of opportunity. This will demonstrate our resolve to return inflation to the centre of the target band. Monetary policy has to step in before it is too late and guide the economy along a non-accelerating inflation growth path. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 50. In the Minutes of the April 2018 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, I had indicated my growing concern around underlying inflationary pressures. These pressures have been manifesting as a strengthening of Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation excluding food and fuel even after adjusting for the impact of Centre\u2019s House Rent Allowances (HRA). There has been a rise in input costs due to supply shocks such as the sharp oil price surge witnessed over the past nine months. The strengthening of inflation also reflects aggregate demand pressures, which are confirmed in the now almost-closed output gap, improved capacity utilization figures, and a significant pick up in credit growth. As a result, the projection for medium-term headline CPI inflation has become firmer on the upside; it has moved closer to 5% and away from 4%, the latter being the mandated target of the MPC. 51. The inflationary pressure also seems to be experienced by the common man. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey (IES) of households reveals a uniform picture of hardening of inflation expectations whichever way one looks at the data. Most notably, the 3-month ahead and 12-month ahead inflation expectations have increased sharply by 90 basis points (bps) and 130 bps, respectively, since the last survey. They are likely explained by the fact that petrol and diesel prices carry salience: fuel prices are in the face and generalise rapidly through transportation costs into prices of general goods and services. A key uncertainty at present relates to the oil price development over medium-term 52. horizon that monetary policy operates at. Robust global growth, OPEC and Russian supply cuts, supply shock in Venezuela, and geo-political uncertainty around the Iranian supply have all pushed international crude prices uncomfortably high in a short span of time. The shape of Brent futures curve (now in \u201cbackwardation\u201d, i.e., buying oil forward is cheaper than buying it in spot) suggests the markets are pricing in the risk of a \u201cstock out\u201d \u2013 not having access to supply when it is needed. The US shale gas response appears to not have been enough as of yet to dampen this stock-out risk since some of the supply faces pipeline-infrastructure headwinds in reaching the markets. 53. The one respite for headline inflation prints has been the continuing benign food inflation where seasonal pickup has remained muted due to a collapse in the prices of onions and tomatoes. This has imparted a short-run softening to inflation projections keeping them contained in the first half of 2018-19 in spite of the rising momentum in CPI ex-food, fuel and HRA. However, if the seasonal pick-up does manifest in the first half at some point, then the headline prints will have little abatement from any of its constituents. Under such a scenario, any upward pressure on food prices such as through generous minimum support prices (MSPs) would exacerbate headline inflation pressures. Factoring in these considerations, there is no alternative to raising the policy rate by 25 54. bps so as to signal concern about underlying inflation, manage inflation expectations, and guard proactively against a further increase in inflation. However, considerable uncertainties around oil and food prices as well as the playing out of trade wars and global financial market outcomes led me to keep the stance neutral. It will allow the MPC to determine in a flexible manner what further monetary policy response is warranted based on an ongoing assessment of the inflation situation, inflation expectations and growth prints in the coming months. 55. A key risk to inflation cited in the MPC\u2019s April 2018 resolution has since materialised; crude oil prices have risen sharply by over 12 per cent even as there was some moderation in recent days. On the positive side, food inflation has continued to be benign. On the whole, inflation in March and April has behaved more or less on the lines of the path projected in the April resolution. Two developments are noteworthy from the standpoint of price stability. First, inflation (CPI ex-HRA) has averaged 4.4 per cent since November 2017. Second, inflation expectations of households have risen significantly as reflected in the May 2018 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey. 56. Looking ahead, projected inflation for Q4:2018-19 (at 4.7 percent) is 30 bps higher than that in the April resolution. The baseline inflation path faces several uncertainties, viz., (i) the outlook for oil prices; (ii) continuing volatility in global financial markets; (iii) the risk of the significant rise in households\u2019 inflation expectations feeding into wages and input costs, even as the pass-through to output prices has remained muted so far; (iv) the impact of the likely revision in the MSP formula; and (v) second round impact on inflation on account of the staggered impact of HRA revisions by various state governments, though the direct statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through. However, a normal monsoon, by keeping food inflation benign, could act as a mitigating factor. 57. Domestic growth has strengthened with the Q4:2017-18 print at a seven-quarter high and now appears to be on a sustainable path. Investment activity, in particular, has accelerated. There has also been a pick-up in manufacturing and this is manifested in an increase in capacity utilisation. The services sector has been resilient with several high frequency indicators continuing to show robust growth in recent months even as PMI services moved slightly into contraction in May. Bank credit growth has continued to improve. The recent increase in oil prices, by impacting disposable incomes, may have some adverse impact on private consumption. On the whole, however, economic activity continues to be resilient with GDP growth for 2018-19 projected at 7.4 per cent, same as in the April policy. Inflation risks have increased since the April policy. I, therefore, vote for an increase in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. In view of prevailing uncertainties, it is apposite to maintain the neutral stance so as to respond to the evolving situation in a flexible manner. ", "file11": "The twelfth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from July 30 to August 1, 2018 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the amended Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.5 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.25 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.75 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the last meeting of the MPC in June 2018, global economic activity has continued to maintain steam; however, global growth has become uneven and risks to the outlook have increased with rising trade tensions. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy rebounded strongly in Q2, after modest growth in Q1, on the back of rising personal consumption expenditures and exports. In the Euro Area, weak growth in Q1 continued in Q2 due to subdued consumer demand, weighed down by political uncertainty and a strong currency. In Japan, recent data on retail sales, consumer confidence and business sentiment point to moderation in growth. Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) has slowed somewhat 7. on volatile and elevated oil prices, mounting trade tensions and tightening of financial conditions. The Chinese economy lost some pace in Q2, pulled down by efforts to contain debt. The Russian economy picked up in Q1; recent data on employment, industrial production and exports indicate that the economy has gained further momentum. South Africa\u2019s economy contracted in Q1; though consumer sentiment has improved, high unemployment and weak exports pose challenges. In Brazil, economic activity suffered a setback in Q1 on nation-wide strikes; more recent data suggest that growth remained muted as industrial production contracted in May and the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) declined. 8. Global trade lost some traction due to intensification of trade wars and uncertainty stemming from Brexit negotiations. Crude oil prices, which remained volatile and elevated in May-June on a delicate demand-supply balance, eased modestly in the second half of July on higher supply from Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers. Base metal prices have fallen on the general risk-off sentiment triggered by fears of an intensification of trade wars. Gold prices have softened on a stronger dollar. Inflation remained firm in the US, reflecting higher oil prices and stronger aggregate demand. Inflation has edged up also in some other major advanced and emerging economies, driven, in part, by rising energy prices and pass-through effects from currency depreciations. 9. Financial markets have continued to be driven mainly by monetary policy stances in major AEs and geopolitical tensions. Equity markets in AEs have declined on trade tensions and uncertainty relating to Brexit negotiations. Investors\u2019 appetite for EME assets has waned on increases in interest rates by the US Fed. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US has moderated somewhat from its peak on May 17 on safe-haven demand, spurred by escalating trade conflicts. Yields have softened in other key AEs as well. In most EMEs, however, movements in yields have varied reflecting domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and tightening global liquidity. Capital flows to EMEs declined in anticipation of monetary policy tightening in AEs. In currency markets, the US dollar appreciated, supported by strong economic data. The euro strengthened in June on receding political uncertainty and taper talk by the central bank. However, the currency has traded soft thereafter on mixed economic data and the rising US dollar. EME currencies, in general, have depreciated against the US dollar over the last month. On the domestic front, south-west monsoon has been recovering after a brief spell of 10. deficiency in the second half of June. The cumulative rainfall up to July 31, 2018 was 6 per cent below the long-period average. In terms of spatial distribution, 28 of the 36 sub-divisions received normal or excess rainfall, whereas 8 sub-divisions received deficient rainfall as against three sub-divisions last year. The total sown area of kharif crops as on July 27 was 7.5 per cent lower than that a year ago. The live storage in major reservoirs as on July 26 was at 41 per cent of the full reservoir level compared with 36 per cent a year ago, which portends well for the rabi sowing season. 11. Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), strengthened in April-May 2018 on a y-o-y basis. This was driven mainly by a significant turnaround in the production of capital goods and consumer durables. Growth in the infrastructure/construction sector accelerated sharply, reflecting the government\u2019s thrust on national highways and rural housing, while the growth of consumer non-durables decelerated significantly. The output of eight core industries accelerated in June due to higher production in petroleum refinery products, steel, coal and cement. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector remains robust. The assessment based on the Reserve Bank\u2019s business expectations index (BEI) for Q1:2018-19 remained optimistic notwithstanding some softening in production, order books and exports. The July manufacturing PMI remained in expansion zone, although it eased from its level a month ago with slower growth in output, new orders and employment. 12. Several high-frequency indicators of services activity increased at a faster pace in May- June. Tractor and two-wheeler sales growth accelerated significantly, suggesting strong rural demand. Passenger vehicle sales growth, an indicator of urban demand, also strengthened. Commercial vehicle sales growth remained robust despite some deceleration. Domestic air passenger traffic \u2013 another indicator of urban demand \u2013 maintained double-digit growth. Construction activity indicators also improved with cement production sustaining double digit growth for the eighth consecutive month in June. Steel consumption also accelerated in May. The services PMI expanded to a twelve-month high in June, after a marginal contraction in May, supported by expansion in new business and employment. 13. Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, rose from 4.9 per cent in May to 5 per cent in June, driven by an uptick in inflation in fuel and in items other than food and fuel even as food inflation remained muted due to lower than usual seasonal uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables in summer months. Adjusting for the estimated impact of the 7th central pay commission\u2019s house rent allowances (HRA), headline inflation increased from 4.5 per cent in May to 4.6 per cent in June. Low inflation continued in cereals, meat, milk, oil, spices and non-alcoholic beverages, and pulses and sugar prices remained in deflation. 14. Fuel and light group inflation rose sharply, pulled up by liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene. Inflation in firewood and chips ticked up, while electricity inflation remained low. The pass-through of global crude oil prices impacted inflation in domestic petroleum products as well as transport services. Inflation also picked up modestly in respect of education and health. 15. The June round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of households reported a further uptick of 20 basis points in inflation expectations for both three-month and one-year ahead horizons as compared with the last round. Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey (IOS) reported higher input costs and selling prices in Q1:2018-19. The manufacturing PMI showed that input prices eased slightly in July, although they remained high. Input costs for companies polled in Services PMI in June also stayed elevated. Farm and non-farm input costs rose significantly. Notwithstanding some pick-up in February and March 2018, rural wage growth remained moderate, while wage growth in the organised sector remained firm. 16. Systemic liquidity remained generally in surplus mode during June-July 2018. In June, the Reserve Bank absorbed surplus liquidity of around \u20b9140 billion on a daily net average basis under the LAF even as the system migrated from net surplus to a net deficit mode in the second half of the month due to advance tax outflows. Interest rates in the overnight call money market firmed up in June reflecting the increase in the repo rate on June 6, 2018. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded, on an average, 12 basis points below the repo rate \u2013 the same as in May. Systemic liquidity moved back into surplus mode in early July with increased government spending but turned into deficit from July 10 onwards; on a daily net average basis, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity under the LAF of \u20b9107 billion in July. The WACR in July, on an average, traded 9 basis points below the policy rate. Based on an assessment of prevailing liquidity conditions and of durable liquidity needs going forward, the Reserve Bank conducted two open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions of \u20b9100 billion each on June 21 and July 19, 2018. 17. Export growth picked up in May and June 2018 on a y-o-y basis, aided by engineering goods, petroleum products, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. Import growth also accelerated largely due to an increase in crude oil prices. Among non-oil imports, gold imports declined due to lower volume, while imports of machinery, coal, electronic goods, chemicals, and iron and steel increased sharply. Double-digit import growth in May and June pushed up the trade deficit. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows improved significantly in the first two months of 2018-19. With the tightening of liquidity conditions in AEs, growing geopolitical concerns and with the escalation of protectionist sentiment, net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows from the domestic capital market have continued, albeit at an increasingly slower rate. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 404.2 billion on July 27, 2018. Outlook 18. In the second bi-monthly resolution of 2018-19, CPI inflation for 2018-19 was projected at 4.8-4.9 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside. Excluding the impact of HRA revisions, CPI inflation was projected at 4.6 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2. Actual inflation outcomes have been slightly below the projected trajectory as the seasonal summer surge in vegetable prices has remained somewhat muted in comparison with its past behaviour and fruits prices have declined. 19. The inflation outlook is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, the central government has decided to fix the minimum support prices (MSPs) of at least 150 per cent of the cost of production for all kharif crops for the sowing season of 2018-19. This increase in MSPs for kharif crops, which is much larger than the average increase seen in the past few years, will have a direct impact on food inflation and second round effects on headline inflation. A part of the increase in MSPs based on historical trends was already included in the June baseline projections. As such, only the incremental increase in MSPs over the average increase in the past will impact inflation projections. However, there is a considerable uncertainty and the exact impact would depend on the nature and scale of the government\u2019s procurement operations. Second, the overall performance of the monsoon so far augurs well for food inflation in the medium-term. Third, crude oil prices have moderated slightly, but remain at elevated levels. Fourth, the central government has reduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on several goods and services. This will have some direct moderating impact on inflation, provided there is a pass-through of reduced GST rates to retail consumers. Fifth, inflation in items excluding food and fuel has been broad-based and has risen significantly in recent months, reflecting greater pass-through of rising input costs and improving demand conditions. Finally, financial markets continue to be volatile. Based on an assessment of the above- mentioned factors, inflation is projected at 4.6 per cent in Q2, 4.8 per cent in H2 of 2018-19 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 4.4 per cent in Q2, 4.7-4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20. 20. Turning to the growth outlook, various indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to be strong. The progress of the monsoon so far and a sharper than the usual increase in MSPs of kharif crops are expected to boost rural demand by raising farmers\u2019 income. Robust corporate earnings, especially of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, also reflect buoyant rural demand. Investment activity remains firm even as there has been some tightening of financing conditions in the recent period. Increased FDI flows in recent months and continued buoyant domestic capital market conditions bode well for investment activity. The Reserve Bank\u2019s IOS indicates that activity in the manufacturing sector is expected to remain robust in Q2, though there may be some moderation in pace. Rising trade tensions may, however, have an adverse impact on India\u2019s exports. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth projection for 2018-19 is retained, as in the June statement, at 7.4 per cent, ranging 7.5-7.6 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2, with risks evenly balanced; GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 is projected at 7.5 per cent (Chart 2). 21. Even as inflation projections for Q2 have been revised marginally downwards vis-\u00e0-vis the June statement, projections for Q3 onwards remain broadly unchanged. Several risks persist. First, crude oil prices continue to be volatile and vulnerable to both upside and downside risks. In particular, while geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions remain an upside risk to oil prices, the fall in global demand due to further intensification of protectionist trade policies could pull down oil prices. Second, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Third, households\u2019 inflation expectations, as measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, have risen significantly in the last two rounds, which could influence actual inflation outcomes in the months to come. Fourth, manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey have reported hardening of input price pressures in Q2 of 2018-19. However, if the recent softening of global commodity prices persists, it could mitigate some of the upward pressure on input costs. Fifth, though the monsoon has been normal temporally so far, its regional distribution needs to be carefully monitored in the context of key CPI components such as paddy. Sixth, in case there is fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it could have adverse implications for market volatility, crowd out private investment and impact the outlook for inflation. Seventh, uncertainty around the full impact of MSP on inflation will only resolve in the next several months once the price support schemes are implemented. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through, there is need to watch out for any second- round impact on inflation. 22. Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. 23. The MPC notes that domestic economic activity has continued to sustain momentum and the output gap has virtually closed. However, uncertainty around domestic inflation needs to be carefully monitored in the coming months. In addition, recent global developments raise some concerns. Rising trade protectionism poses a grave risk to near-term and long-term global growth prospects by adversely impacting investment, disrupting global supply chains and hampering productivity. Geopolitical tensions and elevated oil prices continue to be the other sources of risk to global growth. 24. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of the decision; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted against the decision. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by August 16, 2018. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from October 3 to 5, 2018. Voting on the Resolution to increase the policy repo rate by 25 bps to 6.5 per cent Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Dr. Urjit R. Patel 26. Since the last policy, demand conditions in the manufacturing sector have continued to improve. There is a significant improvement in the risk profile of the firms in most sub-sectors based on corporate results for H2:17-18. There is a noticeable improvement in consumer confidence, although the current situation index continues to be in the pessimistic zone. Organized sector wages \u2013 a proxy for pay inflation \u2013 continue to rise and need to be carefully watched. The increase in capacity utilization has coincided with better corporate performance. The Services PMI also expanded to a 12 month high in June. 27. On the expenditure side, private consumption (PFCE) continues to be the main driver of growth, and it will be further supported by a shift in the terms of trade towards agriculture, and the likelihood of a normal monsoon. Economic growth in the short run will also be buoyed by a political business cycle. The adverse implications of a political business cycle on fiscal consolidation should be carefully watched since fiscal consolidation is often a key feature of the adjustment required to contain trade imbalances. High frequency indicators on consumption suggest a mild tapering in the growth momentum since the last policy. Headline IIP also softened to 3.2% in May compared to 4.8% in April. Overall, I remain sanguine about current and medium term growth prospects. 28. One year projections of headline inflation (ex HRA) continue to durably persist above 4%, as in the last policy. CPI inflation ex food and fuel has continued to sustain above 6%, with strong momentum effects. On the positive side, this reflects a closing output gap. Favorable base effects will also prevail over a 12 month horizon for the ex food and fuel and ex HRA group, which will slow down CPI ex food and fuel and ex HRA inflation. Food inflation continues to be maverick. It ranged between 1.7% and 2.1% in Q1:18-19 and is the reason for the May-June 2018 undershoot of projections. Except food, all other groups contributed to an increase in headline inflation in the last few months. For instance, there is a tangible rise in price pressures in the miscellaneous sub-group (health, education, transport) in the last three months, possibly reflecting supply constraints in these sectors. Food inflation surprises continue to be one way, which is a puzzle. Crude prices have inched down, although the average price of crude remains elevated with risks persisting. 29. Both 3 month and 1 year ahead inflationary expectations have also hardened, which is worrisome. If inflationary expectations are well anchored, the 1 year ahead inflationary expectations should be less sensitive to \u201cnews\u201d shocks (such as the recent elevated levels of the price of crude) compared to the 3 month level. The fact that median inflationary expectations (both 3 month and the 1 year ahead) in the last round increased roughly by the same amount (20 basis points) compared to the last policy suggests that much work lies ahead in making monetary policy more credible and anchoring inflationary expectations. One more risk that has crystallized to the upside since the June review is the recent 30. announcement of minimum support prices for Kharif crops for 2018. The weighted average increase in MSP, based on CPI weights, for 2018-2019 works out to 17%. Compared to this, the average increase in MSP for 2014-2015 to 2017-2018 was 3.6%. Higher MSPs of this magnitude have the potential of pushing headline inflation sustainably and significantly beyond the 4 percent target for headline inflation mandated in the RBI Act. While the final inflationary impact will depend on the exact procurement policy which is yet to be announced, given the magnitude of the MSP surprise, it is opportune to frontload a rate hike, somewhat akin to an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d. In this regard, it will be crucial to watch how the twin terms trade of shocks \u2013 referenced to in my last few statements \u2013 play out on macroeconomic aggregates in the coming months. For these reasons, I vote for an increase in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points at 31. today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. 32. Headline inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, rose to 5% in June 2018 from 4.9% in May due to a broad-based rise across its sub-indices. The pass-through of elevated global oil prices in the domestic economy directly affected prices of LPG, petroleum products and transport services. Inflation in education and health also increased modestly. Food inflation, however, declined marginally between May and June, partly due to a favourable base effect and also because of a decline in prices of fruits and soft inflation in vegetables. Inflation excluding food and fuel hovered above 6% and is a cause for concern. Moreover, high input costs and selling prices were reflected in the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) for the first quarter of 2018-19. Companies covered in the Services PMI in June also highlighted high input costs as did those polled for the Manufacturing PMI in July. 33. Going forward, several upside risks to inflation remain. First, a larger than average increase in the minimum support prices (MSPs) for all kharif crops for the sowing season of 2018-19 is likely to have a direct impact on inflation in the food group as well as secondary effects through greater purchasing power in rural areas. However, the extent of impact will depend on the nature and scope of implementation of procurement by the government. The tapering impact of HRA revisions for central government employees and the staggered impact of HRA revisions by state governments may also push headline inflation up. Further, crude oil prices remain above $70 and future movements are expected to be volatile, depending on geopolitical events and their impact on global demand. Volatility in global financial markets also continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Additionally, fiscal slippages by governments may have adverse implications for market volatility, and may crowd out private investment and impact the outlook for inflation. Moreover, the June round of RBI\u2019s survey of households shows an increase in inflation expectations at the three-month and one-year horizons. Elevated input costs also pose a risk for further inflation in the coming months, although there is some potential for easing due to softening global commodity prices. Downside risks also include a normal southwest monsoon, which should help contain food inflation in the medium-term. Additionally, reduction in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates may cool down inflation to the extent of a pass-through of reduced GST rates to retail consumers. 34. The use-based classification of the index of industrial production (IIP) shows that industrial growth has strengthened in recent months on account of growth in capital goods and consumer durables. Central government schemes concerning building of highways and rural housing have contributed towards acceleration of growth in the infrastructure and construction sectors. While the July manufacturing PMI remained in expansion mode, it eased relative to the previous month. The business expectations index (BEI) of RBI for Q1:2018-19 remained in optimistic zone. Further, the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey suggests that manufacturing sector activity is expected to remain robust in Q2. According to the June Round of the Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by the Reserve Bank of India, the Current Situation Index, an indicator of the current state of the economy, rose modestly after dropping in the previous two rounds. This rise was largely driven by an improvement in sentiment on the general economic situation and employment scenario as well as an increase in spending. 35. At the same time, the Future Expectations Index that depicts consumer outlook fell marginally in the June round. This was driven by a slight drop in sentiments on the one-year ahead general economic situation and the deterioration in the outlook on income. Downside risks to growth also include rising trade tensions that may hamper demand for India\u2019s exports, aggravating the cyclical slowdown in exports signalled by the continued downswing in the growth rate of the Indian Leading Exports Index maintained by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York. This is consistent with the global economic slowdown predicted earlier by ECRI's international leading indexes. 36. Thus, with hardening of actual inflation, rising inflation expectations along with prevailing upside risks to inflation, I vote for an increase in the repo rate by 25 basis points while retaining the neutral stance. 37. After the last meeting of the MPC in June 2018, the monthly headline inflation prints for May and June have turned out to be less than expected by the RBI and, as I had pointed out a possibility in my last statement, have resulted in lowering the forecast for Q4:2018-19. The current forecast of RBI does not show this decline and on the contrary shows an increase by about 20 bps only because it incorporates a remotely possible impact of MSP revisions on the headline inflation. Such an impact, on the other hand, is so uncertain even in its existence and definitely in magnitude that experts in the field advise to wait and watch till the revised MSP is implemented on ground by November 2018. There are so many well-known constraints on its implementation that prudence lies in not basing any policy rate decisions till clarity emerges on it. Once we take this crucial uncertain factor out, the rest of the developments do not warrant any change in the status quo even with a very conservative view. I, therefore, vote for the status quo both in the policy repo rate and the neutral stance. More specific reasons for my vote are: i) The argument of a pre-emptive consecutive rate hike at this stage pre-supposes: (a) complete failure of the rate hike effected in the June 2018 policy on impacting the inflationary expectations in the economy, and (b) headline inflation forecasts ex-house rent revisions a year ahead increasing further without any uncertainty. Neither of these two pre-suppositions is correct. Although the RBI survey of the household inflationary expectations shows an increase in its median quantum by 20 bps, the proportion of respondents expecting higher inflation 12 months ahead declined noticeably. Moreover, the IIMA Business Inflation Expectation Survey conducted in June 2018 (after the repo rate hike by 25 bps) shows a sharp decline in the headline CPI inflation expectation 12 months ahead from 4.67 percent in the April 2018 round to 4.16 percent in the June 2018 round. This survey covered more than 1600 companies and shows low standard deviation. There are several reasons why the second pre-supposition is incorrect. ii) The Central and State governments have shown reasonable commitment to the fiscal discipline in terms of bringing the fiscal deficit down. There is no reason to expect a substantial fiscal slippage this year despite the next year being an election year. iii) GST rate reductions on several items may reduce the inflation marginally. iv) Inflationary expectations of urban households have increased as per the RBI survey because two consecutive inflation readings (May and June 2018) increased. They are likely to fall when the next two consecutive readings (July and August 2018) would show a decline. Even RBI inflation forecasts point to this possibility on account of the strong base effects. If the actual fall in CPI inflation for July and August 2018 turns out to be larger than what RBI projected, their 12 month ahead inflation forecast may also show a reduction. Given the recent track record of RBI in terms of their near term forecasts, this possibility cannot be ruled out. v) Concerns about core inflation are misplaced on two counts: (a) the mandated target for our Committee is headline CPI inflation including food and fuel; and (b) my paper with a co-author in the Economic and Political Weekly (March 3, 2018) shows that inflation dynamics have changed during the last decade such that it is the core that adjusts to the headline and not vice-versa. vi) The oil prices have not further increased. If at all, they show a marginal decline from $75 in early June 2018 to $72.5 towards the end of July 2018. All these factors together would bring down the baseline inflation forecast for Q4:2018-19. Only the most uncertain impact of MSP revisions on food prices after 2 or 3 quarters can push the inflation forecast marginally higher. In my opinion, we should not consider such a highly uncertain impact for a rate hike decision. vii) On the other hand, there are disturbing signals and evidences pointing to likely slow down on the growth front. Capacity utilization seasonally adjusted has sharply fallen by 130 bps as per the RBI survey. It contradicts the RBI claim that output gap has closed. Actually, it is not getting closed, but is likely to widen creating downward pressure on wages and prices. viii) Corporate performance points to less investment in fixed and financial assets in H2:2017-18 and is also likely to fall during 2018-19 as revealed by the pipeline projects up to 2017-18. Bonds and debentures issues by the private sector declined in Q1:2018- 19. ix) Global growth is not likely to sustain. Our exports may not grow at the envisaged rate due to tariff wars and increased protectionism. x) Real policy rate is already positive and very high compared to most other countries. For businesses, it is well above +2 percent (since their inflation expectation 12 months ahead is only 4.16 percent). It is already adversely impacting capital formation. All these factors will put further downward pressure on inflation. 38. to tinker with the policy stance. Prudence lies in maintaining status quo on both. This is certainly not the time and environment to hike the policy rate. Nor is it the time 39. operating target with the policy action. I vote for raising the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and for accordingly aligning the 40. First, inflation has hardened through the first quarter of the year, extending its upturn into the third consecutive month in June. The forecast \u2013 the intermediate target that provides a proximate view of how the goal variables are forming \u2013 suggests that inflation is likely to encounter a soft patch in the second quarter, but it will resume an upward trajectory in the second half of the year. Second, the recent softening of international crude prices has afforded some respite 41. from inflation pressures. The outlook, though, is clouded with uncertainty as to how geopolitical inventory tensions, OPEC production commitments, global demand and adjustments will play out. It is prudent to prepare for international crude prices remaining elevated and volatile for some time. 42. Third, the recent experience is suffused with global spillovers impacting the bond and forex markets in India. Apart from implications for growth and external sustainability, financial turbulence feeding into volatile inflation outcomes is a real and present risk. 43. Fourth, the inflationary consequences of MSP revisions remain an upside risk. The pass-through of the announced MSPs to retail inflation is conditioned by two big unknowns: (a) the scale and ambit of procurement operations when they commence in Q3; and (b) the pace of drawdown of stocks in the case of paddy, the main crop for effective procurement in the Kharif season. A fair assumption can be that it will not be business as usual in view of the size of increases in MSPs this year that fulfils the commitment given in the Union Budget, and the timing of the announcement. 44. That said, the inflation trajectory is expected to slant upwards in the third and fourth quarters of 2018-19 and in the first quarter of the next financial year. Households and professional forecasters are anticipating it, corporates are reporting rising input costs which could swiftly translate into pricing power as the output gap closes and demand pressures build up. Consumers are pessimistic about the future course of the price situation. 45. The risk of failing to achieve the inflation target, and of being perceived as willing to accommodate deviations over the remaining period for which the MPC is tasked, has increased significantly. This could unhinge inflation expectations, dent the credibility of the MPC and allow inflation outcomes to test the upper tolerance band. This evolving configuration warrants an adequate monetary policy response, so that inflation realigns with the target and inflation expectations remain anchored. The economy is poised for an acceleration of growth in 2018-19 relative to 2017-18, 46. but the drivers of growth are amorphous at this juncture. International crude prices and global spillovers from trade wars, monetary policy normalisation and geopolitical tensions present significant risks to growth prospects. In this highly volatile and unsettled international environment, stability has to be secured on an enduring basis to enable the drivers of growth to gain traction and to preserve external viability. 47. My preference, therefore, is to reinforce the policy action that commenced in June with another policy rate increase now and to allow the accumulated policy impulse to work its way through the economy, while vigil is maintained on the expected rising path of inflation going forward. The softer inflation prints expected in Q2 could likely lull inflation expectations, but abundant precaution and decisiveness in quelling risks to the target is warranted if the hard- earned gains in terms of macroeconomic stability and credibility have to be preserved. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 48. Since the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met last in June 2018, inflation prints have been somewhat softer than the Reserve Bank\u2019s projections. Notably, vegetables and fruits prices have surprised on the downside. However, the underlying inflation as reflected in \u201cex food fuel\u201d segment, especially in petrol and diesel, transportation (including fares), education fees, health services and clothing persists, and does not augur well for headline inflation going forward. The last three rounds of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)\u2019s Inflation Expectations 49. Survey (IES) of households reflect hardening of the 3-month ahead and 12-month ahead inflation expectations by 110 basis points (bps) and 150 bps, respectively. The input cost pressures faced by the corporate sector are also reported to be robust. These outcomes are not surprising given that headline inflation \u2013 even after adjusting for the statistical effect of the Centre\u2019s increase in house rent allowances (HRA) \u2013 has remained above 4%, the MPC\u2019s mandated target headline inflation rate, for seven out of the past eight months, with a mean as well as median of slightly over 4.5%. 50. Benign food inflation continues to act as a factor pulling forecasts down. It remains to be seen if the usual summer seasonal pickup in food inflation will simply be delayed by a month or two, or it is a feature of supply-driven soft food inflation prints. However, the major upside risk to food inflation that MPC had highlighted in its past resolutions, viz., the award of minimum support prices (MSPs), has materialised. There is now a concrete announcement detailing the targeted kharif crops and a much higher than the normal MSP increase. Though significant uncertainty remains regarding the exact rollout of the MSP program, inflation projections by the Reserve Bank include the impact of MSP under reasonable procurement assumptions. 51. Oil prices have moderated somewhat compared with two months back due to an increase in supply from some of the OPEC countries and Russia. Nevertheless, the price of the Indian crude basket remains at elevated levels and is just a throw away from levels that can cause domestic inflation to rise sharply. Hence, while the supply response has had some softening impact on the projections, oil price gyrations remain an important risk going forward. 52. Factoring in these considerations, I am more concerned about upside risks materialising compared to downside risks. This is especially so as most real-time indicators suggest that growth recovery is likely to be sustainable. As I have mentioned in the past few minutes, estimates suggest that the output gap has more or less closed. In summary, since past several headline inflation prints have been above the target and 53. projections suggest this will also be the case over the medium term, I vote to raise the policy rate by 25 basis points (bps) as a step towards fulfilling our inflation targeting mandate while paying attention to growth. The rate hike of June followed by another rate hike will help rein in demand pressures and manage inflation expectations. However, this transmission will occur with a lag. Since that is somewhat far and there is an important interim uncertainty in the form of tariff wars which can rock global growth, financial markets and inflation in abrupt and unexpected ways, I vote to retain the neutral stance of monetary policy. Inflation as measured by CPI ex HRA has risen for the third consecutive month in June 54. 2018, driven by a broad-based increase in inflation in non-food goods and services. Continuing elevated crude oil prices have kept retail prices of petroleum products high; this has also resulted in higher inflation in transport services. Furthermore, inflation increased in education, health and clothing. In contrast, inflation in the food group remained benign due to a decline in prices of fruits and lower than the usual seasonal uptick in prices of vegetables. On the whole, actual inflation outcomes since the last MPC resolution of June 2018 have been slightly below the projected trajectory as food inflation has continued to surprise on the downside. 55. Going forward, excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 4.7-4.8 per cent in H2:2018-19; and 5 per cent in Q1:2019-20. These projections include the impact of an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops announced by the central government over what was already assumed in projections in the June policy. The outlook for inflation, however, is faced with both upside and downside risks such as (i) considerable uncertainty around the full impact of MSP changes on inflation, which will be known only in the coming months when the procurement details are available and execution takes place; (ii) susceptibility of crude oil to both supply and demand shocks; (iii) continuing volatility in financial markets; (iv) a further rise in inflation expectations of households which has the potential to feed into wage & salary increases and induce cost-push pressures; (v) fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels; and (vi) second round effects on inflation on account of the staggered HRA revisions by various state governments, though the direct statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through. Domestic growth impulses continue to be reasonably strong. The normal monsoon so 56. far augurs well for the farm sector. Investment activity has remained broadly positive. The manufacturing sector has continued to be robust. Several high frequency indicators of services activity have expanded at a faster pace in recent months. However, rising trade protectionism may impact domestic investment and growth prospects by dampening India\u2019s exports. Overall, economic activity appears to be buoyant with GDP growth for 2018-19 projected at 7.4 per cent, same as in the June policy; and 7.5 per cent for Q1:2019-20. As inflation risks have continued to be elevated, I vote for an increase in the policy repo 57. rate by 25 basis points; this action is a necessary step towards securing the mandated 4 per cent inflation target on a durable basis. However, in view of several uncertainties that are present, I maintain the neutral stance of monetary policy. ", "file12": "the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from December 3-5, 2018 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Institute of Management, Ravindra H. Dholakia, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. Indian 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.5 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 6.25 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the stance of calibrated tightening of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Since the last MPC meeting in October 2018, global economic activity has 6. shown increasing signs of weakness on rising trade tensions. Among advanced economies (AEs), economic activity appears to be slowing in the US in Q4:2018, after a buoyant Q3. The Euro area growth lost pace in Q3, impacted by weaker trade growth and new vehicle emission standards. The Japanese economy contracted in Q3 on subdued external and domestic demand. 7. Economic activity also decelerated in major emerging market economies (EMEs) in Q3. In China, growth slowed down on weak domestic demand. The ongoing trade tensions and the possible cooling of the housing market pose major risks to growth in China. The Russian economy lost some traction, pulled down largely by a weak agriculture harvest, though the growth was buttressed by strong performance of the energy sector. The Brazilian economy seems to be recovering gradually from the economic disruption in the first half of the year. The South African economy expanded in Q3, after contracting in the previous two quarters, driven by agriculture and manufacturing. 8. Crude oil prices have declined sharply, reflecting higher supplies and easing of geo-political tensions. Base metal prices have continued to decline on selling pressure following weak demand from major economies. Gold price has risen underpinned by safe haven demand triggered by political uncertainty in some geographies, though a strong dollar may stem the rise. The inflation scenario has remained broadly unchanged in the US and the Euro area. In many key EMEs, however, inflation has risen, though the recent retreat in energy prices, tightening of policy stances by central banks and stabilising of currencies may have a salutary impact, going forward. Global financial markets have been driven mainly by rising policy rates in the 9. US, volatile crude oil prices and expectations of a slowdown compared with earlier projections. Among AEs, equity markets in the US witnessed a selloff on the weakening outlook for corporate earnings caused by rising borrowing costs, while the European stock markets declined on political uncertainties. The Japanese stock market also shed gains on global cues and the gradual strengthening of the yen. EM stock markets have corrected on shrinking global liquidity, weak economic data in some key EMEs, and lingering trade tensions. The 10-year yield in the US, which surged on robust economic data at the beginning of October, softened subsequently on the unchanged Fed stance. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area and Japan softened on weak economic sentiment and idiosyncratic factors. In most EMEs, bond yields have softened in recent weeks on falling crude oil prices and steadying currencies. In currency markets, the US dollar, which was strengthening on a widening growth differential with its peers, eased in the second half of November. The euro has weakened on Brexit and budget concerns in Italy, while the yen appreciated on safe haven buying in November. EME currencies have been trading with an appreciating bias, supported by a sharp decline in crude oil prices and conservative domestic monetary policy stances. 10. On the domestic front, gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed down to 7.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2018-19, after four consecutive quarters of acceleration, weighed down by moderation in private consumption and a large drag from net exports. Private consumption slowed down possibly on account of moderation in rural demand, subdued growth in kharif output, depressed prices of agricultural commodities and sluggish growth in rural wages. However, growth in government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) strengthened, buoyed by higher spending by the central government. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by double-digits for the third consecutive quarter, driven mainly by the public sector\u2019s thrust on national highways and rural infrastructure, which was also reflected in robust growth in cement production and steel consumption. Growth of imports accelerated at a much faster pace than that of exports, resulting in net exports pulling down aggregate demand. 11. On the supply side, growth of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices decelerated to 6.9 per cent in Q2, reflecting moderation in agricultural and industrial activities. Slowdown in agricultural GVA was largely the outcome of tepid growth in kharif production. Within industry, growth in manufacturing decelerated due to lower profitability of manufacturing firms, pulled down largely by a rise in input costs, while that in mining and quarrying turned negative, caused by a contraction in output of crude oil and natural gas. Growth in electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services strengthened. Services sector growth remained unchanged at the previous quarter\u2019s level. Of its constituents, growth in construction activity decelerated sequentially, but it was much higher on a y-o-y basis. Growth in public administration and defence services accelerated sharply. 12. Looking beyond Q2, rabi sowing so far (up to end-November) has been 8.3 per cent lower as compared with the same period last year due mainly to lower soil moisture levels resulting from a deficient monsoon and a delayed kharif harvest across states. Precipitation during the north-east monsoon as on November 28 was 49 per cent below the long period average. Storage in major reservoirs, the main source of irrigation during the rabi season, was at 61 per cent of the full reservoir level as on November 29. 13. Growth in the index of industrial production (IIP) slowed down to 4.5 per cent in September 2018. Capacity utilisation (CU), measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS), increased from 73.8 per cent in Q1 to 76.1 per cent in Q2, which was higher than the long-term average of 74.9 per cent; seasonally adjusted CU also increased to 76.4 per cent. Available high frequency indicators suggest that industrial activity has been improving in Q3. The growth in core industries recovered in October on the back of double-digit expansion in coal, cement and electricity. The purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for manufacturing touched an eleven-month high of 54.0 in November, supported by an expansion in output, and domestic and export orders. According to the assessment of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS), the overall business sentiment in Q3 remained stable, with sustained optimism about production and exports. High frequency indicators of service sector activity showed a mixed picture in 14. September-October. Growth in tractors sales \u2013 an indicator of rural demand \u2013 turned negative in September. Growth in two-wheeler sales, another indicator of rural demand, rebounded in October, supported by a base effect. Growth in passenger vehicles sales \u2013 an indicator of urban demand \u2013 turned marginally positive in October, after three consecutive months of negative growth coincident with changes in mandatory long-term third-party insurance requirements and a sharp increase in fuel prices. Commercial vehicle sales growth remained robust in September-October, despite some deceleration. Railway freight traffic improved markedly in October to touch a five-year high growth. While domestic air passenger traffic sustained robust growth, international passenger traffic contracted. PMI for services registered a sharp uptick in November, driven by new business. The composite PMI output index touched a two-year high of 54.5 in November. 15. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in CPI, declined from 3.7 per cent in September to 3.3 per cent in October. A large fall in food prices pushed food group into deflation and more than offset the increase in inflation in items excluding food and fuel. Adjusting for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, headline inflation was 3.1 per cent in October. 16. Within the food and beverages group, deflation in vegetables, pulses and sugar deepened in October. Among other items, there was a broad-based softening across food items, especially cereals, milk, fruits and prepared meals. Milk and milk products inflation softened caused by surplus supplies in the domestic market. Fruits inflation moderated, while prepared meals registered a price decline for the first time in the CPI series. Inflation, however, showed an uptick in meat and fish, and non- alcoholic beverages. 17. Inflation in the fuel and light group remained elevated, driven by liquefied petroleum gas prices in October, tracking international petroleum product prices. Kerosene prices also edged up, reflecting their administered price. However, electricity prices softened in October. Inflation in rural fuel items such as firewood and chips and dung cake also moderated. in 18. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel accelerated to 6.1 per cent in October; adjusted for the estimated HRA impact, it was 5.9 per cent. Transport and communication registered a marked increase, pulled up by higher petroleum product prices, transportation fares and prices of automobiles. A broad-based increase was also observed in health, household goods and services, and personal care and effects. However, inflation moderated significantly in clothing and footwear, as also housing on waning of the HRA impact of central government employees. 19. Inflation expectations of households, measured by the November 2018 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, softened by 40 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon over the last round reflecting decline in food and petroleum product prices, while they remained unchanged for the twelve-month ahead horizon. Producers\u2019 assessment for input prices inflation eased marginally in Q3 as reported by manufacturing firms polled by the Reserve Bank\u2019s IOS. Domestic farm and industrial input costs remained high. Rural wage growth remained muted in Q2, while staff cost growth in the manufacturing sector remained elevated. 20. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate on 14 out of 21 days in October, on all 18 days in November and both days in December (December 3 and 4). The WACR traded below the repo rate on an average by 5 basis points in October, 9 basis points in November and 16 basis points in December. There was large currency expansion in October and especially during the festive season in November. Currency in circulation, however, contracted in each of the last three weeks in November. Liquidity needs arising from the growth in currency and the Reserve Bank\u2019s forex operations were met through a mixture of tools based on an assessment of the evolving liquidity conditions. The Reserve Bank injected durable liquidity amounting to \u20b9360 billion in October and \u20b9500 billion in November through open market purchase operations, bringing total durable liquidity injection to \u20b91.36 trillion for 2018-19. Liquidity injected under the LAF, on an average daily net basis, was \u20b9560 billion in October, \u20b9806 billion in November and \u20b9105 billion in December (up to December 4). 21. India\u2019s merchandise exports rebounded in October 2018, after moderating in the previous month, driven mainly by petroleum products, engineering goods, chemicals, electronics, readymade garments, and gems and jewellery. Imports also grew at a faster pace in October relative to the previous month, contributed mainly by petroleum products and electronic goods. Consequently, the trade deficit widened in October 2018 sequentially as also in comparison with the level a year ago. Provisional data suggest a modest improvement in net exports of services in Q2:2018-19, which augurs well for the current account balance. On the financing side, net FDI flows moderated in April-September 2018. Portfolio flows turned positive in November on account of a sharp decline in oil prices, indications of a less hawkish stance by the US Fed and a softer US dollar. However, during the year, there were net portfolio outflows of US$ 14.8 billion (up to November 30). Non- resident deposits increased markedly in H1:2018-19 on a net basis over their level a year ago. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 393.7 billion on November 30, 2018. Outlook 22. In the fourth bi-monthly resolution of October 2018, CPI inflation was projected at 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.9-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the upside. Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation was projected at 3.7 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.8-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20. The actual inflation outcome in Q2 at 3.9 per cent was marginally lower than the projection of 4.0 per cent. However, the October inflation print at 3.3 per cent turned out to be unexpectedly low. 23. There have been several important developments since the October policy which will have a bearing on the inflation outlook. First, despite a significant scaling down of inflation projections in the October policy primarily due to moderation in food inflation, subsequent readings have continued to surprise on the downside with the food group slipping into deflation. At a disaggregated level, deflation in pulses, vegetables and sugar widened, while cereals inflation moderated sequentially. The broad-based weakening of food prices imparts downward bias to the headline inflation trajectory, going forward. Secondly, in contrast to the food group, there has been a broad-based increase in inflation in non-food groups. Thirdly, international crude oil prices have declined sharply since the last policy; the price of Indian crude basket collapsed to below US$ 60 a barrel by end-November after touching US$ 85 a barrel in early October. However, selling prices, as reported by firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s latest IOS, are expected to edge up further in Q4 on the back of increased demand. Fourthly, global financial markets have continued to be volatile with EME currencies showing a somewhat appreciating bias in the last one month. Finally, the effect of the 7th Central Pay Commission\u2019s HRA increase has continued to wane along expected lines. Taking all these factors into consideration and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, inflation is projected at 2.7-3.2 per cent in H2:2018-19 and 3.8-4.2 per cent in H1:2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). The projected inflation path remains unchanged after adjusting for the HRA impact of central government employees as this impact dissipates completely from December 2018 onwards. Although recent food inflation prints have surprised on the downside and prices of petroleum products have softened considerably, it is important to monitor their evolution closely and allow heightened short-term uncertainties to be resolved by incoming data. Turning to growth projections, although Q2 growth was lower than that 24. projected in the October policy, GDP growth in H1 has been broadly along the line in the April policy when for the year as a whole GDP growth was projected at 7.4 per cent. Going forward, lower rabi sowing may adversely affect agriculture and hence rural demand. Financial market volatility, slowing global demand and rising trade tensions pose negative risk to exports. However, on the positive side, the decline in crude oil prices is expected to boost India\u2019s growth prospects by improving corporate earnings and raising private consumption through higher disposable incomes. Increased capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector also portends well for new capacity additions. There has been significant acceleration in investment activity and high frequency indicators suggest that it is likely to be sustained. Credit offtake from the banking sector has continued to strengthen even as global financial conditions have tightened. FDI flows could also increase with the improving prospects of the external sector. The demand outlook as reported by firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s IOS has improved in Q4. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth for 2018-19 has been projected at 7.4 per cent (7.2-7.3 per cent in H2) as in the October policy, and for H1:2019-20 at 7.5 per cent, with risks somewhat to the downside (Chart 2). 25. Even as inflation projections have been revised downwards significantly and some of the risks pointed out in the last resolution have been mitigated, especially of crude oil prices, several uncertainties still cloud the inflation outlook. First, inflation projections incorporate benign food prices based on the realised outcomes of food inflation in recent months. The prices of several food items are at unusually low levels and there is a risk of sudden reversal, especially of volatile perishable items. Secondly, available data suggest that the effect of revision in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced in July on prices has been subdued so far. However, uncertainty continues about the exact impact of MSP on inflation, going forward. Thirdly, the medium-term outlook for crude oil prices is still uncertain due to global demand conditions, geo-political tensions and decision of OPEC which could impinge on supplies. Fourthly, global financial markets continue to be volatile. Fifthly, though households\u2019 near-term inflation expectations have moderated in the latest round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, one-year ahead expectations remain elevated and unchanged. Sixthly, fiscal slippages, if any, at the centre/state levels, will influence the inflation outlook, heighten market volatility and crowd out private investment. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by State Governments may push up headline inflation. While the MPC will look through the statistical impact of HRA revisions, it will be watchful of any second-round effects on inflation. 26. The MPC noted that the benign outlook for headline inflation is driven mainly by the unexpected softening of food inflation and collapse in oil prices in a relatively short period of time. Excluding food items, inflation has remained sticky and elevated, and the output gap remains virtually closed. The MPC also noted that even as escalating trade tensions, tightening of global financial conditions and slowing down of global demand pose some downside risks to the domestic economy, the decline in oil prices in recent weeks, if sustained, will provide tailwinds. The acceleration in investment activity also bodes well for the medium-term growth potential of the economy. The time is apposite to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. In this context, fiscal discipline is critical to create space for and crowd in private investment activity. 27. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and maintain the stance of calibrated tightening. While the decision on keeping the policy rate unchanged was unanimous, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to change the stance to neutral. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by December 19, 2018. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from February 5 to 7, 2019. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Dr. Urjit R. Patel In the October policy, I had highlighted the primacy of keeping inflationary 29. expectations anchored \u2013 whether formed rationally or adaptively \u2013 durably at the 4% target. While the one-year ahead median inflationary expectations remained unchanged at 9.8% in the latest round, the three-month median inflationary expectations declined by 40 bps to 9%. The decline in the three-month inflationary expectations number, but unchanged one-year ahead expectations number probably indicates that households don\u2019t expect the current decline in inflation to last. Notwithstanding this, these numbers bring some comfort. 30. In the October policy, I had also mentioned that two interlaced variables pose the potential of un-anchoring inflationary expectations, and thereby making it difficult to ensure price stability on an enduring basis: the nominal depreciation of the Rupee, and the increase in the price of oil. Since October, there was a substantial, though unanticipated, reversal in the price of oil, and by December, it was lower by over 29% compared to its October peak. There was also a strengthening of the Rupee by close to 4.6% (Dec 4 over Oct 5). Food inflation also fell to -0.1% in October. If oil and food prices stay lower for longer, this will help inflationary expectations taper. However, given the buoyancy in oil, and the risks of imported inflation from movements in the exchange rate, both variables need to be carefully watched. 31. The evolution of MSP-inflation dynamics also needs to be carefully watched, although this risk to inflation projections appears mitigated compared to a few months ago. 32. The elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel (6.1%) at a 3-month high continues to be problematic. Most sub-groups of inflation excluding food and fuel, other than clothing and footwear, have registered upticks. The reversal in inflation excluding food and fuel needs to be carefully watched. 33. Since the last review, overall demand conditions in the manufacturing sector have continued to remain steady. Capacity utilization in Q2 crossed its long-term average (74.9%) and is expected to gather pace going forward. The sustained acceleration in investment activity is encouraging, and this will support rising capex and a higher investment/GDP ratio. There is an improvement in the overall business situation, as tracked by the BEI for manufacturing. Both leading and coincident economic indicators for Q3 growth look good at the current juncture. Organized sector nominal wage growth continues to be high suggesting input cost pressures. 34. Consumer confidence however worsened compared to the previous round suggesting pessimism about the present. Private final consumption expenditure growth momentum also fell in Q2. Merchandise export growth in Q2 however improved relative to Q1, although on the external front, the potential for escalation of tariffs or trade tensions may slow down global growth more than expected. 35. With both the inflation and growth numbers having developed \u201csoft-spots\u201d, the appropriate risk-management approach at the current juncture would be to \u201cwait and watch.\u201d This will allow the MPC to see how various risks to both inflation and growth evolve, and better assess the ability of flexible inflation targeting to absorb the impact of shocks that the economy is currently experiencing. I therefore vote to keep the policy rate unchanged. I vote to keep the stance as 36. calibrated tightening. 37. Headline inflation softened to 3.3 per cent in October from 3.7 per cent in September, primarily due to the drop in food inflation from 1 per cent in September to -0.1 per cent in October. Headline inflation adjusted for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) of central government employees (as per RBI\u2019s estimates) also moderated from 3.5 per cent in September to 3.1 per cent in October, while CPI excluding food and fuel adjusted for the impact of an increase in HRA increased from 5.3 per cent in September to 5.9 per cent in October. At the same time, various surveys provide mixed signals regarding inflation expectations. Inflation expectations from the November round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Survey of Households softened by 40 basis points for three-month ahead expectations vis-\u00e0-vis the last round but did not change for one-year ahead expectations. The Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey indicates moderation in input prices in the third quarter of 2018-19 as reported by manufacturing firms. 38. Looking forward, downside risks to the inflation outlook include continuing moderation in food inflation and a sharp fall in crude oil prices. At the same time, the slowdown in global growth may also lead to softening of crude oil prices. On the flip side, there is also the possibility of a rebound in crude oil prices due to supply factors. Additionally, fiscal slippages by the government may have adverse implications for market volatility and impact the outlook for inflation. Upside risks associated with an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) still persist. Risks due to an increase in state level HRAs and input prices also prevail. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the inflation outlook and movements in both food inflation and crude oil prices have to be watched closely. 39. On the output side, GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018-19 slowed to 7.1 per cent from 8.2 per cent in the previous quarter. Private consumption growth moderated possibly due to easing in rural demand that may have resulted from depressed farm prices and sluggish rural wage growth although investment growth was strong partly due to government spending in infrastructure projects. At the same time, the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing rose to an eleven- month high in November reflecting an expansion in output, and orders (domestic and exports). PMI for services also rose due to new businesses. Forward looking indicators such as RBI\u2019s Business Expectations Index for the manufacturing sector signal an improvement in the fourth quarter based on upbeat sentiments on production, order books, exports and capacity utilisation. Meanwhile, growth in the Indian Leading Index, a predictor of the direction of Indian economic growth maintained by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, has risen lately, indicating some improvement in economic growth prospects. 40. Downside risks to growth include lower sowing in the rabi season, financial volatility, global slowdown and trade war, while the drop in crude oil prices and rise in credit offtake augur well for growth prospects. As of now, net exports are a drag with growth in imports sharper relative to exports growth. However, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Export Index, a predictor of the direction of exports growth, has ticked up lately, indicating a slightly brighter Indian export growth outlook, despite languishing growth in ECRI\u2019s 20-country composite Long Leading Index, which still points to a continued global growth slowdown. 41. In sum, while inflation has softened, upside risks to inflation remain. It is therefore best to pause and wait for incoming data while maintaining a vigil on inflation, especially with respect to food and crude oil. I therefore vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. At the same time, given the uncertainty with respect to the inflation outlook, I also vote for maintaining the stance of calibrated tightening. 42. Drastic and sudden changes in external economic environment have taken place after the last meeting of MPC in October 2018. Should these changes evoke a response through an appropriate policy action? - yes, if they are not purely temporary and have reasonably long term impact on the economy. RBI\u2019s own downward revision of the forecast of inflation 12 months ahead to a substantial extent in response to those developments, is a clear indication of their long-term impact on the economy. Thus, a policy response is called for. If there is no policy action in response to such a major favourable shock, MPC would run the risk of being considered neither current nor relevant! With inflation forecast coming down by around 120 basis points and quarterly growth forecasts marginally revised downward opening up output gap going forward, there is hardly any justification in retaining calibrated tightening stance. In my opinion, this would be the right time to cut the rate and bring the unduly high real interest rates in the country back to around 2 per cent. It was, however, unfortunate that in October 2018, MPC had changed its stance to calibrated tightening with 5:1 majority despite my unsuccessful persuasion to maintain neutral stance. As a result, any rate cut is off the table for now and any such action would not be advisable at this point. The best we can do under the circumstance is to hold the rate, but change the stance to neutral to take care of all possible uncertainties. We should not deny any possibility of either a rate cut or a rate hike in the near future depending on data coming in. 43. More specific reasons for my vote on the rate and the stance are: i) While the MPC resolution points largely to the upside risks to the RBI\u2019s inflation forecasts, there are downside risks that cannot be overlooked: Oil price uncertainties are on both the directions; Qatar has opted out of OPEC and it can set a trend for others; OPEC meeting can go either way; the ultimate impact on oil prices would be determined by faithful implementation of its decision by all members; and role of USA in this matter cannot be ignored. ii) Similarly, Federal Reserve has practically changed its stance on rate hikes in future. Moreover, the USA economy is not likely to be very strong over time consistently. iii) Fiscal slippage is possible but the extent of it may not warrant any panic because its impact on inflation may not be significant and will be felt, if at all, with a considerable lag. iv) Real interest rate in the economy is very high. Even ignoring the issues concerning upward bias in the current measurement of inflation, it is substantially in excess of 200 basis points and is one of the highest in the world. v) Although the MPC resolution says that inflationary expectations one year ahead as per the latest RBI survey is constant compared to the previous survey, most of the 18 cities surveyed show a decline in the household inflationary expectation one year ahead. Only a few cities show an increase that neutralizes the decline observed in majority of cities. This brings to the fore the measurement issue for inflationary expectation in quantitative terms. We should be looking at the inflationary expectations of households not only in the urban cities but also in the smaller towns and the rural areas where inflation has come down significantly in recent times. In all likelihood, their inflationary expectation would be declining. Moreover, as I have argued elsewhere (EPW, Nov. 17, 2018), there is a need to consider expectation of businesses about the CPI headline inflation. The IIMA survey on them shows a marked decline of about 30 basis points. Thus, in the aggregate, the inflationary expectation in the country as a whole one year ahead seems to be declining and not remaining the same. 44. Under such circumstances, retaining the stance of calibrated tightening seems totally inconsistent and unjustified. All these points require a change in the stance from calibrated tightening to neutral to take care of several uncertainties on both sides so that a rate decision can be appropriately data driven in future. 45. calibrated tightening. I vote for status quo on the policy repo rate and for maintaining the stance of In its October 2018 meeting, the MPC anticipated the softening of headline 46. inflation in the months ahead, revising its forecast down by 90 basis points in Q3: 2018-19 and by 30 basis points in Q4, and this sentiment was also reflected in individual minutes. The actual outturns for September and October undershot even the revised projections substantially, with prices of food unexpectedly sinking into deflation. In my view, the Indian economy is experiencing the onset of positive supply shocks as reflected in the sizable easing of prices of food and petroleum products, which could reverse. Accordingly, they should be looked through, while remaining alert to spillovers to the rest of inflation which is already elevated and rising. Households have ignored this unusual softening of inflation prints and have kept their 12-months ahead expectations unchanged, while professional forecasters have projected inflation to rise to 4.5-4.6 per cent in the first half of 2019-20. Consumers remain pessimistic about the price situation, citing it as the main factor influencing their perceptions of worsening general economic conditions. Corporates assess that input cost pressures will remain firm. Based on current reckoning, the MPC projects inflation to rise above the target in the first half of 2019-20. Taking these factors into account, I reiterate that although softer inflation prints could likely lull inflation expectations, abundant precaution and decisiveness in quelling risks to the target are warranted if the hard-earned gains in terms of macroeconomic stability and credibility are to be preserved. Turning to growth, the CSO\u2019s GDP estimates for Q2:2018-19 show a 47. sequential moderation, but this needs to be caveated by the base effect driven bump in the previous quarter; on a year-on-year basis, though, there has been a marked acceleration in aggregate demand in the first half of 2018-19 and two main engines \u2013 investment and exports \u2013 are firing. Lead/coincident indicators for Q3 \u2013 order books; capacity utilisation in manufacturing; non-food credit growth; capital goods imports; railway and port freight traffic; construction activity \u2013 all point to the momentum of growth being sustained. Annual real GDP growth will likely accelerate in 2018-19 from its level a year ago. On the production side, the momentum of activity would be underpinned by buoyancy in manufacturing and some improvement in services sector performance. 48. With average inflation gradually converging to target, these growth impulses can be maintained by ensuring that the expansion remains sustainable. It is in this context that my preference is for keeping the policy rate unchanged. With inflation projected to rise above 4 per cent over the 12-month ahead horizon, it is apposite to persevere with the stance of calibrated tightening to head off inflation pressures from potentially corroding the foundations of the growth path that is evolving over the medium-term. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 49. Since the October 2018 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, there have been two downward surprises to realised inflation. 50. First, food inflation has had an unexpectedly large collapse, again in vegetables and fruits, but somewhat more broad-based than the inflation decline in preceding months; the collapse has been sharper in rural inflation than in urban inflation. 51. Secondly, international crude oil prices that had been simmering to levels above $85 per barrel also crashed dramatically \u2013 by close to 30%. It appears that the \u201cstock out\u201d supply risk that was priced at the short end of the oil futures curve has subsided as the curve has flattened now compared to its sharp backwardation shape in early October. The oil price crash, in turn, has improved external sector prospects for India and caused the currency to strengthen appreciably, reducing the magnitude of imported inflation. 52. Together, these factors have resulted in an extraordinary downward revision in the Reserve Bank\u2019s 12-month ahead inflation outlook. However, the past two months have also been extraordinarily volatile, making it difficult to make a complete sense of recent data. Let me elaborate. First, it is not easy to ascertain fully at this stage the nature of the collapse of 53. food inflation seen in recent months, particularly in terms of its implications for the food inflation outlook over the medium term. A clearer assessment is particularly clouded by divergence in the direction of price movements in data in key food items provided by the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) and realised food inflation for October. Such divergence in the direction is rarely observed. Further examination of data is necessary to understand with greater clarity the drivers of food deflation. 54. Secondly, market indicators of uncertainty in international crude oil prices remain high, reflecting the unexpectedly large gyrations in their movement this year and upcoming geo-political risks such as OPEC supply decision and trade war uncertainty\u2019s impact on global demand. The implied volatility in crude oil options markets was around 25% per annum (p.a.) in October, which rose to around 45% p.a following the oil price crash. This is a rather high level of uncertainty embedded in expectations of market participants. 55. Thirdly, inflation excluding food and fuel remains persistently high. It is over 6% at present, with only 20-30 basis points attributable to the statistical impact of Centre\u2019s House Rent Allowances (HRA). 56. Fourthly, the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey suggests that input cost pressures are still high for firms and expected to remain elevated (consistent with both closing of the output gap and improvement in capacity utilisation beyond the long period average). This is expected to result in cost pass-through to consumers in the coming months. 57. Fifthly, median household inflation expectations have softened at 3-month horizon by 40 basis points but remain unchanged for 12-month horizon. Over a 12- month period during which the Reserve Bank has raised the policy rate by 50 basis points (bps), median household expectations of inflation for 3-month horizon have risen by 150 bps and for 12-month horizon by 120 bps. 58. Finally, the risk of a fiscal slippage at the center and/or state levels appears to be considered within the realm of reasonable possibility. As such, the sharp decline in oil prices has provided an opportunity for fiscal consolidation. 59. In summary, even though the projections have been revised downwards significantly, several upside risks remain. In my view, it is better to understand data somewhat better over the next two months. Counter-factual exercises suggest that with headline inflation at 12-month horizon above the target (at 4.2% in Q2 of 2019- 20), a change in the stance at this stage, especially with heightened oil price volatility, would be premature. In other words, while the recent downward surprises to inflation have significantly reduced the extent of policy tightening required in future, they have not eliminated the requirement altogether. 60. Turning to growth, the outlook remains overall healthy, though there are some signs of emerging downside risks. On the positive front, investment has picked up and should be buoyed further by improving capacity utilisation. Composite PMI stands at its highest level in 24 months. Coincident and leading indicators, such as aggregate bank credit, are increasing above the nominal GDP growth rate. Oil price and external sector pressures have reduced which should ease financing conditions. On the negative front, there are some segments experiencing slowdown such as auto sales, but at least a part of this appears, in our research, to be linked to fuel price rise of past six months and regulatory revisions in mandatory third-party insurance requirements. The Q2 print for GDP growth was below the Reserve Bank\u2019s expectation but the Q1 print was far above. Overall, due to change in macroeconomic conditions, the two-sided growth surprises have not led to revision in our growth forecast for next 12 months. 61. On balance, given the relatively short period of time over which inflation has softened, it is important to wait and watch, i.e., remain data-dependent as well as reliant on clear understanding of the drivers of recent data. I, therefore, vote for keeping the policy repo rate on hold and maintaining the stance of monetary policy as calibrated tightening. 62. Headline inflation moderated significantly to 3.3 per cent in October from 3.7 per cent in August. Headline inflation adjusted for the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees also softened to 3.1 per cent in October from 3.4 per cent in August 2018. Food inflation continued to surprise on the downside; widening of deflation in pulses, vegetables, and sugar, along with broad-based moderation in other food items moved the food group into deflation. Inflation in fuel remained elevated, reflecting a rise in international prices of liquefied petroleum gas and calibrated increase in domestic administered prices of kerosene. Inflation in items other than food and fuel rose sharply (to more than 6 per cent) on account of transport and communication, health, household goods and services and personal care and effects. On the whole, actual CPI inflation prints, especially in October, turned out to be markedly lower than the projections set out in the October policy. 63. Going forward, inflation is projected at 2.7-3.2 per cent in H2:2018-19 and 3.8- 4.2 per cent in H1:2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside. Adjusted for the HRA impact also, the above projections remain unchanged as the impact will fade away completely in December. Though inflation projections have been revised downwards, several uncertainties continue to cloud the outlook in the form of : (i) the risk of a sudden reversal of the unusually low food prices; (ii) continuing uncertainty about the exact impact of MSP on food inflation; (iii) uncertainty of the oil price trajectory; (iv) volatile financial markets; (v) elevated inflation expectations; (vi) the likely staggered impact of HRA revisions by state governments; the direct statistical impact of HRA will be looked through while being mindful of the second-round effects; and (vii) the risk of fiscal slippages at the centre and/or state levels. With the general government (centre plus states) fiscal deficit budgeted at about 6 per cent of GDP in 2018-19, the extant national fiscal stance continues to be more akin to a \u201cshock amplifier\u201d rather than a \u201cshock absorber\u201d for our macroeconomy. 64. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth decelerated to 7.1 per cent in Q2:2018- 19, after four consecutive quarters of acceleration, driven mainly by a slowdown in private consumption. A sharper growth of imports relative to exports resulted in net exports pulling down aggregate demand. However, gross fixed capital formation expanded by double-digits for the third consecutive quarter. On the supply side, growth in manufacturing decelerated due to lower profitability of manufacturing firms. Low precipitation level during the north-east monsoon \u2013 49 per cent below the long period average \u2013 may have negative impact on activity in the farm sector. However, on the positive side, the decline in crude oil prices could boost India\u2019s growth prospects. Increased capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector also augurs well for investment activity, especially because bank credit growth has continued to accelerate. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth for 2018-19 has been projected at 7.4 per cent (7.2-7.3 per cent in H2) as in the October policy, and for H1:2019-20 at 7.5 per cent, with risks somewhat to the downside. All things considered, the time is apposite to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals; fiscal discipline is critical to create space for and crowd in private investment activity. 65. Although the inflation trajectory has been revised downwards, several uncertainties persist, especially about the medium-term outlook of food inflation and oil prices. Incoming data should help clear the haziness and enable better assessment of the inflation outlook, especially regarding the permanence of the current softness in inflation prints. Hence, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and retaining the stance of monetary policy as \u201ccalibrated tightening\u201d. Should upside risks, as outlined above, not materialise on a durable basis in the coming months, there is possibility of space opening up for policy action in due course. Jose J.

Kattoor Chief General Manager ", "file13": "The fifteenth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from February 5 to 7, 2019 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its  reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 6.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent with immediate effect. The MPC also decided to change the monetary policy stance from calibrated tightening to neutral. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the last MPC meeting in December 2018, there has been a slowdown in global economic activity. Among key advanced economies (AEs), economic activity in the US lost some steam in Q4:2018. The outlook for Q1:2019 is clouded by the partial government shutdown, though the labour market conditions remain strong. In the Euro area, economic activity lost momentum on weak industrial activity. The Japanese economy is gradually recovering and an accommodative monetary policy stance is expected to buttress domestic spending. 7. Economic activity also slowed in some major emerging market economies (EMEs). In China, growth decelerated in Q4:2018. Economic activity in Russia lost pace, with soft oil prices posing a downside risk to growth. The Brazilian economy appeared to have ended 2018 on a firmer note, driven by improved domestic spending and exports, though industrial activity continued to struggle to recover from the disruptions of H1:2018. In South Africa, the economic recovery in Q4:2018 remained gradual, tempered by weak industrial activity and subdued exports. 8. Crude oil prices recovered from their December lows in early January on production cuts, but remain below their peak levels in October. Base metals, which witnessed selling pressures in December on persisting uncertainty over US-China trade frictions, recouped losses in January on expectations of thawing of trade disputes and production disruptions. Gold prices have risen, underpinned by safe haven demand in response to geo-political uncertainty and volatility in equity markets. Inflation edged lower in major AEs and many key EMEs. Global financial markets began the year on a calmer note after a turbulent December. 9. Among AEs, equity markets in the US recovered from a sharp sell-off in December, triggered by monetary policy tightening by the Fed, trade tensions and an impending shutdown. EM stock markets, which declined in December on a slew of soft economic data, registered some gains recently on expectations of accommodative monetary policy stances in major economies. The 10-year yield in the US, which fell to a multi-month low in December, rose in January on the edging up of crude oil prices and positive risk sentiment, though softening of the Fed stance restricted the gains. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area and Japan eased on diminishing optimism about global growth. In most EMEs, bond yields have eased as well. In currency markets, the US dollar remained under pressure, though expectations of easing trade tensions provided some support. EME currencies appreciated on the pause in the rate hiking cycle by the Fed and expectations of a positive outcome from US-China trade negotiations. 10. Moving on to the domestic economy, on January 7, 2019 the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released the first advance estimates (FAE) for 2018-19, placing India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.2 per cent \u2013 the same level as in 2017-18 (first revised estimates). The FAE for 2018-19 featured an acceleration in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and a slowdown in consumption expenditure (both private and government). The drag from net exports is estimated to decline in 2018-19. Some indicators of investment demand, viz., production and imports of capital goods, 11. contracted in November/December. Credit flows to industry remain muted. Available data suggest that while revenue expenditure of the Centre, excluding interest payments and subsidies, contracted in Q3, that of States increased sharply, thus maintaining overall growth in government spending. On the supply side, the FAE have placed the growth of real gross value added (GVA) at 12. 7.0 per cent in 2018-19 as compared with 6.9 per cent in 2017-18. The estimates incorporated a slowdown in agricultural GVA growth and an acceleration in industrial GVA growth. Services GVA growth is set to soften due to subdued activity in trade, hotels, transport, communication and other services. Growth in public administration and defence services is also likely to moderate. Rabi sowing so far (up to February 1, 2019) has been lower than in the previous year, but 13. the overall shortfall of 4.0 per cent across various crops is expected to catch up as the season comes to a close. The lower rabi sowing reflects a deficient north-east monsoon (44 per cent below the long period average); however, storage in major reservoirs \u2013 the main source of irrigation during the rabi season \u2013 at 44 per cent of the full reservoir level (as on January 31, 2019) was marginally higher than in the previous year. The extended period of cold weather in this year\u2019s winter is likely to boost wheat yields, which would partly offset the shortfall, if any, in area sown. After exhibiting an uptick in the festive month of October, industrial activity, measured 14. by the index of industrial production (IIP), slowed down in November. The year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in core industries decelerated to 2.6 per cent (y-o-y) in December, pulled down by a slowdown in the production of electricity and coal; and contraction in petroleum refinery products, crude oil and fertilisers output. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, as measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), increased to 74.8 per cent in Q2 from 73.8 per cent in Q1; seasonally adjusted CU also improved to 75.3 per cent from 74.9 per cent. While the Reserve Bank\u2019s business assessment index of the industrial outlook survey (IOS) for Q3:2018-19 suggests a weakening of demand conditions in the manufacturing sector, the business expectations index (BEI) points to an improvement in Q4. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for January remained in expansion on the back of increased output and new orders. High-frequency indicators of the services sector suggest some moderation in the pace of 15. activity. Sales of motorcycles and tractors imply weakening of rural demand in December. Sales of passenger cars \u2013 an indicator of urban demand \u2013 contracted, possibly reflecting volatility in fuel prices and mandated long-term insurance premium payments. Commercial vehicle sales also shrank in December 2018 from a high base of the previous year. Lead indicators for the hotels sub-segment, viz., foreign tourist arrivals and air passenger traffic, point to softening in November-December. In the communication sub-segment, the telephone subscriber base contracted in October-November, while that of broadband continued to expand in October. The services PMI continued to expand in January 2019 despite a dip from the previous month. Indicators of the construction sector, viz., consumption of steel and production of cement, 16. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, declined from 3.4 per cent in October 2018 to 2.2 per cent in December, the lowest print in the last eighteen months. Continuing deflation in food items, a sharp fall in fuel inflation and some edging down of inflation excluding food and fuel contributed to the decline in headline inflation. Five constituents of the food group \u2013 vegetables, sugar, pulses, eggs and fruits, 17. accounting for about 30 per cent of food group \u2013 were in deflation in December. Inflation in respect of other major food sub-groups \u2013 cereals, milk, and oils and fats \u2013 was subdued. Within cereals, rice prices declined for the fourth consecutive month in December. Inflation in prices of meat and fish and non-alcoholic beverages showed an uptick, while it remained sticky for prepared meals. 18. Inflation in the fuel and light group fell from 8.5 per cent in October to 4.5 per cent in December, pulled down by a sharp decline in the prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), reflecting softening of international petroleum product prices. Kerosene inflation continued to edge up due to the calibrated increase in its administered price. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel decelerated to 5.6 per cent in December from 6.2 19. per cent in October, dragged down mainly by the moderation in the prices of petrol and diesel in line with the decline in international petroleum product prices. Housing inflation continued to edge down as the impact of the house rent allowance (HRA) increase for central government employees dissipated. However, inflation in several of the sub-groups \u2013 household goods and services; health; recreation and amusement; and education \u2013 firmed up in December, offsetting much of the impact of lower inflation in petrol, diesel and housing. Inflation expectations of households, measured by the December 2018 round of the 20. Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, softened by 80 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon and by 130 basis points for the twelve-month ahead horizon over the last round, reflecting the continued decline in food and fuel prices. Producers\u2019 assessment of inflation in input prices eased in Q3 as reported by manufacturing firms polled by the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey. 21. despite some softening. Growth in rural wages moderated in October. Inflation in the prices of farm inputs and industrial raw materials remained elevated, The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate on 12 out of 20 22. days in December, all 23 days in January and 4 days in February (up to February 6). The WACR was below the repo rate on an average by 4 basis points in December and 11 basis points each in January and February. Currency in circulation expanded sharply during December and January. The liquidity needs arising out of expansion in currency were met by the Reserve Bank through injection of durable liquidity amounting to \u20b9500 billion each in December and January through purchases under open market operations (OMOs). Accordingly, total durable liquidity injected through OMOs has aggregated \u20b92.36 trillion during 2018-19 so far. Liquidity injected under the LAF was \u20b9996 billion in December on an average daily net basis, and \u20b9329 billion in January. In February, however, the average daily liquidity position turned into surplus with an average absorption of \u20b9279 billion. 23. Export growth on a y-o-y basis was almost flat in November and December 2018, primarily due to a high base effect and weak global demand. While growth in exports of petroleum products remained positive, non-oil exports declined, dragged down by lower shipments of gems and jewellery, engineering goods, meat and poultry. Import growth slowed in November and turned negative in December 2018. While imports of petroleum (crude and products) rose in line with the increase in import volumes, non-oil imports such as pearls and precious stones, gold, electronic goods and transport equipment, recorded declines. The merchandise trade deficit for April-December 2018 was a shade higher than its level a year ago. Net services exports picked up in October and November 2018, which combined with low oil prices, could have a salutary impact on the current account deficit in Q3. On the financing side, net FDI flows to India during April-November 2018 were higher than a year ago. Foreign portfolio flows turned negative in January 2019, after rebounding in November and December 2018. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 400.2 billion on February 1, 2019. 24. In the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy resolution in December 2018, CPI inflation for 2018-19 was projected in the range of 2.7-3.2 per cent in H2:2018-19 and 3.8-4.2 per cent in H1:2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside. The actual inflation outcome at 2.6 per cent in Q3:2018-19 was marginally lower than the projection. There have been downward revisions in inflation projections during the course of the year, reflecting mainly the unprecedented soft inflation recorded across food sub-groups. 25. Several factors will shape the inflation path, going forward. First, food inflation has continued to surprise on the downside with continuing deflation across several items and a significant moderation in inflation in cereals. Several food groups are experiencing excess supply conditions domestically as well as internationally. Hence, the short-term outlook for food inflation appears particularly benign, despite adverse base effects. Secondly, the moderation in the fuel group was larger than anticipated. Inflation in items of rural consumption such as firewood and chips, which had remained sticky and at elevated levels, has collapsed in recent months. Electricity prices also showed an unexpected moderation, providing a softer outlook for the fuel group. Thirdly, while inflation excluding food and fuel remains elevated, the recent unusual pick-up in the prices of health and education could be a one-off phenomenon. Fourthly, the crude oil price outlook remains broadly the same as in the December policy. Fifthly, the Reserve Bank\u2019s surveys show that inflation expectations of households as well as input and output price expectations of producers have moderated significantly. Finally, the effect of the HRA increase for central government employees has dissipated completely along expected lines. Taking into consideration these developments and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, the path of CPI inflation is revised downwards to 2.8 per cent in Q4:2018-19, 3.2-3.4 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 3.9 per cent in Q3:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced around the central trajectory. 26. Turning to the growth outlook, GDP growth for 2018-19 in the December policy was projected at 7.4 per cent (7.2-7.3 per cent in H2) and at 7.5 per cent for H1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the downside. The CSO has estimated GDP growth at 7.2 per cent for 2018-19. Looking beyond the current year, the growth outlook is likely to be influenced by the following factors. First, aggregate bank credit and overall financial flows to the commercial sector continue to be strong, but are yet to be broad-based. Secondly, in spite of soft crude oil prices and the lagged impact of the recent depreciation of the Indian rupee on net exports, slowing global demand could pose headwinds. In particular, trade tensions and associated uncertainties appear to be moderating global growth. Taking into consideration the above factors, GDP growth for 2019-20 is projected at 7.4 per cent \u2013 in the range of 7.2-7.4 per cent in H1, and 7.5 per cent in Q3 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced. 27. Headline inflation is projected to remain soft in the near term reflecting the current low level of inflation and the benign food inflation outlook. Beyond the near term, some uncertainties warrant careful monitoring. First, vegetable prices have been volatile in the recent period; reversal in vegetable prices could impart upside risk to the food inflation trajectory. Secondly, the oil price outlook continues to be hazy. Thirdly, a further heightening of trade tensions and geo-political uncertainties could also weigh on global growth prospects, dampening global demand and softening global commodity prices, especially oil prices. Fourthly, the unusual spike in the prices of health and education needs to be closely watched. Fifthly, financial markets remain volatile. Sixthly, the monsoon outcome is assumed to be normal; any spatial or temporal variation in rainfall may alter the food inflation outlook. Finally, several proposals in the union budget for 2019-20 are likely to boost aggregate demand by raising disposable incomes, but the full effect of some of the measures is likely to materialise over a period of time. 28. The MPC notes that the output gap has opened up modestly as actual output has inched lower than potential. Investment activity is recovering but supported mainly by public spending on infrastructure. The need is to strengthen private investment activity and buttress private consumption. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to change the stance of monetary policy from 29. calibrated tightening to neutral and to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. 30. The decision to change the monetary policy stance was unanimous. As regards the reduction in the policy repo rate, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision. Dr. Chetan Ghate and Dr. Viral V. Acharya voted to keep the policy rate unchanged. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by February 21, 2019. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from April 2 to 4, 2019. Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Shri Shaktikanta Das 32. In the last several reviews, I have highlighted the need for keeping inflationary expectations anchored durably at the 4% target. While the 3 month and 1 year ahead inflationary expectation numbers still remain elevated, the decline in median inflationary expectations in the most recent round for three months (by 80 basis points) and for 1 year ahead (by 130 basis points) is encouraging. This is the first time since the history of the survey that the change in inflationary expectations has been as large as it has from a \u201clow\u201d level. Going forward, lower oil and food prices \u2013 if sustained \u2013 will help inflationary 33. expectations further taper allowing for the durability of the 4% target. 34. reflecting increases and prospective increases in global supply. Food inflation was in deflation (-1.5%, Y-o-Y) in December. Few commodities (pulses, sugar) continue to have persisting deflation, although pulses deflation has reduced from double digits to a single digit. The existing glut in international markets for various food commodities will limit the scope for food exports keeping a lid on food commodities inflation in the months ahead. Inadequate procurement has also helped limit the pass through from higher MSP prices to headline inflation. Oil prices have declined by more than 30 percent since its peak in early October mainly 35. RBI\u2019s projections for Q3 FY 19-20 headline inflation stand at 3.9%. These projections are however sensitive to the assumed momentum on food inflation. If, for instance, vegetable prices rebound in April-August in a stronger way, these projections will be easily breached. The bouncing back of vegetable prices is not an unreasonable assumption when seen from the perspective of the high weighted contribution of vegetables to food inflation in the last 6 years or so. Also, area under Rabi crops sown so far is lower. Factors like these make it opportune to wait and watch to see how the food price sub-index evolves in the next couple of months. 36. The elevated level of inflation ex food and fuel continues to be challenging, despite the fall from 5.8% in November to 5.6% in December. Offsetting base and momentum effects have kept inflation ex food and fuel sticky. The m-o-m seasonally adjusted annualised rate (saar) for inflation ex food fuel in December 2018 was elevated at 5.4 per cent. Inflation has thus softened but not in a broad-based way. 38. I see the growth picture as robust despite the emergence of soft spots. Economic growth in the last four years (since the advent of inflation targeting) based on CSO\u2019s latest revisions averaged 7.7%, which is consistent with elevated core inflation and a virtually closed output gap. While non-food bank credit (NFBC) growth has declined marginally in the last few months, it continues to be high (14.6% on January 18, 2019). Credit growth to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) was also high at 55.1% in December 2018 according to RBI data. This level has been above 40% since July 2018. Both the service and manufacturing PMIs continue to be in expansion mode for the last several months. Seasonally adjusted capacity utilization rose for the 2nd consecutive quarter in Q2: 18-19 to 75.3%. There was also a significant improvement in consumer sentiment. 39. On the downside, the IIP fell to a 17 month low at 0.5% Y-o-Y, although this reflects the somewhat higher volatility typical of the October-December window because of festive holidays. Consumer durable goods production also contracted by 0.9 per cent in November 2018. Growth in a number of economies has slowed this year due to trade tensions and the associated uncertainty. This clouds India\u2019s export outlook and should be carefully watched. I also worry that India is not consolidating fiscally although the extra budgetary spending 40. on social welfare and stimulative programs may not materialize (unless states match it with their own initiatives). The quality of fiscal expenditures after the election may also improve. 41. sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over the medium-term. Given the above reasons, maintaining status quo on the rates would be consistent with I vote, however, to change the stance to neutral from \u2018calibrated tightening\u2019. Headline inflation softened to 2.2 per cent in December from 2.3 per cent in November 43. and 3.4 per cent in October, primarily due to a drop in food inflation from -0.1 per cent in October to -1.7 per cent in November and -1.5 per cent in December. Inflation excluding food and fuel fell from 6.2 per cent in October to 5.7 per cent and 5.6 per cent in November and December, respectively. The impact of house rent allowance of central government employees has now faded, while there is an unusual spike in inflation in health and education. At the same time, there was also a moderation in inflation in transport and communication. RBI\u2019s projected trajectory of headline inflation has also somewhat softened to 2.8 per 44. cent in Q4 of 2018-19 (down from 3.2 per cent in the last policy round) and 3.4 per cent in Q2 of 2019-20 (down from 4.2 per cent). Furthermore, various surveys signal moderation in inflation expectations. Inflation expectations in the December 2018 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Survey of Households softened by 80 basis points and 130 basis points for three-month ahead and one- year ahead horizons, respectively, vis-\u00e0-vis the last round. The Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey indicates moderation in input prices in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, as reported by manufacturing firms. The Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for January 2019 suggests that input costs and selling prices remain modest. The Economic Cycle Research Institute\u2019s (ECRI) Indian Future Inflation Gauge, a harbinger of inflation, has also declined, signalling a moderation in future inflation. One-year-ahead Business Inflation Expectations also declined in December, as per the Business Inflation Expectations Survey conducted by IIM-Ahmedabad for the month of December. 45. Looking forward, downside risks to the inflation outlook include continuing moderation in food inflation. The slowdown in global growth may also lead to softening of crude oil prices and moderation in inflation. Upside risks include supply disruptions in crude oil and geopolitical tensions. On the output side, although RBI lowered its growth projection, GDP is expected to grow 46. by 7.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019-20, rising to 7.5 percent in Q3. Consumer Confidence has improved in the December 2018 round, with the future expectations index close to the all- time high of the December 2016 round. Forward looking indicators such as RBI\u2019s Business Expectations Index for the manufacturing sector signal an improvement in the fourth quarter based on upbeat sentiments on production, order books, exports and capacity utilisation. These movements are corroborated by the January PMI. Meanwhile, growth in the Indian Leading Index, a predictor of the direction of Indian economic growth maintained by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, has risen lately, indicating some improvement in economic growth prospects. 47. A major downside risk to growth is the continued global growth slowdown, along with trade tensions and associated uncertainties. Indeed, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Exports Index has weakened, dimming the exports growth outlook. According to ECRI\u2019s leading indexes, U.S. economic growth is expected to continue to decelerate, while the inflation cycle is expected to remain in a downswing in the coming months, despite the Fed's abrupt U-turn. Furthermore, based on ECRI\u2019s Chinese leading indexes, overall Chinese growth is expected to continue to languish for the time being, while Chinese industrial growth will stay in a downturn, in the months ahead. Eurozone economic growth prospects remain dismal, with Italy in recession and Germany and France getting closer to recessionary conditions. Thus, as per ECRI\u2019s prognosis, overall global economic growth will continue to stay in a cyclical downswing, while inflation will decline in every major economy. This may not only halt central bank plans for policy \"normalization\", but also afford leeway for policy easing. 48. In light of the benign inflation outlook and a moderation in inflation expectations, as well as the likely headwinds due to the global growth slowdown, I vote for decreasing the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and changing the stance from calibrated tightening to neutral. 49. In the MPC meeting of December 2018, I had argued that given the sudden favourable changes in the macroeconomic environment during November 2018 and their magnitude, it was the most opportune time for the MPC to cut the policy rate. However, because the MPC had insistently changed its stance from neutral to calibrated tightening with a 5:1 majority vote only in the previous meeting of October stating explicitly that any rate cuts were off the table, it would not be appropriate to cut the rate in the December 2018 policy. My strong plea to change the stance to neutral was also not accepted by my other colleagues in the MPC, though it was made clear in the subsequent communication that in future the MPC could consider a rate cut if the upside risk to inflation did not materialize. The subsequent two prints of monthly CPI headline inflation for November and December 2018, which are now available, confirm that the upside risks have considerably subdued with the predicted inflation over the next 3-4 quarters coming down further. On the other hand, there are concerns about the GDP growth slowing down, which is reflected in the marginal reduction in the RBI\u2019s growth forecast. Therefore, it would be appropriate to consider a rate cut not only to correct the past inaction but also provide impetus to growth without materially risking inflation beyond the targeted 4 percent. Under these circumstances, I think space has opened up for a substantial rate cut of about 50 to 60 bps going forward. There is, therefore, an immediate need to change the stance formally from calibrated tightening to neutral and cut the policy rate by 25 bps to begin with. More specific reasons for my vote are as follows: i) The implicit volatility in the oil prices was unusually high during November 2018, but now, during December 2018 and particularly January 2019, has significantly come down to almost its long-term average. There is an expectation of oil prices stabilizing at current ii) Food prices are likely to remain subdued over the next 3-4 quarters as per the detailed exercise of forecast undertaken by the RBI staff in consultation with the subject matter experts. Inflation ex-food and fuel is also predicted to fall from its current level of about 5.9 percent in Q3 of 2018-19 to about 5.1 percent in Q3 of 2019-20. It may fall even more if the current spike in health and education price index turns out to be only one off phenomenon. Thus, the core (or ex-food and fuel) inflation also shows a declining trend. This is quite consistent with the finding of my study with a co-author published in EPW (March 03, 2018) that persistence of core inflation is coming down in India perhaps because the inflation targeting regime in India has resulted in anchoring of people\u2019s inflationary expectations and as a result the core inflation is also declining. iv) As a result of all this, the headline inflation forecast one year ahead by RBI staff has turned out to be less than the target of 4 percent for the first time. With the policy rate of 6.5 percent, this implies the real policy rate of about 2.6 percent, which is one of the highest in the world as I have been arguing. We do not need such a high real policy rate. It only discourages private investment and impedes growth and employment. There is an urgent need to correct the situation by bringing down the real policy rate to a more reasonable and acceptable level particularly when the expected inflation 3-4 quarters ahead is within the target of 4 percent. It is important to note that the inflationary expectations in the economy have also been falling now at least for the last three survey rounds. Median household inflationary expectations 3 and 12 months ahead in the RBI surveys have shown considerable decline of about 120 and 130 bps and business expectations of headline CPI inflation 12 months ahead in the IIMA surveys have shown 53 bps decline. Moreover, the absolute number in the latter is 3.8 percent, which is almost the same as the RBI forecast. This provides more comfort for our quantitative assessment going forward. vi) Recently announced budget of the Central Government shows no fiscal slippage from the path of fiscal and debt consolidation during 2018-19 when we consider the first revised estimates of GDP published on 31st January 2019. The slippage during 2019-20 without additional resource mobilization (since it was an interim budget) also turns out to be less than 20 bps from the fiscal consolidation path. In all probability, in the regular budget to be presented after the general election, such a minor gap may be covered with additional resource mobilization. It may not, therefore, have any significant inflationary impact on the economy and a very limited impact on the real interest rates in the system. With the institutional reforms in the recent past, significant fiscal slippage from the states side taking place is also not very likely. vii) With the latest revisions in the GDP and unemployment estimates over the recent past there is a need to have a serious relook at the estimates of potential output and potential output growth in the economy. My views expressed earlier on the issue and estimates given by renowned scholars with rich policy making experience in the country need to be considered seriously. Accordingly, the potential output growth for the Indian economy going forward seems to be in the range of 8 to 8.5 percent and not 7 to 7.5 percent as was implicitly assumed now for quite some time. If we consider this more plausible estimate, the output gap is widening rather than closing. Generally, as the economic policy reforms are implemented, the potential output growth rises because it opens up new opportunities viii) The experience of this MPC corroborates a negative correlation between the real policy rate (as measured by the excess of the actual policy rate over the projected inflation one year ahead at the time of the policy announcement) and the real GDP growth. One cannot reject the hypothesis that the recent slowdown in the real GDP growth in India is on account of high real policy rates among other factors. If so, now is the ripe time to correct the real interest rates and create policy space for future actions if required. 50. Given all these reasons, in my view this is the time to act decisively by changing the stance from calibrated tightening to neutral and cutting the policy rate by 25 bps to begin with. The future rate actions may be data driven particularly with respect to the target of 4 percent headline inflation sustaining over time and the direction and magnitude of output gap. 51. My sense from recent readings is that inflation is troughing and its path over the 12- months ahead horizon is likely to be one that rises from current lows. 52. Given that inflation excluding food and fuel is elevated but sticky (fuel inflation is easing and its weight in the CPI is small relatively speaking), the future trajectory of headline inflation will be determined essentially by the momentum of food price changes, especially in the first half of 2019-20 when typically, there is a pre-monsoon firming up. 53. The critical judgment call is: will the momentum of food prices revert to the typical pattern from the unusually subdued pace observed in 2018-19 (April-August), or, will it take some time for large excess supplies in several food items to balance out before the usual momentum takes hold? My sense is the latter, given that the prices of some items like pulses and sugar are sluggishly emerging out of a deep cyclical downswing, while those of oils and fats are muted by the turning down of international commodity prices, and other prices such as those of fruits, vegetables and milk are experiencing irregular and unusual softness. The outlook for cereal prices has also turned benign, with prospects of drawing down of sizable excess buffer stocks in the months ahead. 54. Meanwhile, outside the food group, upside risks to the headline inflation path from crude prices have also ebbed considerably and the recent upsurges in prices of education and health could possibly be short-lived. 55. In an inflation targeting framework, the forecast becomes the intermediate target because it congeals all available information on the final goal variables \u2013 inflation and growth \u2013 which are invisible. The forecast indicates that headline inflation is likely to course below 4 per cent up to the third quarter of 2019-20, thus securing the target over a one-year ahead time horizon. Significantly, the path of inflation has been adjusted downwards by 40-80 basis points since the last meeting of the MPC in December 2018. This is consistent with the stylised evidence \u2013 surveyed households, businesses and professional forecasters have made sizable corrections in their inflation expectations over the next twelve months; consumers are more sanguine about the evolving price situation than before; and cost pressures are moderate with delayed and incomplete pass-through to selling prices. The key insight is provided by the direction of these adjustments, not their levels. 11 As the amended RBI Act enjoins us, if the primary target for headline inflation is 56. achieved on a reasonably lasting basis, it opens up some headroom to address the objective of growth. The MPC will need to closely monitor the evolution of these disparately driven price movements and calibrate the monetary policy stance accordingly. If the momentum of food price changes in the next few months indicates that inflation is likely to rise above 4 per cent and persist in the upper reaches of the tolerance band, pre-emptive action will be warranted to ensure that the primary objective of maintaining price stability is defended and achieved lastingly. 57. Turning to the outlook for growth, domestic activity remains resilient, but it appears to be shedding some speed in the second half of 2018-19. Dark clouds seem to be gathering over the horizon. High frequency indicators suggest that the pick-up in investment in the first half of 2018-19 may have lost some strength in the second half and considerable uncertainty shrouds the prospects of an improvement in private investment \u2013 especially into new capacity addition \u2013 and capacity utilisation in manufacturing is straining above trend in view of the still weak capex cycle. 58. The biggest downside risk to growth is likely to stem from global developments \u2013 the weakening of global growth in the second half of 2018 may prolong into coming quarters; global trade and investment may be impacted by ongoing trade tensions; and tail risks from policy uncertainties in systemically important economies may crystallise. Should a deeper than currently anticipated global slowdown take hold, domestic activity could be dragged down by retarding impulses transmitted through the channels of exports and investment. In this scenario, it is prudent to preserve sufficient policy space to insulate the economy from adverse external shocks and boost the domestic economy in an opportune manner rather than deplete it in haste. Accordingly, I vote for a 25 basis points reduction in the policy rate and a pre-emptive 59. shift to a neutral policy stance. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya Since the December monetary policy meeting, food inflation prints have continued to be 60. soft, mainly due to vegetables and fruits witnessing healthy domestic production combined with imports (in some cases). In fact, several food groups are now in deflation, continuing with the momentum of recent food inflation prints that were available at the time of the December policy. Fuel inflation has eased due to a drop in international Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) prices. Headline inflation excluding food and fuel has moderated somewhat due to a fall in crude oil prices and complete waning of central government employees\u2019 House Rent Allowance (HRA) effects; nevertheless, it remains at a highly elevated level, ranging between 5.6-6.2% over the past three prints, with inflation in health and education components showing a spike in December due to unexpected rise in prices of medicines and private tuition costs. The RBI headline inflation projections were already revised substantially downward from 61. October to December by between 40-80 basis points (bps) for different quarters over a 12-month projection horizon. The additional downside surprise relative to December projections has been small, around 10 bps on a quarterly basis. Inflation expectations of households as measured by RBI\u2019s survey (IEH) reveal a softening by 80 bps at 3-month horizon and 130 bps at 12-month horizon, possibly reflecting the adaptive nature of household expectations in response to the softness of recent inflation prints; importantly, they too indirectly confirm the ground reality and revision in inflation perceptions, especially in food and fuel categories. 63. My understanding of composition effects and risks around these projections is as follows: 64. One, inflation excluding food and fuel remains elevated and persistent, so it seems crucial to understand if the sharp increase in momentum observed in health and education components is one-off or not. While it seems reasonable to treat it as one-off for now, if it does sustain then it could push inflation excluding food and fuel into uncomfortable territory. Unfortunately, there is no decisive way to resolve this issue other than to wait for and analyse a few more prints. Second, international Brent crude prices have stabilised in the short run. Nevertheless, it 65. is too early to forget or rule out the wild gyrations from geopolitical risks, as were observed over the past six months. Given our oil imports and the implied current account deficit effects, headline inflation responds particularly adversely to upside risk from crude oil prices. 66. Third, the recent low momentum in food prices is assumed to have a structural component over the next 12-month horizon as there appears to be a supply glut in several food items at both domestic and international levels. Vegetable prices, however, are vulnerable to sudden reversal from their deflationary momentum. 67. More importantly, the assumption of sustained low momentum in food prices leads to a consideration of the risk of agrarian distress. Such distress will necessitate a political-economy response in the form of fiscal support to the agrarian economy in the short run; effects of such fiscal support may play out partly over the next 12 months and partly beyond. Besides stimulating rural demand and restoring rural wages, such a response could get generalised into headline inflation; this could arise, for example, by aggravating the input cost push arising in the financing of the real economy from fiscal and quasi-fiscal financing, especially from national small savings fund (NSSF) into bank deposit rates and from fiscal/quasi-fiscal market borrowings into corporate bond yields. Our counterfactual exercises suggest that such upward pressure on headline inflation would require commensurate policy rate action over the next 12 months. 68. In other words, the assumption of particularly benign food inflation in the short run imparts significant upside risk to the inflation trajectory, at the short- and/or medium-term horizons, from the fiscal adjustments that would be necessary to address resulting agrarian distress and to boost rural demand. 69. Fourth, while inflation expectations have moved downward in the most recent survey, when compared to the December 2017 survey, they remain higher at 3-month horizon. In other words, anchoring of inflation expectations of households is still an ongoing process and it is somewhat early to assume its sustenance going forward based on the most recent adjustment. On balance, I remain concerned about (i) the elevated level of inflation excluding food 70. and fuel; (ii) upward risks that could emanate from oil prices and fiscal implications of sustained food deflation; and, (iii) lack of adequate and sustained downward adjustment in household inflation expectations over the past 12 months. 71. Turning to growth, concerns around global growth, especially in major advanced economies and emerging markets embroiled in tariff wars, have gathered momentum. In response, several central banks have decided to be patient with their rate hike plans and/or have revised growth projections downwards. My assessment is that unless these concerns turn into recessionary risks, they could in fact be positive for the Indian economy as a reduction in aggregate global demand keeps Brent crude oil prices under check. 13 Domestic indicators for economic activity are overall mixed. Overall corporate 72. performance in Q3 of 2018-19 was stable; capacity utilisation \u2013 absolute or seasonally-adjusted \u2013 has remained robust and close to or above 75 for past two quarters; PMI manufacturing and services continue to remain in expansion mode at healthy levels; and consumer sentiment surveyed by the RBI has improved. The primary weak coincident economic indicators have been auto sales and production. Our internal research suggests that this weakness reflects in part the lagged impact of high fuel prices during Q2 and part of Q3 of 2018-19, an effect that should gradually reverse, as well as due to one-off policy changes such as in emission standards and third-party insurance requirement. 73. Traditional measures of the output gap suggest some opening up, i.e., realised output below the potential output; however, my preferred measure, the finance-neutral output gap, remains positive, i.e., realised output is slightly above the potential output, as it captures the healthy aggregate credit growth and stable stock market performance. This is also consistent with the elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel. 74. Combining my inflation and growth assessments, and given the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\u2019s mandate to target headline inflation at 4% on a durable basis while paying attention to growth, I prefer to \u201ctake off the helmet\u201d but \u201cstay within the crease\u201d. That is, I vote for a change in the stance from \u201ccalibrated tightening\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d to retain policy flexibility at future dates based on incoming data, but to hold the policy rate at 6.5%. Given the elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel, our counterfactual exercises do not suggest any room for accommodation; keeping the policy rate at 6.5% under these exercises turns out to be \u201cjust right\u201d over the medium term. 75. In my view, a rate cut decision now would be heavily dependent on the assumption of sustained weak momentum of food prices all through the next 12 months, which, as I explained, must be viewed as coincident with significant upside risk from fiscal measures needed to address agrarian distress. It seems better to me, in times of presently healthy levels of growth, to wait till the next policy by when uncertainties I have highlighted, especially around one-off surprises in health and education inflation, oil prices, and global recessionary risks, could resolve. The growth print for Q3 would also be available by then for understanding any soft spots in the domestic real economy and their drivers. Finally, recall that I did vote for a rate cut in August 2017; at that point of time, all 76. components of inflation had experienced downward trends, upside risks to inflation had reduced, and growth was weaker. That constellation of parameters gave me greater comfort to cut the policy rate than at the present juncture. Should a similar situation evolve in the next two months, I would have greater clarity for future policy action. 77. The CPI inflation print of December at 2.2 per cent continued to surprise on the downside. The overall food group continued to remain in deflation with the decline in food prices becoming more broad-based. Five constituents of the food group \u2013 vegetables, sugar, pulses, eggs and fruits \u2013 were in deflation in December. Fuel inflation also decelerated significantly mainly due to a sharp decline in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Inflation excluding food and fuel also moderated, dragged down mainly by the decline in the prices of petrol and diesel in line with the decline in international petroleum product prices. Housing inflation continued to edge down. However, inflation in household goods and services; health; recreation and amusement; and education firmed up in December 2018. 14 Going forward, the outlook for food inflation is expected to be benign in the backdrop of 78. excess domestic supply conditions in many food items. The lower prices in the international markets in food items also limit the avenues for exports to address the domestic surplus. This will be an important factor in keeping the overall inflation low. Soft crude oil prices augur well for keeping the petroleum product inflation under check and this will help in containing the input costs for goods and services. Inflation expectations of households have declined significantly in the last round, which is a welcome development. CPI inflation is projected at below four per cent in the remaining four quarters \u2013 2.8 per cent in Q4:2018-19, 3.2-3.4 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 3.9 per cent in Q3:2019-20 \u2013 with risks broadly balanced. Beyond the near-term, however, there is a need to guard against some uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook such as (i) abrupt reversal in vegetable prices; (ii) haziness in the oil price outlook; (iii) the recent unusual spike in the prices of health and education, which calls for vigilance; and (iv) the impact of several budget proposals on the aggregate demand, though the full effect of the measures will materialise over a period of time. Turning to the growth outlook, the CSO has placed India\u2019s real GDP growth at 7.2 per 79. cent in 2018-19. Looking further ahead, there are signs of domestic growth slowing down somewhat, compared to the Reserve Bank\u2019s earlier projections. The more recent high frequency indicators point to investment demand losing some traction, with production of capital goods and import of capital goods contracting in recent months. High frequency indicators also suggest moderation in demand (passenger cars, consumer durables, motorcycles and tractor sales). On the supply side, rabi sowing so far has been marginally lower than the previous year, 80. with shortfall across crops. There is, however, an expectation that the acreage will increase in the remaining part of the sowing season. Extended winter conditions are also likely to have a positive impact on overall wheat productivity. High-frequency and survey-based indicators for the manufacturing and services sectors suggest some slowdown in the pace of activity. In the services sector, growth of foreign tourist arrivals and international air passenger traffic decelerated in recent months. However, indicators of the construction sector such as consumption of steel and production of cement continued to show healthy growth, though growth in cement production was lower in November 2018. 81. Overall financing conditions have been improving, with bank credit growth in double digits and the total flow of resources to the commercial sector significantly higher than a year ago. Credit flows to services (such as non-banking financial companies, transport operators and trade) and in the personal loans category, especially housing, have been robust. However, credit growth has yet to become broad-based. Credit flows to industry, in particular, have been anaemic; credit to micro and small industry contracted in December 2018, while credit to large industry expanded at a moderate pace. 82. Global growth is also losing traction amidst lingering trade tensions and uncertainty around Brexit. On the positive side, crude oil prices remain soft, though the benefit for net exports could be restricted due to slowing global demand. GDP growth for 2019-20 is projected at 7.4 per cent \u2013 in the range of 7.2-7.4 per cent in H1, and 7.5 per cent in Q3 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced. Growth impulses have weakened and there is a need to spur private investment and 83. strengthen private consumption, especially in the wake of slowing global growth. Inflation readings since the December 2018 policy have shown a sharp decline. The overall food outlook remains benign and the headline inflation one-year ahead is projected to remain below the target level of 4 per cent. Risks to inflation at this stage are also broadly balanced around the baseline. Hence, space has opened up for policy action to address the growth concerns in pursuance of the provisions of the RBI Act as amended in 2016. The favourable macroeconomic configuration that is evolving underscores the need to act decisively. The time is opportune to seize the initiative and create a congenial environment for growth to revive and ensure a sustained trajectory. Hence, I vote for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. I also vote for a change in the stance of monetary policy from calibrated tightening to neutral. This change in the stance has been largely factored in by market participants after the December MPC meeting and the post policy press conference. The neutral stance will provide flexibility and the room to address challenges to sustained growth of the Indian economy over the coming months, as long as the inflation outlook remains benign.

Marg, Mumbai-400001 \u092b\u094b\u0928/Phone: 022-22610835 \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938/Fax: 91 222266 0358 The thirteenth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from October 3-5, 2018 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members - Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy - and was chaired by Dr. Urjit R. Patel, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.5 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the stance of calibrated tightening of 6. monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 7. Since the last MPC meeting in August 2018, global economic activity has remained resilient in spite of ongoing trade tensions, but is becoming uneven and the outlook is clouded by several uncertainties. Among advanced economies (AEs), the United States (US) economy appeared to have sustained pace in Q3:2018 as reflected in strong retail sales and robust industrial activity. In the Euro area, economic activity remained subdued due to overall weak economic sentiment, weighed down mainly by political uncertainty. The Japanese economy has so far maintained the momentum of the previous quarter, buoyed by recovering industrial production and strong business optimism. 8. Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) has been facing headwinds from both global and country-specific factors. In China, industrial production growth has moderated with slowing exports and the ongoing deleveraging of the financial system weighing on growth prospects. The Russian economy has been gathering steam with the manufacturing sector turning around, and the employment scenario remaining upbeat on rising oil prices. In Brazil, economic activity is recovering from the setback in Q2, supported by improving business and consumer sentiment, though weak domestic demand and the sluggish pace of recovery in manufacturing activity point to a slow revival. The South African economy slipped into recession in Q2:2018, pulled down by the negative contribution from agriculture on account of a strong unfavourable base effect. 9. Growth in global trade is weakening as reflected in export orders and automobile production and sales. Crude oil prices eased during the first half of August on concerns of reduced demand from EMEs due mainly to the spillover from country-specific turmoil, and accentuated by rising supplies. However, prices rebounded on expectation of reduced supplies due to sanctions on Iran and falling US stockpiles. Base metal prices witnessed selling pressure in anticipation of weak demand from major economies. Gold prices continued to slide lower on a strong US dollar, though they recovered somewhat on safe-haven demand from the mid-August lows. Inflation remained firm in the US, reflecting tightening labour market and elevated energy prices, while it persisted much below the central bank\u2019s target in Japan. In the Euro area, inflation pressures have been sustained by elevated crude prices. Inflation in many key EMEs has risen on surging crude prices and currency depreciations, caused by a firm dollar and domestic factors. Global financial markets continued to be affected by monetary policy stances in major 10. AEs, the spreading of contagion risks from specific EMEs, and geopolitical developments. Among AEs, equity markets in the US touched a new high, driven by technology stocks, while in Japan, they were boosted by the weak yen. In contrast, stock markets in the Euro area suffered losses on signs of a slowdown and budget concerns in some member states. Sharp sell-offs have occurred on waning appetite of foreign portfolio investors for EME equities. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US has traded sideways, falling on dovish Fed guidance only to recover by end-September on robust economic data. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area hardened in September on risk aversion following the sharp rise in financial market volatility in August. In contrast, bond yields in Japan moved in a narrow range, driven by the central bank\u2019s yield curve management policy. In most EMEs, yields rose due to domestic factors and/or contagion effects from the stress in other EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar witnessed selling pressures since August on reduced investor expectations of rate hikes by the US Fed. However, it recovered in the last week of September on a rate hike by the Fed and strong economic data. The euro remained in bearish territory due to fiscal risks in some member countries and expectations of weak growth. EME currencies continued to depreciate against the US dollar. On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth surged to a nine- 11. quarter high of 8.2 per cent in Q1:2018-19, extending the sequential acceleration to four successive quarters. Of the constituents, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by double digits for the second consecutive quarter, driven by the government\u2019s focus on the road sector and affordable housing. Growth in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) accelerated to 8.6 per cent, reflecting rising rural and urban spending, supported by retail credit growth. However, government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) decelerated, largely due to a high base. The growth of exports of goods and services jumped to 12.7 per cent, powered by non-oil exports on the back of strong global demand. In spite of import growth continuing to surge, high exports growth helped reduce the drag from net exports on aggregate demand. On the supply side, growth of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices accelerated in Q1, 12. underpinned by double-digit expansion in manufacturing activity which was robust and generalised across firm sizes. Agricultural growth also picked up, supported by robust growth in production of rice, pulses and coarse cereals alongside a sustained expansion in livestock products, forestry and fisheries. In contrast, services sector growth moderated somewhat, largely on account of a high base. Construction activity, however, maintained strong pace for the second consecutive quarter. The fourth advance estimates of agricultural production for 2017-18 released in August 13. placed foodgrains production at a high of 284.8 million tonnes, 1.9 per cent higher than the third advance estimates (released in May 2018) and 3.5 per cent higher than the final estimates for the previous year. The progress of the south-west monsoon has been marked by uneven spatial and temporal distribution, with an overall deficit of 9 per cent in precipitation. However, the first advance estimates of production of major kharif crops for 2018-19 have placed foodgrains production at 141.6 million tonnes, 0.6 per cent higher than last year\u2019s level. The live storage in major reservoirs (as on September 27) rose to 76 per cent of the full capacity, which was 17 per cent higher than last year and 5 per cent higher than the average of the last 10 years. This bodes well for the rabi sowing season. Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), accelerated in 14. June-July 2018 on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, underpinned mainly by high growth in consumer durables, notably two-wheelers, readymade garments, stainless steel utensils, auto components and spares, and accessories. Growth in consumer non-durables also accelerated in July. The infrastructure and construction sector continued to show solid growth. Primary goods growth accelerated, driven by mining, electricity and petroleum refinery products. Growth in capital goods production spiked in June, but decelerated sharply in July. The output of eight core industries growth remained strong in July, driven by coal, petroleum refinery products, steel and cement, but moderated in August. Capacity utilisation (CU) declined from 75.2 per cent in Q4:2017-18 to 73.8 per cent in Q1:2018-19, while seasonally adjusted CU increased by 1.8 percentage points to the long-term average of 74.9 per cent. Based on the Reserve Bank\u2019s business expectations index (BEI), the assessment for Q2:2018-19 improved, led by enhanced production, order books, exports and capacity utilisation. The August and September manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) remained in expansion zone; the September print rebounded close to the July level confirming robustness of manufacturing activity. 15. High-frequency indicators of services in July and August present a mixed picture. Indicators of rural demand, viz., growth in tractor and two-wheeler sales, slowed down. Passenger vehicle sales, an indicator of urban demand, declined possibly due to rising fuel prices. However, growth in air passenger traffic \u2013 another indicator of urban demand \u2013 remained robust. Transportation sector indicators, viz., commercial vehicle sales and port cargo, expanded at an accelerated pace. Steel consumption and cement production, indicators of construction activity, showed strong growth. The services PMI remained in expansion zone in August and September, though it decelerated from July, with slower expansion in new business and employment. Retail inflation, measured by the y-o-y change in the CPI, fell from 4.9 per cent in June to 16. 3.7 per cent in August, dragged down by a decline in food inflation. Some softening of inflation in items other than food and fuel also contributed to the decline. Adjusting for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, headline inflation was at 3.4 per cent. 17. Inflation in the food and beverages group declined sharply in the absence of seasonal uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables. Of the three key vegetables, the prices of tomatoes declined due to strong mandi arrivals, while those of onions and potatoes remained muted. Continued deflation in prices of pulses and sugar accentuated the decline in food inflation. Inflation in other items of food \u2013 cereals, meat and fish, milk, spices and non-alcoholic beverages \u2013 remained benign. 18. Inflation in the fuel and light group continued to rise on the back of a significant increase in liquefied petroleum gas prices, tracking international product prices. Kerosene prices rose as oil marketing companies reduced subsidies in a calibrated manner. While remaining elevated, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated due to softening in inflation in housing; pan, tobacco and intoxicants; personal care; and transportation. 19. While the September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of households reported a sharp uptick of 50 basis points in three-month ahead inflation expectations over the last round, one- year ahead expectations moderated by 30 basis points. Inflation expectations for both input prices and selling prices of manufacturing firms, polled by the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, firmed up in Q2:2018-19. The manufacturing and services PMIs also reported an increase in input costs and selling prices in Q2, reflecting a pass-through of higher costs to clients. On the other hand, growth in wages in the rural and organised manufacturing sectors remained contained. 20. Systemic liquidity alternated between surplus and deficit during August-September 2018, reflecting the combined impact of expansion of currency in circulation, Reserve Bank\u2019s forex operations and movements in government cash balances. From a daily net average surplus of \u20b9 201 billion during August 1-19, 2018, liquidity moved into deficit during August 20-30. After turning into surplus during August 31-September 10 due to increased government spending, the system again moved into deficit during September 11-29 on the back of an increase in government cash balances and Reserve Bank\u2019s forex interventions. Based on an assessment of the evolving liquidity conditions, the Reserve Bank conducted two open market purchase operations in the second half of September to inject \u20b9200 billion of durable liquidity. LAF operations absorbed, on a daily net average basis, \u20b930 billion in August, but injected \u20b9406 billion 4 Exports maintained double digit growth in July and August 2018, driven mainly by 21. petroleum products (which benefitted from elevated crude oil prices), engineering goods, gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. However, imports grew faster than exports, reflecting not only a higher oil import bill, but also higher imports of gold, coal, electronic goods and machinery. This led to a widening of the trade deficit to US$ 35.3 billion in July-August 2018 from US$ 24.6 billion a year ago over and above the expansion in Q1:2018- 19. However, higher net services receipts and private transfer receipts helped contain the current account deficit to 2.4 per cent of GDP in Q1:2018-19 from 2.5 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows improved in April-July 2018. By contrast, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in both the equity and debt segments so far on a cumulative basis in 2018-19 due to higher US interest rates, risk-off sentiment in EMEs and escalation of trade wars. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 400.5 billion on September 28, 2018. In the third bi-monthly resolution of August 2018, CPI inflation was projected at 4.6 per 22. cent in Q2:2018-19, 4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced. Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation was projected at 4.4 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 4.7-4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20. Actual inflation outcomes, especially in August, were below projections as the expected seasonal increase in food prices did not materialise and inflation excluding food and fuel moderated. 23. Going forward, the inflation outlook is expected to be influenced by several factors. First, food inflation has remained unusually benign, which imparts a downward bias to its trajectory in the second half of the year. Inflation in key food items such as pulses, edible oils, sugar, fruits and vegetables remains exceptionally soft at this juncture. The risk to food inflation from spatially and temporally uneven rainfall is also mitigated, as confirmed by the first advance estimates that have placed production of major kharif crops for 2018-19 higher than last year\u2019s record. An estimate of the impact of an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced in July has been factored in the baseline projections. Secondly, the price of the Indian basket of crude oil has increased sharply, by US$ 13 a barrel, since the last resolution. Thirdly, international financial markets remained volatile with EME currencies depreciating significantly. Finally, the HRA effect came off its peak in June and is dissipating gradually on expected lines. Taking all these factors into consideration, inflation is projected at 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.9-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 3.7 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.8 - 4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20. Turning to the growth outlook, the GDP print of Q1:2018-19 was significantly higher 24. than that projected in the August resolution. Private consumption has remained robust and is likely to be sustained even as the recent rise in oil prices may have a bearing on disposable incomes. Improving capacity utilisation, larger FDI inflows and increased financial resources to the corporate sector augur well for investment activity. However, both global and domestic financial conditions have tightened, which may dampen investment activity. Rising crude oil prices and other input costs may also drag down investment activity by denting profit margins of corporates. This adverse impact will be alleviated to the extent corporates are able to pass on increases in their input costs. Uncertainty surrounds the outlook for exports. Tailwinds from the recent depreciation of the rupee could be muted by the slowing down of global trade and the escalating tariff war. Based on an overall assessment, GDP growth projection for 2018-19 is retained at 7.4 per cent as in the August resolution (7.4 per cent in Q2 and 7.1-7.3 per cent in H2), with risks broadly balanced; the path in the August resolution was 7.5 per cent in Q2:2018- 19 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2. GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 is now projected marginally lower at 7.4 per cent as against 7.5 per cent in the August resolution, mainly due to the strong base effect (Chart 2). 25. While the projections of inflation for 2018-19 and Q1:2019-20 have been revised downwards from the August resolution, its trajectory is projected to rise above the August 2018 print. The outlook is clouded with several uncertainties. First, the government announced in September measures aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to farmers for their produce, although uncertainty continues about their exact impact on food prices. Secondly, oil prices remain vulnerable to further upside pressures, especially if the response of oil-producing nations to supply disruptions from geopolitical tensions is not adequate. The recent excise duty cuts on petrol and diesel will moderate retail inflation. Thirdly, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Fourthly, a sharp rise in input costs, combined with rising pricing power, poses the risk of higher pass-through to retail prices for both goods and services. Firms covered under the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey report firming of input costs in Q2:2018-19 and Q3. However, global commodity prices other than oil have moderated, which should mitigate the adverse influence on input costs. Fifthly, should there be fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it will have a bearing on the inflation outlook, besides heightening market volatility and crowding out private sector investment. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by the state governments may push up headline inflation. While the MPC will look through the statistical impact of HRA revisions, there is need to be watchful for any second-round effects on inflation. The inflation outlook calls for a close vigil over the next few months, especially because the output gap has virtually closed and several upside risks persist. 26. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. 27. The MPC notes that global headwinds in the form of escalating trade tensions, volatile and rising oil prices, and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial risks to the growth and inflation outlook. It is, therefore, imperative to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. 28. Regarding the policy repo rate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. Dr. Chetan Ghate voted for an increase in the policy rate by 25 bps. 29. Regarding the stance, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Dr. Urjit R. Patel voted in favour of changing the stance to calibrated tightening. Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to keep the neutral stance unchanged. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by October 19, 2018. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from December 3 to 5, 2018. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Dr. Urjit R. Patel Anchoring inflationary expectations, which are shaped by the target, is extremely 31. important in an inflation targeting regime. If there is substantial deviation of inflationary expectations in relation to the target, by failing to react with the policy interest rate, we will lose credibility and reduce our capacity to influence expectations. 32. While I am comforted by the decline in median inflationary expectations of households for the 1-year ahead horizon by 30 bps in the last RBI\u2019s survey, the median 1-year ahead expectations are now higher by 180 basis points over the September 2017 round. Meanwhile, the three-month median inflationary expectations increased by 50 bps compared to the previous round, with a cumulative increase of about 220 basis points over the September 2017 round. 33. What makes these cumulative increases in inflationary expectations salient, is that they risk being unanchored by both the 7% nominal depreciation in the INR and the USD 13 a barrel increase in the price of oil, since the August 2018 policy. Another factor is the nature and scope of MSP implementation, details of which are still not clear. My own projections with the above variables suggest that these factors will push inflation beyond the Q1 FY19-20 projection of 4.8% made by the RBI. Doing so risks the possibility of the un-anchoring of inflationary expectations which will impair our ability to keep headline inflation durably at 4%. 34. There has been a slight moderation in CPI inflation, excluding food and fuel to 6.0% in August, from 6.2% in July, which is comforting. The elevated value of ex food and fuel inflation is consistent with a nearly-closed output gap which should be carefully watched. 35. On the growth front, the Q1 of 18-19 GDP growth at 8.2% was strong. GVA growth was also strong at 8% (compared to 7.6% in Q4 17-18). Sectoral growth patterns in agriculture, manufacturing, and services in Q1 of 18-19 numbers were robust. Capex good production remains resilient, and the growth in consumer non-durables, which was lack-luster before, has picked up. 36. These numbers are confirmed by RBI\u2019s own surveys. Demand conditions in the manufacturing sector continued to improve with the latest round of the RBI industrial outlook survey (of 1095 manufacturing companies) showing strong sentiments on production and order books. The RBI\u2019s enterprise survey, OBICUS, based on a survey of 994 companies, showed a seasonally adjusted increase in capacity utilization at a 20-quarter high. Firms expect demand conditions to improve in Q3 FY 18-19 on the back of improved business expectations. Higher inventories indicate that producers are stocking up in anticipation of higher demand in coming quarters. Upward pressure on input and staff costs continue to push up selling prices, posing a risk to headline inflation. The most recent PMI manufacturing corroborates this, showing an uptick in input prices and output prices, although the pass through is lower. 37. What worries me on the pick up in growth is the dismal consumer confidence numbers, with consumer confidence in Q2 FY 18-19 worsening. Ideally, in a growing economy, the durability of growth is better sustained if it is supported by growing consumer confidence. Notwithstanding this, I continue to remain sanguine about current and medium term growth prospects as in the last policy. Despite the two hikes in the policy rate in the last two policies, the data since August 38. risks impairing our ability to keep headline inflation durably at 4%. I say this fully cognizant of the trade-off facing the MPC: moving too quickly and needlessly shortening the growth turnaround or, calibrating the rate hikes too slowly, and risking an over-heating in an economy with a nearly closed output gap. Given the strong possibility of the un-anchoring of inflationary expectations for the reasons given above, the appropriate \u201crisk-management approach\u201d would be to act now. We should not allow the commitment to the 4% target to be flexible. 39. I vote for an increase in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points at today\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. I also vote for a change in the stance from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201ccalibrated tightening\u201d. Statement by Dr. Pami Dua 40. Headline inflation softened to 3.7 per cent in August from 4.2 per cent in July and 4.9 per cent in June, mainly due to the drop in food inflation from 3.1 per cent in June to 1.7 per cent in July and 0.9 per cent in August. Headline inflation adjusted for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) of central government employees (as per RBI\u2019s calculations) also moderated from 4.6 per cent in June to 3.4 per cent in August, while CPI excluding food and fuel and adjusted for the impact of an increase in HRA fell from 5.7 per cent in June to 5.4 per cent in August. At the same time, various surveys provide mixed signals regarding inflation expectations. The September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Survey of Households points towards an increase of 50 basis points in three-month-ahead inflation expectations but a moderation of 30 basis points in one-year-ahead expectations. The July- September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey indicates that manufacturing firms expect higher cost of raw materials, input prices and selling prices. The manufacturing and services PMIs also signal a similar trend. 41. Looking forward, the downside risks to the inflation outlook include benign food inflation. The recent cuts in excise duty on petrol and diesel are expected to moderate retail inflation. However, crude oil prices have escalated and the rupee has weakened considerably, with potential pass-through effects on inflation. Moreover, with EME currencies depreciating against the US dollar, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Additionally, fiscal slippages by the government may have adverse implications for market volatility, and may crowd out private investment and impact the outlook for inflation. The upside risks associated with an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) and the HRA still persist, although the latter has somewhat moderated. Risks due to an increase in state level HRAs and input prices also prevail. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the inflation outlook. 42. On the output side, GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018-19 was strong, with robust growth in private consumption. However, downside risks to investment activity include an increase in input prices and crude oil prices and tightening of global and domestic financial conditions, including the recent developments in the non-banking sector. Despite a depreciating rupee, growth in exports may also be hampered due to geopolitical risks, trade war and slowing global economy. 43. Indeed, growth in the Indian Leading Export Index, a predictor of the direction of exports growth maintained by the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), New York, remains in the doldrums, indicating an unfavourable Indian export growth outlook. This is consistent with weakening growth in ECRI\u2019s 20-country composite Long Leading Index, which still points to a global growth slowdown. However, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Index, a harbinger of future economic activity, has firmed lately, pointing to somewhat improved economic growth prospects. 44. In sum, while inflation has softened, upside risks to inflation remain, along with some downside risks to output growth. The policy repo rate has already been increased in the past two consecutive meetings of the MPC (June and August), each time by 25 basis points. Due to the transmission lags, the effects of these may take time to play out. It is therefore best to pause and wait and watch while maintaining a vigil on inflation. I therefore vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. At the same time, given the upside risks to inflation, I also vote for a change in the stance from neutral to calibrated tightening. In the last meeting of the MPC in August 2018, I had clearly mentioned that, if the RBI\u2019s 45. inflation forecast for July and August substantially exceeded the actual reading, its medium term forecast would also have to be revised downward substantially. As expected, this has happened. The RBI forecast for the headline CPI inflation in July and August 2018 turned out to be significantly higher than the actual readings. Similar deviations had occurred even for the RBI\u2019s May and June 2018 headline inflation forecasts. RBI has, therefore, revised its short to medium term forecast of headline inflation significantly downward even after considering revisions in its baseline scenario of higher oil prices and exchange rate. As I had argued in the last meeting, moreover, the household inflationary expectations 12 months ahead have come down (by 30 bps) as per the latest RBI survey. The growth forecast for the Indian economy considering both the latest upside and downside risks has remained the same (7.4 percent) as during the previous meeting of MPC in August 2018 when the MPC decided by a 5-1 majority vote to hike the policy rate pre-emptively by 25 bps. Therefore, now there is no case for any hike in the policy rate this time. This is the time for a pause to allow the consecutive rate hikes to sink in the system and settle down. I, therefore, vote for status quo on both the policy rate and the neutral stance. More specific reasons for my vote are: i) While there is a considerable depreciation of Indian Rupee against US Dollar recently, the rate of depreciation is substantially lower in terms of trade weighted Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER), because other currencies have also depreciated against US Dollar. It is the depreciation in NEER that affects headline inflation. As a result, its impact on inflation is not likely to be very substantial. ii) While the oil price increase has been substantial, the following two aspects need to be explicitly considered for its impact on the headline inflation: (a) it has a lagged effect on inflation depending on its effective pass-through including revisions in domestic taxes; and (b) productivity improvement or revised Input-Output ratios in the oil using productive activities could off-set to a considerable extent the adverse impact of price rise in oil. iii) The impact of House Rent Allowance (HRA) revisions as per the recommendation of 7th CPC in the central and state public sector enterprises, autonomous bodies, universities and other organizations that provide housing to their employees should ideally be seen through as we have been doing for the central government employees (because it is purely statistical). However, this impact has not been separated due to data problems. Since such households would form a significant proportion of the CSO sample households (almost similar to the one for the central government employees) for estimating housing CPI, there is a considerable overestimation of the effective inflation rate for the headline and more so for the CPI-ex-food and fuel. In short, the effective inflation forecasts for the short to medium term are much less than what RBI considers because of the lack of precise information. There is an urgent need to fix this problem so that right data inputs are considered for policy actions. However, till this statistical problem is fixed, I would not consider marginal upward deviations (of about 20-30 bps) of headline inflation forecast from the targeted 4 percent as a major concern requiring any rate action. iv) The US economy has almost peaked and is only likely to go down from there. Therefore, further rate hikes in US may not be as attractive to global investors as before. As far as the Indian economy is concerned, the real interest rate is significantly higher than 2 per cent even after considering the inflationary expectation of businesses 12 months ahead of about 4.36 percent as per the latest IIM Ahmedabad survey results for August 2018 or the RBI\u2019s own inflation forecast 12 months ahead. There is no justification for increasing it further by a rate hike at this point. v) Finally, the headline inflation forecast 12 months ahead by RBI is on a higher side according to me. This is also because the extent to which RBI has considered the impact of MSP revision on inflation is unrealistically high in my opinion. 46. point is the best option. Considering all these points, status quo in both the neutral stance and policy rate at this 47. In its third bi-monthly resolution of August, the MPC had expected inflation to ease in the second quarter of 2018-19 and had brought down its forecast for that quarter by 30 basis points relative to the projection in June. In my minutes in August, I anticipated the soft inflation readings that came in for July and August: \u201cThe forecast \u2013 the intermediate target that provides a proximate view of how the goal variables are forming \u2013 suggests that inflation is likely to encounter a soft patch in the second quarter, but it will resume an upward trajectory in the second 10 half of the year.\u201d I also warned that \u201cthe softer inflation prints expected in Q2 could likely lull inflation expectations, but abundant precaution and decisiveness in quelling risks to the target is warranted if the hard-earned gains in terms of macroeconomic stability and credibility have to be preserved.\u201d 48. the levels of inflation in these months. Thus, the projections turned out to be directionally correct, although they overestimated In view of the reasonable reliability of the forecasts in terms of direction, inflation 49. appears to have troughed and is projected to rise from September, exceeding the target from the fourth quarter of 2018-19 and the first quarter of 2019-20 in an environment suffused with upside risks. Disconcertingly, global risks to inflation from crude prices and financial market turbulence are materialising on an ongoing basis. Corporate finances suggest that it is only a matter of time before firms pass through heightened input costs more aggressively into selling prices. Food inflation is imparting a downside under the influence of a deep cyclical downswing in the prices of some constituents and irregular downturns in others. 50. Meanwhile, aggregate domestic demand, as measured by GDP growth, appears to have quickened on to a higher trajectory (8 per cent) during January-June 2018. Slack has been pulled in and capacity utilisation is getting stretched. Rural and urban spend is strengthening to a point where aggregate demand, especially private consumption, is likely running ahead of the supply response, even as the outlook for agriculture, manufacturing and construction is brightening and a gradual upturn is taking hold in various services sectors. 51. The evolving macroeconomic configuration warrants an appropriate policy response. With the downward level shift in the projections relative to the August resolution, especially during January-June 2019, it is reasonable to keep the policy rate on hold in this meeting and to monitor the cumulative 50 basis points increase in June and August as it works its way through the economy. Stakeholders are anticipating this transmission \u2013 households have lowered their expectations of one year ahead inflation, while professional forecasters have revised downwards their outer forecasts of headline inflation. Yet, inflation is set to rise over the period ahead in an environment in which the balance of risks is shifting to the upside. Monetary policy needs to move to high alert, and this needs to be reflected in a pro-active policy stance. Overarchingly, monetary policy needs to stay focused on its mandate \u2013 the target of 4 per cent inflation, while keeping in mind the objective of growth \u2013 within the RBI\u2019s overall policy framework that assigns appropriate instruments to goals in order to secure efficient policy outcomes. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 53. Since the August policy, food inflation has surprised dramatically on the downside. Seasonal pickup in prices of vegetables and fruits in summer months was simply missing due to a combination of increased mandi arrivals, export policies and other supply management measures. This, coupled with a normal monsoon, has shifted RBI's food inflation projections significantly downward. Elsewhere, fuel inflation continues its rapid upward march. While inflation excluding 54. food and fuel has eased marginally due to lower momentum in certain goods and services, it remains at elevated levels. International crude oil prices keep surging as Iran sanctions approach, creating a difficult choice between pass-through to the pump prices and fiscal or quasi-fiscal absorption through excise cuts. The rising oil prices also coincide with the misfortune of weaker current account balance, inducing financial market volatility which raises imported inflation, though the direct impact of oil price on inflation via the consequent fare price impact is much 55. While there was mild softening in the 12-month ahead inflation expectations of households between the June 2018 and September 2018 rounds of RBI\u2019s surveys, the 3-month expectations showed a sharp uptick. I am particularly concerned about the near 200 basis points increase in the 3-month and 12-month inflation expectations of households, based on the surveys of September 2017 to September 2018. Households are telling us that their inflation outlook has moved palpably upwards. Business expectations of headline inflation as well as input costs are showing similar trends, rising steadily in RBI's and other surveys. 56. As a result, headline inflation for Q1:2019-20 is projected at 4.8% vis-\u00e0-vis the mandated target of 4%, in spite of the benign food inflation outlook. Between the time the projections were finalised for the Monetary Policy Report (specifically, October 1) and today (October 5), oil prices have risen steeply, without any signs of durable supply adjustment amidst strong global demand. 57. Growth has been reasonably buoyant as evidenced by the real economic activity indicators for both the rural economy and the urban counterpart. Our estimates of the output gap suggest it has virtually closed as per the traditional measures; my preferred finance-neutral output gap measure has in fact turned positive due to asset price growth and especially non-food credit growth that is now in excess of the nominal GDP growth rate. 58. In such a milieu, the likelihood of oil prices remaining elevated rules out a rate cut anytime soon. Second round effects of the steep oil price rise can generalise causing inflation expectations to unhinge. Even if pass-through to pump prices is made less than one for one, inflation risk would generalise through fiscal slippage. 59. Given these factors, and given the flexible inflation-targeting mandate of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), it seems important to signal commitment to keeping to the mandate and move forward carefully at an appropriate time, allowing the economy to adjust to the past two back-to-back rate hikes while being vigilant of any emerging inflationary pressures. Hence, I vote for not to raise the policy rate but change the stance of monetary policy to 60. one of \u201ccalibrated tightening\u201d. 61. Headline inflation adjusted for the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees moderated significantly from 4.6 per cent in June 2018 to 3.8 per cent in July and further to 3.4 per cent in August, reversing the trend of previous three months. Food inflation continued to surprise on the downside, declining sharply from 3.1 per cent in June to 0.9 per cent by August in the absence of a seasonal pick up in prices of key vegetables and fruits in summer months. Inflation in items other than food and fuel also moderated due mainly to softening in housing, clothing and transportation. However, inflation in the fuel group increased reflecting higher international petroleum product prices. Overall, actual inflation turnouts in July and August were lower than the projections set out in the August resolution of the MPC. 62. Going forward, excluding the HRA impact, CPI inflation is projected at 3.7 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.8-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20. The outlook for inflation continues to face several upside pressures, which include: (i) uncertainty surrounding the impact of the increase in minimum support prices of kharif crops on food inflation; (ii) surge in crude oil prices; (iii) heightened volatility in financial markets of emerging economies; (iv) a further increase in inflation expectations of households at three-month horizon, which when combined with rising input costs, may impact price and wage setting behaviour, though it is comforting that one-year ahead inflation expectations have moderated; (v) the risk of fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state level; and (vi) second round effects on inflation on account of the staggered HRA revisions by various state governments, though the direct statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through. The GDP growth print for Q1 of 2018-19 touched a high of 8.2 per cent, driven by robust 63. private consumption and investment activity, suggesting that growth impulses, thus far, continue to be buoyant. The first advance estimates of production of major kharif crops are reassuring, considering spatially and temporally uneven monsoon. Going forward, consumption is expected to be sustained. Though rising oil prices and tightening of financial conditions may have a bearing on investment demand, overall economic activity is expected to be resilient with GDP growth for 2018-19 projected at 7.4 per cent (as in the August resolution). GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 is projected marginally lower at 7.4 per cent vis-\u00e0-vis 7.5 per cent in the August resolution. 64. The policy repo rate was raised by 25 basis points each in the last two consecutive meetings of the MPC in June and August. Moderation in inflation in the last two months has lowered the projected inflation trajectory. I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. Recognising that inflation risks have been persistent, and to reaffirm the commitment to securing the mandated 4 per cent inflation target on a durable basis, it is apposite to change the stance of monetary policy from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201ccalibrated tightening\u201d. \u201cCalibrated tightening\u201d means that in the current rate cycle, a cut in the policy repo rate is off the table, and we are not obliged to increase the rate at every policy meeting.
