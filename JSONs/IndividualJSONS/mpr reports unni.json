{"file1": "Box III.1: Consumption Switching? Unravelling the Drivers behind Changing Consumption Patterns in India The outlook for domestic economic activity remains resilient buoyed by strong consumption and investment activities. Geopolitical conflicts, uncertain global outlook, volatile global financial markets amidst changing perceptions on monetary policy trajectories, and climate shocks are the key risks to the outlook. Monetary policy remains steadfast on aligning inflation with the target on a durable basis, setting strong foundations for a sustained period of high growth. Since the release of the April 2024 Monetary Policy Report (MPR), global economic activity has shown resilience in the face of continuing geopolitical tensions and intermittent financial market volatility. Disinflation in headline inflation has been slow due to stubborn services inflation which is keeping core inflation (i.e., CPI inflation excluding food & fuel) elevated, relative to the headline. Several central banks have started easing monetary policy while others have maintained a restrictive stance, leading to divergence in policy pathways. Financial markets have been on edge, with incoming data shifting expectations about the direction of monetary policy. Sovereign bond yields have trended downwards on anticipation of policy pivots. Global equity markets have exhibited resilience, recovering quickly and regaining risk-taking appetite in spite of stretched valuations and still high leverage. Capital flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) have resumed albeit amidst heightened volatility. The US dollar index peaked in mid-June and receded thereafter on signs of cooling labour market conditions and easing inflation. Supply chain pressures have inched up since May driven by conflicts in the Middle East. Global commodity prices declined on the back of softening prices of base metals, agricultural products, and energy, however, price pressures have increased recently amidst heightened geopolitical tensions. Brent crude oil prices, that were hovering around US dollar (US$) 90 per barrel in April 2024, have since declined \u2013 even dipping below US$ 70 briefly \u2013 due to slowdown in demand and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plus\u2019 intent to gradually restore supplies. Of late, the US dollar index, sovereign bond yields and crude oil prices have inched up. International prices of most agricultural commodities have risen due to increase in prices of vegetable oil, dairy and meat. Turning to the domestic economy, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.7 per cent in Q1:2024-25 as per the National Statistical Office (NSO). Private consumption expenditure registered a growth of 7.4 per cent, contributing 63 per cent to overall GDP growth. Consumption spending has been robust in Q1:2024-25, supported by rural demand which is expected to improve further on the back of favourable monsoon, higher sowing activity and moderating inflation. Investment activity also maintained its momentum in Q1, supported by high capacity utilisation, continued buoyancy in steel consumption and capital goods imports. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) expanded by 6.8 per cent in Q1, with industry and services sectors being the key drivers. Headline consumer price inflation moderated to 4.4 per cent in April-August 2024 from 5.2 per cent in H2:2023-24. Base effects continue to have an outsized role in monthly inflation prints. Consequently, the moderation in headline inflation has been uneven. Core inflation was on a steadily declining path\u2013 in May 2024, it fell to its lowest level of 3.1 per cent in the current series (since January 2012) before increasing in July-August. Food price inflation, on the other hand, remained elevated, averaging 6.9 per cent over the last five months (April-August 2024), and contributing 72.5 per cent of headline inflation during the period. Recognising the risks from volatile and elevated food prices and its likely adverse impact on inflation expectations and spillovers to core inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent through H1 and remained resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation with the target, while supporting growth. When the MPC met in April 2024, global economy was showing resilience and inflation was trending down. Financial markets were responding to the timing and pace of monetary policy trajectories, with heightened uncertainty pushing up gold prices on safe haven demand. The domestic economic momentum appeared strong, supported by healthy bank and corporate sector balance sheets and upbeat business and consumer sentiments. Hence, the real GDP growth projection for 2024-25 was retained at 7 per cent. CPI headline inflation had softened in January- February 2024 from its December high although food inflation edged up. The MPC noted the uncertainties around the inflation trajectory stemming from weather-driven food price shocks, cost push pressures, firming crude oil prices due to geopolitical tensions and volatility in financial markets, and retained the projection of CPI inflation for 2024-25 at 4.5 per cent. The MPC observed that food price pressures have been interrupting the ongoing disinflation process, posing challenges for the final descent of inflation to the target. Considering that the path of disinflation has to be sustained till inflation reaches the 4 per cent target on a durable basis, MPC also decided, by a 5-1 majority, to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent. The MPC decided by a majority of 5-1 to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation so as to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. At the time of June 2024 meeting, global growth was sustaining momentum. Central banks remained steadfast and data-dependent in their fight against inflation, acknowledging that the final leg of disinflation might be tough. High frequency indicators for domestic economic activity showed resilience, with expectations of above normal monsoon brightening the prospects of agriculture sector and rural demand. Investment demand in the private sector was buoyed by high capacity utilisation and healthy balance sheet of banks and corporates while improving world trade was expected to support external demand. The projection of real GDP growth for 2024-25 was revised upwards by 20 basis points from the previous meeting to 7.2 per cent. In India, headline CPI inflation moderated for three successive months to 4.8 per cent in April 2024. Food inflation was persistently high while core inflation had fallen to historic lows. Nevertheless, the future inflation trajectory remained uncertain due to supply shocks, input cost pressures and crude oil price volatility. The projection of CPI inflation for 2024-25 was retained at 4.5 per cent. The MPC noted that while the growth-inflation balance had moved favourably since its previous meeting, risks to inflation remain from recurring food price shocks and monetary policy has to stay watchful of the spillovers of food price pressures to core inflation and inflation expectations. Accordingly, the MPC decided by a majority of 4-2 to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent. The MPC voted with a 4-2 majority to continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. In the run up to August 2024 meeting, headline inflation, after remaining steady at 4.8 per cent during April and May 2024, increased to 5.1 per cent in June 2024, primarily driven by the food component even though fuel prices remained in deflation and core inflation touched new lows. Assuming a normal monsoon, CPI inflation projection for 2024- 25 was retained at 4.5 per cent. Domestic economic activity was strengthening, with the pick-up in southwest monsoon rainfall and improved spatial spread translating into higher kharif sowing. Other high frequency indicators suggested expansion in services activity. A revival in private consumption has been underway with rural demand catching up with urban consumption. The pickup in investment activity gathered strength as reflected by expansion in steel consumption, high capacity utilisation and the government\u2019s thrust on infra-spending. The projection of real GDP growth for 2024-25 was retained at 7.2 per cent. The MPC observed that risks from volatile and elevated food prices remain high, which may adversely impact inflation expectations and result in spillovers to core inflation. Accordingly, the MPC decided by a majority of 4-2 to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent while retaining the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. The MPC\u2019s voting pattern reflects the diversity in individual members\u2019 assessments, expectations and policy preferences - a characteristic also reflected in voting patterns of other central banks (Table I.1). With the emerging view that the disinflation process is in its final leg, a larger number of central banks have begun an easing cycle while others have retained policy rates at restrictive levels. EME central banks that began policy rate easing have undertaken larger cuts since April 2024 while two major advanced economies (AEs) the US and the United Kingdom - have begun their policy pivot in the second half of 2024. Chapters analyse macroeconomic developments relating to inflation and economic activity during H1:2024-25 (April-September 2024). Turning to the baseline assumptions, international crude prices exhibited sizeable two-way movements in H1, receding from their five-month peak of US$ dollar (US$) 91 per barrel in early April 2024 to US$ 77 per barrel by early June 2024 on slowing demand in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and easing supply conditions. In September 2024, they were settling around US$ 71-78 per barrel. While global growth uncertainties on the demand side and geopolitical tensions on the supply side impart significant volatility to the outlook (Charts I.1a and I.1b), easing Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. global demand-supply refinery divergences have reduced the wedge between global petroleum product prices and crude prices (Chart I.1c). Considering these factors, crude prices (Indian basket) are assumed at US$ 80 per barrel in the baseline as compared with US$ 85 in the April 2024 MPR (Table I.2). Second, the nominal exchange rate of the Indian rupee (\u20b9) saw two-way movements in the range of \u20b983-84 per US$ in H1, with a depreciating bias since July 2024. Taking into consideration the uncertainty around US dollar movements, the ebbs and flows of global capital flows and international crude oil prices, the exchange rate is assumed at INR 83.5 per US dollar in the baseline as against INR 83 in the April 2024 MPR. forecast for 2025 to 3.3 per cent in its July World Economic Outlook (WEO) compared with April 2024 update. With modest recovery on the global front, the projection for global growth in 2024 and 2025 is still below the historical annual average1 of 3.8 per cent. Inflation is projected to fall from 5.9 per cent in 2024 to 4.4 per cent in 2025. The pace of decline in inflation to targets, however, is likely to be faster in Third, repeated geopolitical tensions, rekindled fears of a potential recession in key economies and financial market volatility in response to monetary policy divergence weigh heavily on global growth prospects. The global composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) has exhibited moderation since May 2024 with PMI manufacturing in contraction zone since July 2024. The IMF retained the global growth estimate for 2024 at 3.2 per cent and revised upwards its growth AEs vis-\u00e0-vis EMEs (Chart I.2). Global trade growth is estimated to rebound to 3.1 per cent in 2024 from 0.8 per cent in 2023, notwithstanding the surge in cross- border trade restrictions that pose risks to the global trade outlook. In H1:2024-25 (up to August), headline inflation remained within the tolerance band while food inflation remained elevated and persistent (Chapter II). In the September 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey2, the three months and one year ahead median inflation expectations of urban households reduced by 20 and 10 bps to 9.2 per cent and 10.0 per cent, respectively, vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate declined for both horizons vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round (Chart I.3). Manufacturing firms polled in the July - September 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expect pressures from cost of raw materials to continue, with some softening and selling price growth momentum to continue in Q3:2024-25 (Chart I.4a).3 Services sector companies and infrastructure firms expect input cost pressures to persist and selling prices growth to moderate in Q3:2024-25 (Charts I.4b and I.4c).4 In the PMI surveys for September Note: Net response is the difference between the share of respondents reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism. The range is -100 to 100. A positive/ negative value of net response is considered as optimistic/pessimistic from the view point of respondent firms. Therefore, higher positive values of selling prices indicate increase in output prices while lower values for the cost of raw materials/cost of inputs indicate higher input price pressures and vice versa.

Nevertheless, rising global supply chain pressures, adverse weather events, Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in September 2024 expect headline CPI inflation to increase from 4.0 per cent in Q2:2024-25 to 4.6 per cent in Q3, 4.4 per cent in Q4 and 4.2-4.5 per cent in H1:2025-26 (Chart I.5a and Table I.3).5 Core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and beverages, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, and fuel and light) is expected to successively increase from 3.5 per cent in Q2:2024- 25 to 3.9 per cent in Q3 and is expected to remain between 4.2-4.3 per cent in the next three quarters.In the September 2024 round, their 5-year ahead expected inflation remained unchanged at 4.5 per cent, while their 10-year ahead expectations moderated to 4.3 per cent as compared to 4.5 per cent in the previous round (Chart I.5b). Credit growth of scheduled commercial banks Combined gross fiscal deficit (per cent of GDP) Looking ahead, evolving food inflation dynamics will impinge upon the outlook for inflation. The above normal south-west monsoon rainfall, significantly higher reservoir levels as compared to decadal average and higher kharif sowing vis-a-vis last year bode well Note: GNDI: Gross National Disposable Income.

The downside risks could materialise from an early resolution of geopolitical conflicts; weakening of global demand accompanied by further easing of global food and commodity prices; improvement in supply conditions; and proactive supply side measures by the government.

Source: RBI staff estimates. volatile food prices and continuing geopolitical strife remain key risks. Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from time-series and structural models6, CPI inflation is projected to average 4.5 per cent in 2024-25 \u2013 4.1 per cent in Q2, 4.8 per cent in Q3 and 4.2 per cent in Q4, with risks evenly balanced (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2024- 25 are 3.2-5.2 per cent and 2.6-5.8 per cent, respectively. For 2025-26, assuming a normal monsoon, and no further exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will average 4.1 per cent with 4.3 per cent in Q1, 3.7 per cent in Q2, 4.2 per cent in Q3 and 4.1 per cent in Q4. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2025-26 are 2.8-5.4 per cent and 2.1-6.1 per cent, respectively. The baseline forecasts are subject to several upside and downside risks. The upside risks emanate from Domestic economic activity resilient. Improved performance of industrial sector, upturn in investment activity, above normal monsoon, pick up in rural demand, high capacity utilisation, healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, and the government\u2019s continued thrust on infrastructure spending augur well for the growth outlook. Uncertain lingering global economic outlook, geopolitical conflicts, rising supply chain pressures, and volatile global financial conditions, however, weigh heavily on the outlook to the downside. Turning to the key messages from forward-looking surveys, consumer confidence (the current situation index) improved in the September 2024 survey round vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round on account of better perceptions about the general economic, employment, and income conditions. Consumers\u2019 optimism for the year ahead, measured by the future expectations index, also improved in the latest round vis-\u00e0-vis the previous one (Chart I.7).7 Optimism in the manufacturing sector for Q3:2024-25 improved in the July- September 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey (Chart I.8a). Services and infrastructure companies continue to maintain a highly optimistic outlook for Q3:2024-25 (Charts I.8b and I.8c). 6 Joice John, Deepak Kumar, Asish Thomas George, Pratik Mitra, Muneesh Kapur and Michael Debabrata Patra (2023), \u201cA Recalibrated Quarterly Projection Model (QPM 2.0) for India\u201d, Reserve Bank of India Bulletin, February, Volume LXXVII(2), pp.59-77. 7 The Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 (13 cities in the previous rounds) and the results of the September 2024 round are based on responses from 6,087 respondents. Recent surveys by other agencies report sequential improvement in business expectations relative to the previous round (Table I.4). Manufacturing and services firms in the PMI surveys for September 2024 remained upbeat for the year ahead though a marginal deceleration in expectations is observed vis-\u00e0-vis the previous month for manufacturing firms. Real GDP growth exceeded 8 per cent growth in the first three quarters of 2023-24 before dipping Professional forecasters polled in the September 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey expected real GDP marginally to 7.8 per cent in Q4.

These baseline assumptions are, however, subject to uncertainties emanating from favourable monsoon rainfall; strengthening manufacturing and services sector activity sustained events. In this context, this section explores the by strong domestic demand; retreating global and plausible alternative scenarios to assess the balance Global economic activity is subject to uncertainties going forward. Policy divergence among major central growth and inflation could turn out to be higher by around 15 bps and 7 bps, respectively (Charts I.11a and I.12a). banks could trigger heightened volatility in global financial markets, with spillovers to emerging market economies. Services price and wage inflation remain might keep global interest rates higher for longer, The global economic outlook is also subject to in economic policies resulting from impending elections in major economies. In case these downside risks materialise, and, if global growth is 100 bps inflation could be lower than baseline projections by there is faster convergence in global disinflation and alignment in monetary policy paths going Global crude oil prices have exhibited some moderation, with Brent crude falling from a high of US$ 93 per barrel in mid-April 2024 to US$73 per barrel by end-September. Global growth recovery, continuation of geo-political tensions and non- reversal of production cut by OPEC plus may put upward pressure on crude oil prices. In this scenario, assuming crude oil price to be 10 per cent above the baseline and full pass-through to domestic product prices, domestic inflation could be higher by 30 bps and growth weaker by around 15 bps, respectively. Conversely, early resolution of geopolitical tensions, weak global demand, higher production from non- OPEC economies along with unwinding of production cuts by OPEC plus may soften crude oil prices. If crude oil prices fall by 10 per cent relative to the baseline, inflation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 15 bps to India\u2019s real GDP growth (Charts I.11a and I.12a). geopolitical tensions, there can be an upside to global growth. If global growth is higher by 50 bps, domestic The Indian Rupee (INR) has remained steady against the US dollar, being least volatile among major EME currencies in recent months. Going ahead, restrictive monetary policy by major AEs to achieve the last mile of disinflation could limit attractiveness of EME assets and trigger reversal of capital flows. Crude oil and other global commodity prices could also harden in comparison with the baseline. In this scenario, if INR could be higher by around 35 bps while GDP growth could edge up by around 25 bps through short term stimulation of exports. On the other hand, the Indian economy remains the fastest growing major economy globally and is poised to play an important role in revival of global growth. These developments, along would attract foreign investors. In this scenario, if the Food inflation remained persistently high in H1:2024- 25, driven by high prices in cereals and pulses along with large shocks to vegetable prices triggered by recurrent adverse climate events of rising intensity. Further, food prices may be subject to extreme weather events such as excess rains and floods affecting kharif crops, unseasonal rains typically associated with extreme La Ni\u00f1a conditions, which may result in damage of winter crops and perishables. In such a scenario, there could be upward pressures on food prices and could raise headline inflation by around 50 bps over the baseline. Persistent shocks to food inflation warrant a cautious approach by monetary policy to contain spillover effects (Box I.1). On the other hand, kharif sowing remained robust, with higher acreage for major crops. Reservoir levels, too, are higher than both last year\u2019s levels and the decadal average, which augurs well for the rabi season. These developments along with effective supply management measures may result in easing of food inflation pressures and could lower headline inflation by 50 bps compared with the baseline (Charts I.11b and I.12b). inflation and GDP growth could moderate by around 35 no policy response. In the event of repeated shocks are conditional on the size and duration of shocks to food to food inflation, however, there may be spillover to prices and their transmission to headline inflation.

The Government\u2019s capex push corporate and bank balance sheets and improved outlook of global growth and trade are further aiding downward trajectory and is expected to moderate further in 2024-25, though the pace may be slow and uneven. Core inflation has bottomed out but remains subdued, supported by disinflationary monetary policy. The last mile of disinflation is contingent upon reining in food inflation and checking its spillover impact on inflation expectations and core inflation. Monetary policy remains steadfast on aligning inflation with the target. Geopolitical conflicts, uncertain global outlook, volatile global financial markets, and climate shocks remain key risks to the growth and inflation outlook. the growth momentum. Headline inflation is on a Headline CPI inflation after remaining sticky till June 2024, fell sharply thereafter buoyed by favourable base effects. The wedge between headline and core inflation widened further in June, before moderating in July- August. Input costs have remained subdued while rural wages and manufacturing staff cost growth decelerated. Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation1 remained sticky at around 5 per cent during March to June 2024, with key groups displaying considerable divergence. Food inflation edged up from an elevated level of 7.8 per cent in February 2024 to 8.4 per cent by June under the impact of repeated supply-side shocks. Deflation in fuel prices deepened from (-)0.8 per cent in February to (-)3.6 per cent in June. Core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation2 softened from 3.4 per cent to 3.1 per cent over the same period, the lowest reading recorded in the current CPI (2012=100) series so far. The wedge between headline and core inflation widened, from 1.7 percentage points in February 2024 to 2.0 percentage points in June. In July-August 2024, headline CPI inflation fell sharply to 3.6-3.7 per cent, buoyed by large favourable base effects in July, which also pulled food inflation down to 5.1-5.3 per cent. Core inflation edged up to around fuel prices intensified (Chart II.1). to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections, if any, and explain the underlying reasons thereof. The April 2024 MPR had projected outcomes have largely mirrored these projections. 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in the all-India consumer price index (CPI) produced by the National Statistical Office (NSO). 2 Core CPI, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups \u2018food and beverages\u2019 and \u2018fuel and light\u2019 from the headline CPI. in Q2 (July to September), induced by large favourable base effects in July, was also confirmed by actual September) had also factored in a likely pick-up in favourable base effects. In the second phase from July, CPI price momentum remained firm across food and core groups, while statistical gains from favourable base effects pulled down headline CPI inflation by 1.5 percentage points to 3.6 per cent. In August, the modest increase in headline inflation by 5 basis points (bps) to around 3.7 per cent reflected base effects only as the overall prices remained unchanged (Chart II.3). have undergone two distinct phases. First, after moderating to 4.9 per cent in March from 5.1 per cent in February, on favourable base effects and a sharp fall in fuel price momentum3, headline inflation remained steady at 4.8 per cent in April-May and edged up thereafter to 5.1 per cent in June due to a sharp pick up in price momentum triggered by an The distribution of CPI inflation in 2024 so far (January-August) reflects a lower median and mean along with lower standard deviation than a year ago when large and multiple food price shocks had played an outsized role (Chart II.4). Stickiness in headline inflation between January-June 2024 was accompanied by a considerable divergence in food, fuel and core inflation trajectories. In July-August, increase in food prices, notwithstanding significant 3 A change in CPI year-on-year (y-o-y) inflation between any two months is the difference between the current month-on-month (m-o-m) change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details, see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. a fall in food inflation led to narrowing of these divergences (Chart II.5). Diffusion indices (DIs)4 remained in high expansionary zone between March and August 2024, indicative of positive price increases across a broad spectrum of the CPI basket. After recording a transient uptick in March 2024, headline CPI DI dipped in April-May across both goods and services components. During June-August 2024, headline CPI DI edged up due to wider dispersion of price increases, first in goods and thereafter in services (Chart II.6a).

The higher the reading above 50, the broader is the expansion or generalisation of price increases; the further is the reading below 50, the broader is the price decline across items. 5 Threshold diffusion indices capture the dispersion of price increases in CPI basket beyond the specified saar thresholds of 4 per cent and 6 per cent. 6 per cent on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (saar) basis \u2013 continued to remain well below the 50 level mark, indicating little incidence of any broad- basing of such price momentum (Chart II.6b). to overall inflation - after being the major driver of inflation in the last four successive quarters - and from the disinflationary impact of past monetary policy actions (Chart II.7a). A historical decomposition of inflation using a vector autoregression (VAR)6 model indicates that the moderation in inflation in Q2:2024-25 stemmed from the negative contribution of supply side shocks Goods inflation (with a weight of 76.6 per cent in the overall CPI) contributed around 88 per cent of headline inflation between March and June 2024 and around 82 per cent in July and August 2024 (Chart II.7b). The contribution of services (with a weight of 23.4 per cent) edged up over this period due to the pick-up 6 Historical decomposition estimates the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period (Q4:2010-11 to Q4:2024-25) based on a vector autoregression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 crude oil prices (US$ per barrel); exchange rate (INR per US$), asset price (BSE Sensex), CPI; the output gap; rural wages; the policy repo rate; and money supply (M3). All variables other than policy repo rate are y-o-y growth rates. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt = c + A Yt-1 + et; where et represents a vector of shocks. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. in mobile tariffs. The increase in the contribution of perishable items (non-durable with a 7-day recall7), which include vegetables, spices, fruits and other food items such as milk, meat and fish and prepared meals, contributed to the stickiness in inflation in Q1. The contribution of semi-perishables (non- durable goods with a 30-day recall) to overall inflation remained broadly unchanged with cereals, pulses, and personal care items being the main inflation drivers. The contribution of durable items (goods with a 365- day recall) to overall inflation edged up during April- August 2024, primarily reflecting the uptick in gold prices. Food and beverages (weight of 45.9 per cent in the CPI basket) inflation exhibited distinct phases during the year so far. It averaged 8.0 per cent during April- June 2024, as weather disturbances such as heatwave conditions and uneven rainfall distribution, as well as tight supply conditions led to inflationary pressures in vegetables, cereals, and pulses. There was, however, a sharp moderation in food inflation to 5.1 per cent in July 2024, as favourable base effects more than offset a significant pickup in momentum. In August, despite a decline in food price momentum, food inflation increased to 5.3 per cent due to unfavourable base effects (Chart II.8). imported components8 to The contribution of headline inflation turned positive from April 2024 and increased gradually to 0.5 percentage points by August 2024, driven by higher gold and silver prices (Chart II.7c). The food price build-up during 2024-25 so far (up to August) has been substantial, although lower than last year and the long-term historical average. High 7 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Under MMRP, data are collected on expenditure incurred during the last seven days for frequently purchased items like edible oil, eggs, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, spices, beverages, processed foods, pan, tobacco and intoxicants; expenditure incurred during the last 365 days for items like clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods; and expenditure incurred in the last 30 days for all other food, fuel and light, miscellaneous goods and services including non-institutional medical services, rents and taxes. 8 Global commodities that drive domestic prices include petroleum products; coal; electronic goods; gold; silver; chemical products; metal products; textiles; cereals; milk products, and vegetables oils \u2013 these together have a weight of 36.4 per cent in the CPI basket. Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI - food and beverages. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. vegetable prices contributed a disproportionately large share to this build-up for the second successive year in a row (Chart II.9). Cereals (weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group) inflation remained elevated at an average of 8.3 per cent during April-August 2024 (Chart II.10). Within cereals, rice inflation remained in double digits, despite export restrictions, reflecting tight supply conditions due to lower rabi and summer production [(-)2.4 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2023-24]. For effective supply management and price stabilisation, government has announced several measures including the retail sale of \u2018Bharat Rice\u2019 and allowing rice-deficient states to directly purchase rice from the Food Corporation of India at a fixed price of \u20b92800/quintal under the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) from August 2024. The buffer stocks of rice (3.0 times the norm as of September 16, 2024) are comfortable and kharif sowing has been higher by 2.5 per cent in 2024-25 as on September 27, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of last year, which are likely to improve supply conditions and contain price pressures. With signs of easing of supply conditions, government has lifted the ban on exports of non-basmati white rice subject to a minimum export price (MEP) of $490/tonne, while removing the MEP on Basmati rice in September 2024 to support farmers\u2019 price realisation. Wheat inflation, on the other hand, was moderating till February 2024, but it hardened thereafter to reach 6.6 per cent in August, reflecting lower buffer stocks (0.9 times the norm as of September 16, 2024) and lower mandi arrivals than in 2023-24. Wheat inflation was elevated despite higher production and price stabilisation measures, including the imposition of stock limits for traders/wholesalers and retailers till March 2025, the likely offloading of stocks under the OMSS and continued restrictions on wheat exports. Vegetables (weight of 6.0 per cent in the CPI and 13.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) inflation remained elevated till June 2024, but witnessed a sharp correction in July primarily because of favourable base effect (Chart II.11). The price momentum, however, remained firm in July, reflecting lower production [(-)3.2 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23 as per 3rd advance estimates (AE) 2023-24] and supply disruptions due to heatwave conditions in parts of northern India, excess rains in parts of central and southern India and the resultant lower market arrivals. As supplies resumed, Note: Figures in parentheses indicate items' weights in CPI-vegetables. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. vegetable prices declined in August, particularly from increased sequentially in 2024, reaching 65 per cent in July-August, driven by production shortfalls [(-)5.1 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23 as per 3rd AE 2023- producing states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Bihar. Onion prices moderated during January- February 2024, but started rising again, recording a y-o-y inflation of 60.6 per cent in July 2024 and 54.1 per cent in August due to deficient production [(-)19.7 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23 as per 3rd AE 2023-24]. For effective supply management, onion exports were allowed and 40 per cent export duty with a MEP of $550 per metric tonne was imposed in May 2024. Subsequently, in September 2024, the export duty was reduced to 20 per cent, and MEP was removed, allowing free shipments of onion. Tomato price increase, which averaged around 37 per cent during December 2023-June 2024 on a y-o-y basis, was on account of tight supply conditions induced by heatwaves and unseasonal rainfall. Prices declined by (-)43.0 per cent, on a y-o-y basis, in July 2024 as a strong favourable base effect outweighed the substantial increase in price momentum. Softening in prices in August further pulled down tomato inflation to (-)47.9 per cent. Vegetables excluding TOP (tomato; onion; and potato), particularly garlic, also witnessed considerable price build-up in Q1:2024- 25, emerging as another major driver of vegetables inflation (Chart II.12). Inflation in fruits (weight of 2.9 per cent in the CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages group) eased in July on a strong favourable base effect, after rising during April-June 2024 to 6.3 per cent on average. In August, it rose to 6.5 per cent despite higher production (2.3 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23 as per the 3rd AE), with price increases primarily driven by bananas, apples and mangoes. Inflation in groundnut prices, however, moderated from around 10.4 per cent in December 2023 to 1.7 per cent in July 2024 before falling into the deflationary zone at (-)1.5 per cent in August 2024, on account of higher kharif production (1.1 per cent in 2023-24). Pulses, the primary source of plant-based protein (weight of 2.4 per cent in the CPI and 5.2 per cent in the food and beverages group), continued to record double-digit inflation due to deficient kharif and rabi production [(-)7.0 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23] on top of a decline in production in 2022-23. Within pulses, lower production of gram [(-)10 per cent in 2023-24], urad [(-)11.9 per cent] and moong [(-)15.6 per cent] as well as subdued production in tur (3.2 per cent increase in 2023-24 over 2022-23 against 21.5 per cent decline in 2022-23) were the primary drivers of price pressures (Chart II.13). Inflation in pulses prices moderated to 13.6 per cent in August 2024 on interventions to ease supply conditions through imposition of stock limits on tur and gram (till September 30, 2024), extension of free import policy for yellow peas (till December 31, 2024), and tur and urad (till March 31, 2025), weekly stock disclosure requirements for five major pulses, and sale of chana dal under the brand \u2018Bharat Dal\u2019. As a result, the stock-to-use ratio improved to 6.8 per cent during April-August 2024 from 6.5 per cent during the corresponding period of 2023 (Chart II.14). Animal-based protein items exhibited high and volatile inflation movements during April-August 2024. Inflation in prices of meat and fish (weight of 3.6 per cent in the CPI and 7.9 per cent in the food and beverages group) averaged 6.2 per cent during April-August 2024. Inflation in the price of eggs (weight of 0.43 per cent in the CPI and 0.9 per cent in the food and beverages group) exhibited considerable volatility, falling from 10.3 per cent in March to 4.1 per cent in June before increasing to 7.1 per cent in August. Inflation in milk and products (weight of 6.6 per cent in the CPI and 14.4 per cent within the food and beverages group) has remained range bound at around 3 per cent during April-August. Although milk price hikes by several cooperatives, including Amul and Mother Dairy, in June 2024 led to higher price momentum in June, it was offset by favourable base effects (Chart II.15). 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A 4 2 - r p A 4 2 - g u A Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI-animal protein group.

The pace of deflation, however, moderated, with continued positive momentum reflecting pick-up in international edible oil prices as 2023-24 season [(-)4.1 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022- 23]. The current kharif season sowing of oilseeds has been encouraging, particularly for groundnut. on crude palm, sunflower and soyabean oil were extended till March 2025. To improve domestic price refined edible oils has been hiked by 20 percentage points in September 2024. Among other items in the oils and fats sub-group, inflation in ghee and butter prices continued to moderate. 25 compared to H2:2023-24 despite lower sugarcane production [(-)7.6 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23]. Measures to augment domestic availability of sugar include extension of export restrictions, and imposition of 50 per cent export duty on molasses used for ethanol production as well as restriction on the use of sugarcane juice and syrup for ethanol production since December 2023. The restrictions on sugar diversion for ethanol production were, however, eased in August 2024. Among other food items, inflation in spices moderated on a sustained basis since April 2024 and slipped into deflation since July after recording double-digit inflation for a 22-month period till March 2024. The recent decline was led by jeera and dry chillies, on account of higher spices production (5.5 per cent as per 3rd AE in 2023-24 over 2022-23).

After recording a sustained increase between September 2023 and January 2024, pulses price margins witnessed a sustained decrease during February-September 2024. Retail price margins in edible oils continued to soften since June 2024, primarily due to the moderation in the margin of refined oils. Retail price margins of TOP vegetables started firming up from March 2024 onwards (Chart II.17). Heightened CPI food inflation pressures were seen across both rural and urban areas, with average rural food inflation during April to August 2024 outpacing its urban counterpart (Chart II.18). The deflation in fuel prices deepened from (-)0.8 per 2024, reflecting the cumulative impact of the LPG Fuel deflation was also aided by softening of price # Accounted for the unification of Daman and Diu with Dadra & Nagar Haveli and the formation of Ladakh as a Union Territory (UT).

(4) Figures in parentheses indicate items' weights in CPI-fuel group. Core (CPI excluding food and fuel) disinflation continued during H1 of 2024-25 (April-August) as it softened to 3.1 per cent by May-June 2024. This sustained sequential softening observed for more than a year (since June 2023) was disrupted in July- August 2024 with core inflation averaging 3.4 per cent, primarily reflecting the impact of mobile tariff revisions. Exclusion-based measures of underlying inflation, which remove volatile items such as petrol, diesel, gold, and silver in addition to food and fuel, also witnessed similar movements during this period (Chart II.20 and Table II.2). CPI excluding food and fuel (47.3) CPI excluding food fuel petrol diesel (45.0) CPI excluding food fuel petrol diesel gold silver (43.8) While diffusion index for CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver indicated positive price increases across much of its consitutents, a vast majority of these price increases were less than 6 per cent (m-o-m saar) and 4 per cent (m-o-m saar), as indicated by the steep fall in threshold DIs to well below the 50 level mark. Threshold DIs for CPI core, however, exhibited a sustained pick-up during June- August 2024, indicating a likely bottoming out of muted price momentum (Chart II.21).

The National Statistics Office (NSO) compiles the housing index for urban areas, considering both rented and self-owned dwellings.

Thereafter, WPI inflation softened in 5% trimmed 10% trimmed 25% trimmed softening continued in August on account of negative price momentum mainly coming from the food group. With overall WPI recording sequential increase since April 2024, inflation measured by deflators for gross value added (GVA) and gross domestic product (GDP) hardened in Q1:2024-25 (Chart II.25a). exhibited varying inflation movements. While WPI ruled above corresponding CPI groups/subgroups, and footwear was higher in the CPI than in the WPI. inflation picked up during April-June 2024 with food Similarly, deflation in petrol was lower in the WPI inflation registering a sharp uptick along with fuel vis-\u00e0-vis CPI, while the same was higher for diesel in and non-food manufactured products moving out Note: For Q1:2024-25, implicit GDP and GVA deflators are used.

Costs, as measured by WPI inflation in industrial raw materials and farm inputs, remained subdued during April-August 2024. While the prices of farm inputs remained in deflation, those of industrial inputs entered positive territory in June 2024, but turned negative again in August, mirroring movements in international commodity prices (Chart II.26). Prices of industrial inputs such as high-speed diesel (HSD), bitumen and petroleum coke were mostly in deflation during April-August 2024. The other contributory factors were non-food articles, particularly raw cotton and oilseeds, whose prices also recorded deflation during this period. Minerals price inflation, however, remained positive during April-August 2024, primarily driven by iron ore, due to increased global demand. Farm input prices remained in deflation, driven by those of high-speed diesel (HSD), electricity, and fodder and pesticides. Moving from input costs to wage costs, nominal rural wage growth (y-o-y) decelerated to 4.9 per cent in July 2024 from 5.7 per cent in March 2024 driven by both non-agricultural and agricultural occupations sustained a steady growth of around 0.45 per cent and month-on-month increase in agricultural wage was mainly driven by ploughing/tilling workers, followed by loggers and woodcutters, plant protection workers, and general agricultural labourers, while the increase in non-agricultural wages was on account of masons, electricians, and light motor vehicle and tractor drivers in the rural sector. Despite the deceleration in nominal rural wages, real rural wages (deflated using CPI rural inflation) recorded a marginal growth of 0.8 per cent in July from 0.2 per cent in March 2024, primarily reflecting the sharp fall in CPI rural inflation in July. prices are expected to soften across manufaturing, services and infrastructure sectors in Q3:2024-25. The pace of salary outgo is expected to moderate for services and infrastructure in Q3:2024-25 while it is anticipated to rise for manufacturing (Chart II.29). One year ahead business inflation expectations17 declined to 4.05 per cent in August 2024 from 4.21 per cent in the previous month on account of moderation in cost pressures with \u2018somewhat less than normal\u2019 or lower sales and subdued profit margin expectations. In the organised sector, staff cost growth (y-o-y) decelerated for manufacturing firms among listed companies in Q1:2024-25, while it remained steady for services firms. The share of staff cost in the value of production increased for manufacturing but stayed stable for services in Q1 (Chart II.28). Firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys16 indicate that in Q3:2024-25, the cost of inputs are expected to soften for manufacturing while and infrastructure sectors. On the other hand, selling remaining elevated As per the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), manufacturing firms, which had been reporting increasing input price pressures since March 2024, pointed to a moderation in the rate of input cost expansion during August-September 2024. In tandem with input prices, pace of output price increases across manufacturing also rose before decelerating in September 2024. This turned the input-output price gap for manufacturers marginally positive in September 2024. In case of services sector, the rate of expansion in input costs remained elevated during March-May 2024, before it saw a softening 16 Industrial Outlook Survey; and Services and Infrastructure Outlook Survey. 17 Based on the monthly Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

The prices charged across services firms, which had been lagging behind input price increases during March-June 2024, quickened in July 2024 on the back of pent up pass-through of rising labour and material costs. Subsequently, with cost pressures moderating, the rate of expansion in prices charged receded in August-September 2024 (Chart II.30). August) has been characterised by interruptions on core inflation. Food inflation could see an easing in H2 of 2024-25, benefiting from normal monsoons sustained, could impinge upon the food inflation muted with the continuing impact of disinflationary monetary policy stance and softening bias in international commodity prices. Recent pickup in global metals and crude oil prices and uncertainties on account of geopolitical developments need to be monitored. In the context of the apparent rigidities to the last mile of disinflation in the recent period, a steadfast commitment to alignment of inflation with the target is imperative to preserve and build upon the credibility gains in monetary policy achieved during the pre- and post-COVID flexible inflating targeting (FIT) period. A durable low inflation environment will strengthen the foundations of a sustained high growth trajectory. outlook. Core inflation pressures have remained Domestic economic activity in H1:2024-25 was supported by a strong performance from the two main drivers of aggregate demand \u2013 private consumption and investment activity. Improved agriculture prospects, sustained buoyancy in services, consumer and business optimism, government\u2019s continued thrust on capex, and healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates brighten the outlook.

As per the latest round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey, consumer confidence (current situation index) improved in September 2024, along with an improvement in households' optimism on one year ahead economic conditions. Bank credit to households grew in double digits, despite the slowdown in unsecured personal loans and credit cards outstanding that set in after the November 16, 2023 measures (Chart III.3d). but contracted in July-August 2024. The index of Rural demand is showing a gradual pickup. While motorcycle sales continued to record upbeat growth in April-August 2024, tractor sales expanded in June- July 2024 (Chart III.4). The demand for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) contracted by 16.6 per cent in Q2:2024-25, reflecting an improvement in farm sector employment. Spending on fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) in the rural areas bodes well for rural demand. The positive outlook for agriculture, supported by above normal south-west monsoon (SWM) rainfall, higher cumulative kharif sowing and improved reservoir levels augurs well for sustaining the revival in rural demand. consumption demand while economic boosts uncertainty dampens it. As consumption of necessary items have lower elasticity of substitution than discretionary items, they are more insulated from Box III.1: Consumption Switching? Unravelling the Drivers behind Changing Consumption Patterns in India There has been a slowdown in private final consumption growth rate of 5.4 per cent) when compared with the pre- COVID period1 (average growth of 6.7 per cent).

Drawing on the real business cycle literature (Kydland and Prescott, 1982), consumption switching is analysed at the aggregate level using a quantile regression framework, based on the following specification rates hurt consumption growth, and the effect increases in the upper quantiles, i.e., when consumption growth is high. The income effect improves consumption growth, but the impact gradually moderates when consumption growth is high. Economic uncertainty acts as a dampener 4 C is the q-o-q growth of Notes: Bands around the point estimates are 95 per cent bootstrapped confidence intervals. 1 Pre-COVID period includes Q1:2012-13 to Q4:2019-20. 2 Robustness checks are carried out using the economic uncertainty index derived from SPF data by Patra et. al. (2023). Results are in similar lines. Next, the precautionary motive is linked to consumption switching by looking at consumption growth at a broad commodity level. Following a nested Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) approach (Fernandez-Villaverde and Guerron-Quintana, 2020), intra-temporal choices of households are governed by elasticity of substitution among the necessary and discretionary group of commodities i.e. discretionary spending is expected to recover steadily as income strengthens. A watchful monetary policy restricts the spillover of price pressure to discretionary spending, facilitating a rebound of aggregate demand. Following this, the panel regression specification can be generalised as t-1( + ) = \u03b80 where Ct the consumption of j-th item in consumption j ) basket, D is the indicator variable for necessary/ N ) discretionary consumption basket. | is the inflation differentials between item \u03c0t group j and headline inflation.

The estimates show that the elasticity of substitution among the necessary items is lower than for discretionary items. The interest rate adversely impacts the consumption of discretionary items. Income effects strengthen the consumption of all items, and the effect is marginally higher on discretionary items. Policy uncertainty dampens consumption discretionary consumption demand (Table III.1.1). Standard errors in parentheses * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01 Baker, S. R., N. Bloom, and S. J.

Accommodative monetary policy helped offset the adverse effects of higher economic uncertainty, which led to lower consumption of discretionary items in the post- pandemic period, while essential spending remained largely unaffected.

Employment conditions remained robust in Q1:2024- capital goods expanded strongly during April-August, led by electronic goods, transport equipment and Construction activity gathered momentum on the back of an ebullient housing sector.

The interest coverage ratio (ICR)7 of listed private manufacturing companies improved in Q1:2024-25, indicating comfortable debt servicing capacity and conducive conditions for expansion in capacity. Within the services sector, the ICR of IT companies remained stable while that of non-IT companies stayed above the threshold level of unity (Chart III.8). Note: Data for Q1:2024-25 are based on results of 2,934 listed non-government non-financial companies. Source: RBI staff estimates. Interest coverage ratio is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to interest expenses and measures a company\u2019s capacity to make interest payments on its debt. The minimum value for a viable ICR is 1. Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) contracted by 0.2 per cent (y-o-y) in Q1:2024-25, pulling down overall GDP growth (Table III.1). The Government of India\u2019s (GoI) revenue expenditure excluding interest payments and major subsidies registered a modest increase of 3.1 per cent (y-o-y) during April-August 2024, whereas the capital expenditure contracted by 19.5 per cent during the same period8 (Chart III.9a). The revenue expenditure to capital outlay (RECO) ratio at 5.2 in April-August (4.1 a year ago) suggests some moderation in expenditure quality during the period. However, revenue deficit as per cent of gross fiscal deficit improved to 32.9 during the period (44.2 per cent a year ago) [Chart III.9b]. The Union Budget for 2024-25 reiterated the commitment towards fiscal prudence by budgeting a gross fiscal deficit (GFD) of 4.9 per cent of GDP, a drop of 66 basis points from the provisional actuals of 2023-24. This is in line with the medium-term target of achieving a GFD of less than 4.5 per cent of GDP by 2025-26. The quality of expenditure is budgeted to improve, with revenue expenditure to capital outlay ratio declining to an all-time low of 4.0. Moreover, capital expenditure is budgeted to increase to a two- decade high of 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2024-25 from 3.2 per cent in provisional actuals of 2023-24, which is expected to support growth during the year. On the receipts side, the central government\u2019s gross tax revenues increased by a 12.1 per cent (y-o-y) during April-August 2024, driven by a rise in income tax revenue. Indirect tax revenue expanded by 10.0 per cent (y-o-y), aided by goods and services tax (GST) collections (centre plus states) and customs duty collections. Overall, the robust tax collection is reflective of buoyant economy and effective enforcement by the tax authorities (Chart III.10). Custom duty receipts recorded a robust y-o-y increase of 12.9 per cent, whereas union excise duties grew by 4.2 per cent (y-o-y). Overall, net tax revenue of the central government increased by 8.7 per cent during April-August 2024 (Table III.2). Non-tax revenue receipts recorded a growth of 59.6 per cent primarily on the back of a surplus transfer of \u20b92.1 lakh crore from the Reserve Bank, which was 8 There has been a turnaround in Q2:2024-25 (July-August), with GoI's revenue expenditure excluding interest payments and major subsidies, and capital expenditure expanding by 9.6 per cent and 25.8 per cent, respectively.

Accordingly, the central government\u2019s gross fiscal deficit (GFD) during April- August 2024 stood at 27.0 per cent of the budget estimates, substantially lower than a year ago. The consolidated GFD of state governments is budgeted at 3.1 per cent of GDP in 2024-25, marginally higher than 2.9 per cent in 2023-24 provisional accounts (PA). Growth in revenue receipts is budgeted to accelerate to 19.1 per cent. States\u2019 capital spending is expected to rise by 21.0 per cent in 2024-25 on top of 23.4 per cent growth a year ago. The revenue deficit (RD) is expected to remain stable at 0.2 per cent of Notes: A: Actuals; PA: Provisional Accounts; BE: Budget Estimates. Data pertain to 31 States/UTs. Sources: Budget Documents of State Governments; and Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India. As per the data available for April-July 2024-25, states\u2019 GFD increased due to higher revenue expenditure and a contraction in grants from the GoI (Chart III.13a). Both tax and non-tax revenues, however, recorded robust growth (Chart III.13b). Meanwhile, on a y-o-y basis, capital expenditure declined. The Union Budget 2024-25 has made a provision of \u20b91.5 lakh crore for long-term interest-free loans, which could assist States in boosting their capital spending. The Union Budget for 2024-25 allocated gross and net market borrowings via dated securities amounting to \u20b914.01 lakh crore and \u20b911.63 lakh crore, respectively. In the first half of the fiscal year, the central government\u2019s gross market borrowings amounted to \u20b97.40 lakh crore, accounting for 52.8 per cent of the annual budget estimates (Table III.4). The weighted Note: Data pertain to 31 states/UTs. Sources: Budget Documents of State Governments; and CAG. average yield of these issuances during this period was 7.0 per cent, marginally lower than 7.2 per cent recorded in the previous year, while the weighted average maturity elongated to 20.7 years, up from 17.6 years. During H2, the Centre has planned gross market borrowings through dated securities of \u20b96.61 lakh crore. Concurrently, States raised \u20b93.86 lakh crore in gross market borrowings during H1:2024-25, against an indicative calendar amount of \u20b95.18 lakh crore. For Q3:2024-25, the indicative calendar has placed states\u2019 gross market borrowings at \u20b93.20 lakh crore. To meet the transitory mismatches between receipts and expenditures, the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) limit for the GoI was set at \u20b91.5 lakh crore for H1:2024-25; it has been fixed at \u20b950,000 crore for H2. Taking into account the recent expenditure trends, imports rose by 7.1 per cent (y-o-y) during this period. Consequently, the merchandise trade deficit widened to US$ 116.7 billion from US$ 99.2 billion during the corresponding period a year ago (Chart III.14). As per the estimates released by the NSO, exports of goods and services increased by 8.7 per cent y-o-y in real terms in Q1:2024-25, and imports of goods and services grew by 4.4 per cent. the WMA limits for States and Union Territories have been increased to \u20b960,118 crore from the previous limit of \u20b947,010 crore, effective from July 1, 2024.9 India\u2019s external demand revived in H1:2024-25 (April-August), buoyed by a recovery in global trade. Merchandise exports (US$) expanded by 1.1 per cent Merchandise exports growth, after experiencing a pickup in Q1:2024-25, contracted in Q2 (up to August). For H1:2024-25 (April-August), the growth in merchandise exports was mainly led by electronic goods, engineering goods, drugs and pharmaceuticals, readymade garments, and organic and inorganic chemicals. On the other hand, petroleum products, gems and jewellery, rice, marine products, and iron ore dragged down exports (Chart III.15). The expansion in merchandise imports in H1:2024- 25 (April-August) was driven by higher imports of petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL), gold and non- POL non-gold commodities such as electronic goods, transport equipment, and silver. Import of pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, chemical material and products, coal, coke and briquettes, fertilisers, and dyeing materials contributed negatively to the overall import growth (Chart III.16). POL imports grew by 9.2 per cent (y-o-y) to US$ 76.4 billion in H1 (April- August), while non-POL non-gold imports rose by 4.5 per cent (y-o-y) to US$ 196.2 billion during this period. Services exports remained buoyant, with a growth of 9.8 per cent y-o-y in Q1:2024-25 and 10.9 per 9 Based on the recommendations made by the Group constituted by the Reserve Bank and consisting of select State Finance Secretaries.

Among the major exporters of services globally, India retained its position in the top ten exporting countries during January-June 2024. Services imports moved out of the contractionary zone, posting a 7.2 per cent y-o-y On a balance of payments basis, the current account deficit widened marginally to 1.1 per cent of GDP in Q1:2024-25 from a deficit of 1.0 per cent of GDP in Q1:2023-24 and a surplus of 0.5 per cent of GDP in Q4:2023-24, mainly due to higher merchandise trade deficit.

Notes: Net FDI data for Q2: 2024-25 is up to July 2024. deficit (CAD) narrowed to 0.7 per cent of GDP from 2.0 per cent in 2022-23, driven by a lower merchandise trade deficit, robust services exports and substantial inward remittances. In the financial account, net FDI flows increased to US$ 4.9 billion in April-July 2024 from US$ 3.8 billion a year ago, on account of robust gross equity inflows (Chart III.18). Singapore, Mauritius, Netherlands, USA and Belgium were the major sources of FDI inflows, accounting for a share of 70.8 per cent. On the sectoral front, manufacturing, financial services, communication services, computer services and electricity and other generation, distribution and transmission attracted the majority of FDI equity inflows with a share of 77.3 per cent. External commercial borrowing flows moderated to US$ 3.6 billion in April-August 2024 from US$ 4.3 billion a year ago. On the other hand, net accretions to non-resident deposits surged to US$ 5.8 billion in April-July 2024 from US$ 3.0 billion a year ago, led by higher inflows in all three accounts [foreign currency non-resident (FCNR), non-resident external (NRE) and non-resident ordinary (NRO) accounts]. As on September 27, 2024 India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves amounted to US$ 704.9 billion, equivalent to 12.1 months of annualised merchandise imports as per BoP basis and 103.3 per cent of outstanding external debt at end-June 2024. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) moderated in Q1:2024-25 mainly due to net outflows in equities, though debt inflows have remained robust after the announcement of inclusion of Indian government bonds in the J.P.Morgan\u2019s benchmark emerging market index. FPI inflows, however, registered a turnaround in Q2:2024-25 with continued surge in debt inflows and a revival in equity flows. FPI inflows of US$ 20.1 billion were recorded in H1: 2024-25 as against net inflows of US$ 20.3 billion a year ago. Aggregate supply \u2013 measured by real gross value added (GVA) at basic prices \u2013 expanded by 6.8 per cent y-o-y in Q1:2024-25 (8.3 per cent a year ago)- a three-quarter high, supported by industry and services (Table III.5). The momentum of GVA improved over the previous quarter (Chart III.19). Real GVA in agriculture, forestry and fishing slowed to 2.0 per cent in Q1:2024-25 (3.7 per cent a year ago) on account of muted growth in foodgrains production Note: FRE: First revised estimates; PE: Provisional estimates.

By July 2, 2024, monsoon rainfall had covered the whole country and precipitation turned into a surplus of 8 per cent by September 30, 2024 (Chart III.20a). Out of the 36 sub-divisions, 33 experienced normal or above-normal rainfall, reflecting a broadly equitable distribution (Chart III.20b). The robust progression of monsoon rains enabled increased acreage of kharif sowing, which saw a 1.9 per cent rise over the previous year and exceeded normal sowing levels by 1.7 per cent as of September 27, 2024. The area devoted to all major crops, barring cotton, was greater than in the previous year. Specifically, the area under rice \u2013 constituting nearly 37 per cent of the kharif sowing area \u2013 rose by 2.5 per cent from the previous year\u2019s acreage. Similarly, the area covered by pulses and oilseeds sowing expanded by 7.4 per cent and 2.7 per cent, respectively (Chart III.20c). The enhanced rainfall also facilitated the replenishment of reservoir levels to 87 per cent of total capacity as of September 26, 2024, a marked improvement from the historically low levels recorded in June 2024 (Chart III.20d). With these elevated reservoir levels and the anticipated onset of La Ni\u00f1a later in the year, the outlook for rabi crop appears promising. As of September 30, 2024 the production-weighted rainfall index (PRN) stood at 107 per cent, surpassing the 93 per cent level recorded during the same period last year (Chart III.20e). The resurgence of rainfall in the North-Western states of India contributed to a higher PRN relative to the Note: saar - Seasonally adjusted annualised rate. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates.

Furthermore, the crop-specific PRN exceeded both last year's position and the five-year average across all crops (Chart III.20f). According to the final estimates of crop production for 2023-24, total foodgrain production at 3,323 lakh tonnes recoded an increase of 0.8 per cent over the final estimates of 2022-23 and 1.0 per cent over the third advance estimates of 2023-24. Among major crops, rice and wheat production increased on y-o-y basis by 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively, whereas coarse cereals, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane and cotton recorded a decline in production during the year (Table III.6). The government announced an increase of 1.4\u201312.7 per cent in minimum support prices (MSP) for kharif 2024-25 crops, ensuring a return of at least 50 per cent over the cost of production (as measured by A2 plus FL10). This adjustment aligns with the 10 A2 (out of pocket expenses) plus FL (family labour) includes all paid out costs such as expenses on hired labour, machines, rent paid for leased land, seeds, fertilisers, irrigation charges, depreciation as well as imputed value of family labour. Government\u2019s recent efforts to recalibrate MSPs in favour of oilseeds, pulses, and nutri-cereals, aiming to foster crop diversification, rectify the demand- supply disparity, and advance sustainable agricultural practices. Procurement of rice during the kharif marketing season 2023-24 (up to September 30, 2024) at 525.4 lakh tonnes was 7.7 per cent lower than in the previous year. Despite this reduction, the stock of rice held by the Food Corporation of India at 408.8 lakh tonnes as of September 16, 2024 was the highest ever held by them compared to the corresponding date in the previous years and is 3 times the quarterly buffer norms. Rice allocation under the Open Market Sales Scheme (OMSS) fell way short of the target, partly owing to subdued demand for the variety of rice offered by the corporation (Chart III.21a). In contrast, 2024-25 stood at 266.1 lakh tonnes, reflecting a 1.6 per cent increase over the previous year. The wheat stock of 246.8 lakh tonnes, however, fell short of the buffer Industrial GVA expanded by 7.4 per cent in Q1:2024- Manufacturing GVA expanded by 7.0 per cent y-o-y Mining and quarrying recorded a growth of 7.9 per cent in Q1 and 3.7 per cent in July. Manufacturing recorded an expansion of 4.1 per cent in Q1 (5.1 per cent during the previous year) and 4.6 per cent in July, while electricity registered a robust expansion of 10.8 per cent in Q1 (1.3 per cent during the previous year) and 7.9 per cent in July. While the production of basic metals, electrical equipment, motor vehicles and other transport equipment recorded an upsurge in Q1 and July, food products, textiles, and leather and related products acted as a drag on growth. In terms of the use-based classification, primary, capital, intermediate, infrastructure and consumer durables rose during Q1 and July. Consumer non-durable goods, however, registered a contraction during this period. other utility services increased at a pace of 7.2 per Electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services remained strong and posted a growth of 10.4 The index of industrial production (IIP) grew by per cent y-o-y in Q1, reflecting underlying demand conditions.

Investment activity demonstrated unseasonal rains and weather disturbances pose Q1:2024-25. Looking ahead, brighter agriculture Domestic financial markets exhibited orderly movements in contrast to volatile global market conditions during H1:2024-25. Money market rates evolved in line with liquidity shifts while long-term bond yields eased. Banks\u2019 lending and deposit rates increased, reflecting ongoing monetary policy transmission. The Reserve Bank conducted two-way market operations while ensuring adequate liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy. During H1:2024-25, financial markets global sporadically turned volatile in response to changing perceptions on the future monetary policy trajectory, sparked by data releases. Global bond yields moderated in response to the improving inflation outlook and cooling labour markets. Global equity markets gained in H1 amidst intermittent bouts of sell-offs. The US dollar traded with a weakening bias and currencies of emerging market economies (EMEs) mirrored its movements, exacerbated by swings in capital flows. Since the second half of September, however, bond yields hardened and the dollar index firmed up reversing its earlier trend (see Chapter V for details). resilient. Money market rates evolved in sync with liquidity shifts. Long-term government bond yields eased in response to domestic developments and global cues. Equity markets remained buoyant, with sporadic episodes of course corrections. The INR traded with a depreciating bias against the US dollar in H1 but remained among the least volatile major EME currencies. In the credit market, growth in bank credit outpaced deposit expansion although the wedge has narrowed more recently. During H1:2024-25, liquidity conditions transitioned to surplus from deficit in H2:2023-24 (see Section IV.3 for details). As a result, overnight money market rates softened and generally remained within In contrast to global developments, domestic financial markets remained relatively stable and In response to the changing liquidity dynamics, the Reserve Bank conducted two-way operations under the LAF to ensure that the weighted average call rate (WACR) \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 remained closely aligned with the policy repo rate. The WACR increased sharply during June 27-28 due to quarter-end liquidity tightness, also evident from a sudden spike in borrowings under the marginal standing facility (MSF). The WACR, which remained mostly above the repo rate until end-June 2024, moderated from July 2024 as liquidity conditions eased with a pick-up in government spending. At the end of H1 (September 30), however, the WACR increased by 15 bps on account of banks reducing their exposures in the uncollateralised market which incur higher Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) requirements in the ensuing quarter.1 On an average basis, the WACR remained 5 basis points (bps) above the policy repo rate during H1, as compared with 21 bps in H2:2023-24 (Chart IV.1b). Volatility in the WACR, as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV), moderated to 1.61 per cent during H1 from 1.77 per cent during H2:2023-24. Movements in overnight rates in the collateralised segment, i.e., tri-party repo (TREPS) and market repo were broadly aligned with the WACR. Money market activity was dominated by the collateralised segments, with their share in overnight money market volumes remaining unchanged at 98.0 per cent in H1 (Chart IV.2). Mutual funds (MFs) remained the major lenders in TREPS, although their share moderated to 65 per cent in H1 from 66 per cent in H2:2023-24. In the market repo segment, the share of MFs increased to 41 per cent in H1 from 33 per cent, with a concomitant decline in the share of foreign banks to 34 per cent from 43 per cent. On the borrowing side, public sector banks (PSBs) remained the dominant players in TREPS, with their share increasing to 47 per cent in H1 from 45 per cent in H2:2023-24. In market repo, however, their share reduced to 4 per cent from 9 per cent over the same period. In the longer-term segments of the money market, rates on commercial papers (CPs), certificates of deposit (CDs) and T-bills softened during H1 1 Additionally, the tightness in the overnight segment was compounded by mutual funds reducing their lending in tri-party repo due to redemption pressures. the banking system and reduced supply of shorter maturity T-bills (Chart IV.3). Rates on CPs issued (NBFCs), by non-banking however, remained elevated reflecting, inter alia, the increase in risk weights on bank lending to NBFCs announced by the Reserve Bank on November 16, 2023. The average spreads of T-bills, CDs and CPs over the MSF rate softened to zero, 49 bps and 61 bps, in H1 from 19 bps, 74 bps and 100 bps, respectively, in H2:2023-24. 4.0 lakh crore Fresh issuances of CDs moderated to in H1 from 5.5 lakh crore in H2:2023-24, mainly due to surplus liquidity conditions since July 2024. Within H1, CD issuances in the shorter tenor (up to 91-day) declined, with their share in total issuances reducing to 54 per cent in July 2024 from 84 per cent in May 2024. Concomitantly, the share of longer tenor CDs (181-365 days) increased to 45 per cent in July 2024 from 14 per cent in May 2024 (Chart IV.4). The persistent gap in credit and deposit growth prompted banks to explore alternative sources such as CDs of longer tenors to bridge the funding gap. lakh crore in H2:2023-24 (Chart IV.5a). Among fresh issuances, the average share of NBFCs increased to 32 per cent in H1 from 29 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Thus, NBFCs have resorted to greater mobilisation of resources from the market in the wake of the November 2023 measures, as mentioned earlier. In the CP market, corporates were the major players with a share of 38 per cent in Resource mobilisation through fresh issuances of 6.7 CPs increased to Outstanding (as at end-period) week of May, buoyed by positive sentiments on the inclusion of Indian G-secs in global bond indices and the buyback of government paper. Yields remained largely stable during the month of June and July, moderating towards the end of July due to market reactions to a potential increase in the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) based on the draft guidelines on LCR issued by the RBI. Yields continued to moderate in August and September on lower inflation prints (for July and August) and the start of the policy easing cycle in the US. segment had the largest share of fresh CP issuances During H1, G-sec yields softened (Chart IV.6).

The weighted average yield (WAY) on traded maturities for G-secs and T-bills declined by 23 bps and 19 bps, respectively, in H1 from that in H2:2023-24. The overall dynamics of the yield curve are captured by its latent factors viz., level, slope and curvature2. Yields have softened across the term structure as reflected in the downward shift of the yield curve during H1 (Chart IV.9a), with the average level of yields softening by 29 bps while the slope of the yield curve increased by 26 bps due to the relatively higher decline in short-term rates (Chart IV.9b). The curvature, on the other hand, increased by 18 bps, reflecting the hardening bias in the mid-segment vis-\u00e0-vis the short and long term. In the Indian context, the level and curvature of the yield curve are 2 The level is the average of par yields of all tenors up to 30-years published by FBIL and the slope (term spread) is the difference in par yields of 3-months and 30-year maturities. The curvature is calculated as twice the 15-year yield minus the sum of 30-year and 3-month yields. found to have more information content on future On a review of prevailing market conditions, of India (GoI), announced that all securities under the market borrowing programme of the GoI shall be auctioned by the multiple price auction method, effective April 1, 2024.

Nevertheless, the risk premium (the spread of 3-year AAA corporate bond yields over 3-year G-sec yields) increased from 44 bps to 71 bps for PSUs, FIs and banks; from 80 bps to 102 bps for NBFCs; and from 77 bps to 97 bps for corporates, in H1:2024-25 due to sharper decline in G-sec yields (Chart IV.11b). of comparable maturities was 31 bps in H1:2024- 25 (Chart IV.10).

Despite transient surges in volatility, Indian equity markets maintained an upward in H1:2024-25, with the BSE Sensex surpassing the historic 80,000 mark in July 2024. Amidst these gains, market valuation, as measured by the trailing price- earnings ratio of the BSE Sensex, continued to remain above its long-term average and reached 24.8 at end- September 2024. Indian equities began the financial year positively, driven by strong domestic and global macroeconomic data and robust domestic corporate earnings. Thereafter, markets declined briefly amidst rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle-East. After the initial losses in May, the market capitalisation of Indian listed companies surpassed US$ 5 trillion in the wake of positive market sentiments from improved GoI finances and other domestic and global cues. In early June, the market exhibited large swings during the announcement of Lok Sabha election results, which drove the India VIX6 to its highest levels since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war. Thereafter, markets recovered quickly amidst expectations of policy continuity, release of softer than-expected domestic as well as US inflation for May and India\u2019s current account turning into a surplus in Q4:2023-24. In July, gains in IT sector stocks and dovish signals from the US Fed propelled the Sensex past the 80,000 mark before its correction later in the month on the budgetary announcement of changes in the capital gains tax structure. 6 A measure of short-term expected volatility of Nifty 50. Indian financial markets faced a fresh bout of of portfolio flows. Thereafter, markets recovered combination of factors: (i) elevated geopolitical as expectations of a US Fed rate cut grew stronger expected economic data from the US; and (iii) the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raising rates for the second time in 17 years. The BoJ's actions prompted a sudden and imminent policy pivot. The resulting surprises on large unwinding of yen carry trade. The resulting the future path of monetary policy have a profound US equity market meltdown led to heightened Monetary policy surprises can be decomposed into \u2018target\u2019 and \u2018path\u2019 factors. The former reflects unexpected changes in the contemporaneous policy rate, while the latter represents surprises in its future trajectory. Intraday changes in 1-year MIBOR-linked OIS rates on policy announcement days are used as a measure of policy surprise (Lloyd, 2018).7 The target factor is the difference between the actual repo rate and the mean expectations of the repo rate from the Bloomberg Economists\u2019 survey (Anderson 2010). The path factor is estimated as the residual of a regression of changes in OIS rate on the target factor: is the change in 1-year OIS rates, it is the where actual repo rate, is the expected/mean repo rate in the Bloomberg survey and \u03b5t is the path factor. To minimise the impact of other significant macroeconomic events on asset prices, changes are measured over a narrow window around policy announcements (Gurkaynak et al., 2004). The estimated target and path factors on each policy announcement day around a 60-minute window for the period January 2014-August 2024 encompassing 67 policy announcement dates, including 5 unscheduled ones, are presented in Chart IV.1.1.8 To assess the relative importance of target and path factors for movements in equity prices, BSE Sensex returns over two different, but narrow, time windows are regressed on the target and path factors: where the alternative time windows (in minutes) with . The windows thus being returns on policy day \u03b4 \u2208 {30,60} constructed span 30 minutes (i.e., 10 minutes before and 20 minutes after the policy announcement) and 60 minutes (i.e., 15 minutes before and 45 minutes after) around the policy announcement. The findings indicate that Sensex returns are affected significantly by the surprise in the future path of monetary policy (path factor), and it is stronger for the 60-minute window vis-\u00e0-vis the 30 minutes window (Table IV.1.1). As expected, a positive path factor or an expected policy tightening in the future leads to negative equity returns as equity markets price in changes in longer-term borrowing costs. The results, subscript represents changes/returns in 7 Assuming that changes in the OIS rates are in response to unanticipated changes in monetary policy and that other factors such as risk premia remain constant in these intraday windows. 8 Gupta et al., (2024) conducts a similar exercise on policy dates for the period June 2018-June 2022. b) Newey-West standard errors are presented in parentheses.

(Chart IV.13a). Amid bouts of volatility, India VIX averaged higher at around 14.8 during H1:2024-25 than 13.2 during H2:2023-24 (Chart IV.13b). Overall, the BSE Sensex gained 14.5 per cent during H1:2024-25 to close at 84,300 at end-September 2024. The broader market indices continued to outperform the benchmark Sensex, with the BSE MidCap and the BSE SmallCap index increasing by 25.5 per cent and 32.4 per cent, respectively, during H1:2024-25 turning net sellers during April and May 2024. Foreign investors, however, remained overall net hand, remained robust. Overall, DIIs and FPIs were net buyers to the tune of 0.82 lakh crore, respectively, in H1 (Chart IV.14a). In terms \u20b9 of systematic investment plan (SIP) contributions through mutual funds, monthly collections crossed the 20,000 crore mark for the first time in April 2024, followed by fresh highs in each of the subsequent months in H1 (up to August 2024). Primary market resource mobilisation in equity markets was placed market, SME companies mobilised The Indian rupee (INR) traded in a range-bound manner with a depreciating bias during the first half of 2024-25 (Chart IV.15a). The US dollar remained between April and mid-July 2024 but depreciated potential rate cut by the US Fed, which was eventually corroborated by the 50 bps rate cut by the US Fed on September 18. The unwinding of yen carry trade in early-August exacerbated volatility in global financial markets, albeit briefly. Overall, the volatility of the INR \u2013 measured by the 1-month at the money (ATM) option implied volatility \u2013 fell marginally to an average but rose in Q2, particularly for longer maturities, INR depreciated by 0.5 per cent against the US dollar, although it outperformed several EME peer currencies 1-month forward premia averaged 1.18 per cent In terms of the Reserve Bank\u2019s 40-currency real cent in H2:2023-24, while the 12-month premia rose effective exchange index, the INR appreciated by 0.1 Forward premia remained stable in Q1:2024-25 A financial conditions index (FCI) is a summary measure that encapsulates the information content in a broad array of financial variables and helps to gauge the incipient stress in financial markets. Monetary policy actions impact financial conditions through channels of monetary transmission although financial conditions often change independently of policy decisions. The FCI is, thus, a valuable input for monetary policy in so far as it measures the impact of financial variables on real activity, over and above the direct effects of monetary policy (Hatzius et al., 2010). It can, therefore, serve as a guide on the effective stance of policy (Bowe et al., 2023). An FCI for India is constructed by using twenty financial market indicators at daily frequency for the period January 1, 2012 to September 30, 2024. The chosen indicators represent five market segments, namely (i) the money market; (ii) the G-sec market; (iii) the corporate bond market; (iv) the forex market; and (v) the equity market (Table IV.2.1). The money market segment includes indicators on liquidity conditions while the G-sec market segment is represented by latent factors viz., level, slope, and curvature of the sovereign yield curve. The corporate bond market segment is captured through credit risk indicators. Finally, indicators on return and volatility of currency and equities constitute the forex and equity market segments, respectively. All indicators are factored into the index in a manner such that an increase in these indicate a tightening of financial conditions. India US 10yr yield differential USD-INR 1M ATM volatility Currency return 1M forward premia India VIX PE level relative to 2yr moving average BSE Sensex return BSE Mid-Cap return BSE Small-Cap return The FCI is computed using a dynamic factor model (DFM): \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf06(\ud835\udc3f)\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf09\ud835\udc61 is the is the vector of financial indicators, where \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61 = \u03a8(\ud835\udc3f)\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61-1 + \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc61 underlying common factor representing the financial \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 are mean-zero serially and conditions index, and uncorrelated idiosyncratic errors. \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc61 The standardized FCI along with the contribution of its constituent blocks is presented in Chart IV.2.1. The estimated FCI closely tracks the evolution of financial conditions in India over the years. The peaks in FCI are associated with major events like the taper tantrum, stress in the NBFC sector during the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) episode and the COVID-19 pandemic. The major drivers of FCI, however, vary across events. While the forex market was the key factor during the taper tantrum, domestic factors were the primary drivers during the IL&FS and COVID-19 episodes. The exceptionally easy financial condition in the aftermath of the pandemic was driven by all market segments. withdrawal of accommodation. Congenial financial conditions during this period were mainly driven by stable forex market conditions and the buoyant equity market, reflecting improved global investor confidence in India\u2019s economic outlook.

(2010). Financial Conditions Indexes: A Fresh Look After the Financial Crisis. NBER Working Paper No. 16150 Growth in bank credit remained strong in H1:2024- 25, albeit with a slowing momentum. Non food bank credit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) decelerated to 14.4 per cent (y-o-y) as on September 20, 2024 from 15.3 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.18). Across bank groups, credit growth of private sector banks (PVBs) remained higher (16.4 per cent) than that of public sector banks (PSBs) (12.9 per cent), while foreign banks\u2019 credit offtake picked up pace (Chart IV.19a). PSBs continued to account for the largest share of incremental credit, although their share declined vis-\u00e0-vis PVBs and foreign banks (Chart IV.19b). From a sectoral perspective, the overall growth (y-o-y) in bank credit was primarily driven by personal loans and services, although their share in total incremental credit moderated in H1:2024-25 (up to August) vis-\u00e0- vis the same period of the previous year10. Credit growth to the agriculture sector remained in double digits. Industrial credit growth, which was tepid during H1:2023-24, recorded an uptick in H1:2024-25 (up to August). Credit to services and personal loans segments, however, moderated, reflecting the impact of the regulatory measures11 undertaken by the Reserve Bank in November 2023 (Chart IV.20a). The share of agriculture and industry in SCBs\u2019 incremental credit offtake rose to 16.1 per cent and 9 While overall bank credit and non-food credit data are based on Section-42 return (which covers all SCBs), sectoral non-food credit data are based on sector-wise and industry-wise bank credit (SIBC) return, which covers select banks accounting for about 95 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all SCBs. Data on bank credit exclude the impact of merger of a non-bank with a bank. 10 The sectoral credit growth (y-o-y) for May 2024 is based on 27 fortnights as against the usual 26 fortnights. 11 Risk weights on bank lending to NBFCs and retail loans excluding housing, education, vehicle loans, and loans against gold and gold jewellery were increased on November 16, 2023 (https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/REGULATORYMEASURES8785E7886A044B678FB8AF2C6C051807.PDF). 16.6 per cent, respectively, in August 2024 from 14.4 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively, in the previous year. In contrast, the incremental share of services and personal loans moderated over the same period (Chart IV.20b). Credit to agriculture and allied activities registered double digit growth, improving to 17.7 per cent (y-o-y) in August 2024 from 16.5 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.20a), driven by favourable monsoon and continued Credit to industry grew by 9.8 per cent in August 2024 from 5.3 per cent a year ago, primarily driven by a pickup in offtake to large industry (Chart IV.21a). Higher credit expansion in micro, small and medium industries further supported growth in this segment (Chart IV.21b). Among the major industrial sub-sectors, credit growth to chemicals and chemical products, food processing, infrastructure, and petroleum, coal products and nuclear fuels accelerated in August 2024. Credit growth to services and personal loans segments at 15.6 per cent and 16.9 per cent, respectively, in August 2024 displayed gradual moderation (Chart IV.22a and IV.23a). Within the services sector, NBFCs were the main driver of overall growth. Increasing dependency of NBFCs on bank borrowings triggered regulatory concerns. Similarly, certain components showed higher growth in the personal loans segment, which led to concerns about incipient stress. To address the build-up of any potential risk, the Reserve Bank tightened lending norms in November 2023 as alluded to earlier. Consequently, total consumer loan growth in the sub-segments where risk weights were increased, moderated to 13.9 Note: In the case of NBFCs, a few banks have reported prepayment/repayment of their advances from some HFCs/PFIs/NBFCs, which also contributed to the decline in growth.

In tandem, growth in bank credit to NBFCs moderated to 12.2 per cent, bringing down its share to 26.9 per cent of incremental credit extended to services during the same period (Chart IV.22b). The asset quality of SCBs improved during 2024- 25 (up to June 2024), with the overall gross non- performing assets (NPA) ratio declining to 2.7 per cent in June 2024 from 3.7 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.24a). Asset quality improved across all the major sectors (Chart IV.24b). Growth in non-SLR12 investments of banks (comprising investments in CPs, bonds, debentures and shares of public and private corporates) increased to 4.8 per cent in H1:2024-25 from 4.1 per cent in H2:2023-24 (Chart IV.25a). The growth in adjusted non-food credit (i.e., non-food bank credit plus non-SLR investments by banks) was marginally lower at 14.1 per cent in Q2:2024-25 as compared to 14.4 per cent in Q2:2023- 24 (Chart IV.25b). demand and time liabilities (NDTL), up from 8.6 per cent at end-September 2023 (Chart IV.26). Excess SLR holdings provide collateral buffers to banks for availing funds under the LAF as well as wholesale funding in the TREPS and market repo segments. They are also a component of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). Excess holdings of SLR securities by SCBs as on September 6, 2024 were 8.8 per cent of their net Transmission to lending and deposit rates of banks continued in H1:2024-25, with the latter adjusting faster in the wake of persistent credit demand and the widening gap between credit and deposit growth. During H1:2024-25, the median 1-year marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) of SCBs increased by 10 bps, indicating a slightly higher cost of borrowing. During April-August 2024, the weighted average lending rates (WALRs) on fresh and outstanding rupee loans increased by 4 bps and 6 bps, respectively. In the current tightening cycle, i.e., May 2022 to August 2024, in which the policy repo rate was cumulatively increased by 250 bps, the WALR of SCBs on fresh and outstanding rupee loans increased by 190 bps and 119 bps, respectively.

Banks have increased their rates on fresh retail deposits by 21 bps during the same period. The WADTDRs on fresh and outstanding rupee deposits of SCBs increased by 243 bps and 190 bps, respectively, during May 2022 to August 2024 (Table IV.4). Bank group-wise, the transmission to WALRs on fresh rupee loans of PSBs was higher than that of PVBs, while it was lower for outstanding loans (Chart IV.27a). The lending rates of PVBs remained above those of PSBs (Chart IV.27b).

As up liquidity turned into deficit since the latter half of April, five main and 17 fine-tuning variable rate repo (VRR) auctions were conducted, cumulatively injecting 15.5 lakh crore into the system to ease liquidity tightness in Q1:2024-2515. A 3-day VRR auction was conducted on June 28 (Reporting Friday) instead of the main operation as liquidity conditions were expected to improve significantly in the near term. As systemic liquidity turned into surplus at the beginning of July, the Reserve Bank switched to variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions to absorb surplus liquidity. Overall, 49 VRRR auctions \u2013 5 main and 44 fine-tuning operations of maturities ranging 1-7 days \u2013 were conducted during Q2 to absorb surplus liquidity (Chart IV.32). As liquidity turned into deficit in the latter half of September, the Reserve Bank conducted one main and 3 fine- 2.1 tuning VRR operations, cumulatively injecting lakh crore into the system during the second half of September to ease liquidity conditions. The fine-tuning VRRR auctions, on average, elicited better response from the banks than the fortnightly main operations in H1.16 Given the tepid response of 15 During this period, 3 fine-tuning VRRR operations were conducted on May 6 and June 4, cumulatively absorbing liquidity to the tune 0.7 lakh crore. 16 The average bid-offer ratio of fine-tuning auctions was 0.48 as compared to 0.17 for the fortnightly main auctions. Reserve money (Adjusted for CRR changes) accelerated to 5.7 per cent in September 2024 from 4.1 per cent at end-March 2024. Money supply (M3) growth decelerated to 10.8 per cent (y-o-y) as on September 20, 2024, from 11.2 per cent in end-March 2024 (Table IV.8). Note: Data is as on last reporting fortnight of the quarter.

As on September 20, 2024, reserve money (RM) expanded by 6.8 per cent (y-o-y) (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in CRR) as against 6.7 per cent at end-March 2024. The growth in CiC In contrast to volatile global financial markets, domestic market conditions remained stable in H1:2024-25. Money market rates evolved in tune with liquidity shifts, consistent with the monetary policy stance. Domestic long-term bond yields eased amidst an improving inflationary outlook and positive global sentiment on India\u2019s prospects. Equity market scaled new highs, mainly supported by domestic investors. The INR traded with a depreciating bias but remained among the least volatile EME currencies during H1. Monetary transmission continued with credit growth continuing to outpace deposit expansion. Going forward, the Reserve Bank will remain agile and nimble in conducting market operations to ensure financial stability while providing liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy. Global growth remains resilient. Headline inflation decelerated at a sluggish pace as sticky services prices hindered strong disinflation in goods. Most central banks tread the path of monetary policy normalisation but with measured cuts and cautious pace, while others retain their restrictive stance. Fluctuating perceptions on the monetary policy trajectory imparted volatility to global financial markets. Stubborn services inflation, high public debt, geopolitical risks, potential escalation of trade tensions, and extreme weather events pose downside risks to the global growth outlook. Global economic activity remains resilient. World trade has firmed up, propelled by strong exports from Asia. Both headline and core inflation (headline excluding food and energy) continue to decelerate, albeit at a sluggish pace, with strong disinflation in goods hindered by persistence of higher-than-average services inflation. With inflation still above target for some inflation targeting advanced economies (AEs), central banks remain cautious while unwinding their restrictive stance. Some emerging market economies (EMEs), on the other hand, that had initiated pre- emptive tightening to curb inflation persistence at elevated levels have continued to normalise their monetary policies while others retain policy rates at restrictive levels. Global financial markets remain volatile in response to fluctuating perceptions on the monetary policy trajectory and how it impacts the growth-inflation trade-off. Equity markets have broadly gained notwithstanding intermittent bouts of sharp spikes in volatility. Sovereign bond yields have softened, while the US dollar has pared strength since April 2024. Off-late, however, both sovereign bond yields and US dollar index have inched up, reversing its earlier trend. Risks to the global growth outlook remain broadly balanced. indicators for Q3:2024 point to faltering momentum in manufacturing but a durable expansion in services sector activity. In its World Economic Outlook (WEO) update of July 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) retained global growth projections at 3.2 per cent for 2024 while increasing it to 3.3 per cent for 2025.1 Amongst the AEs, the US economy grew by 3.0 per cent (quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised rates (q-o-q, saar)) in Q2:2024, faster than in Q1 (1.6 per cent) (Table V.1). This improvement was driven by consumer spending, private inventory investment, and non-residential fixed investment, while imports also increased. Labour market conditions have been easing, with the unemployment rate picking up to 4.1 per cent in September (3.8 per cent in March). The US composite Standard and Poor's (S&P) global purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) was robust at 54.0 in September 2024, though increasingly uneven as services activity exhibited solid expansion while manufacturing output declined. In 2024 so far, global economic activity has remained stable despite tight financial conditions and persistent geopolitical risks. High frequency Real GDP growth in the euro area decelerated in Q2 to 0.8 per cent (q-o-q, saar) from 1.3 per cent in Q1 due to decline in gross fixed capital formation. Labour markets remained resilient, with the unemployment rate at 6.4 per cent in August, its lowest level since the start of the euro. The Eurozone composite PMI hit a seven-month low of 49.6 in September from 1 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its Interim Economic Outlook (September 2024) revised up global growth forecast for 2024 by 10 bps to 3.2 per cent from May 2024 projections and retained it at 3.2 per cent for 2025. Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted, annualised rate (q-o-q, saar) slower upturns reflected in both the sectors. Japan\u2019s GDP rebounded strongly and grew by 2.9 per cent in Q2:2024 (q-o-q, saar) vis-\u00e0-vis a contraction of 2.4 per cent in Q1, driven by robust private consumption and capital expenditure. The composite PMI (au Jibun Bank) remained elevated at 52.0 in September following a 15-month high of 52.9 in August, driven by resilient services activity. Amongst EMEs, China\u2019s real GDP moderated to 4.7 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2024 from 5.3 per cent in Q1, amidst continued downturn in the real estate sector and tepid consumer demand. Secondary and tertiary industries also witnessed a slowdown in the second quarter. Nonetheless, the economy grew by 5.0 per cent in the first half of 2024 \u2013 propelled by monetary easing and regulatory relaxations for the real estate sector \u2013 meeting the official target of 5.0 per cent for 2024 so far. The composite PMI (Caixin) posted 50.3 in September, down from 51.2 in August due to slower expansions in both manufacturing and services sectors. P: Projection.

GDP growth in the UK, despite moderating from 2.8 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q1:2024, remained resilient at 1.8 per cent in Q2 supported by increases in gross capital formation, government consumption and household spending. The unemployment rate increased to 4.3 per cent in April-July 2024 from the average of 4.0 per cent in 2023. The UK composite PMI posted 52.6 in September, down from 53.8 in August with Among other major EMEs, Brazil\u2019s GDP growth accelerated to 3.3 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2024 vis-\u00e0- vis 2.5 per cent in Q1, driven by expansion in the services and industrial sectors. The labour market, however, remained tight as the unemployment rate continued to decline to 6.6 per cent in August 2024, its lowest level since 2014. The composite PMI was up from an eight-month low of 52.9 in August to 55.2 in September due to quicker upturn in services activity and a renewed expansion in factory production. The South African economy grew at a tardy pace of 0.3 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2024 (0.5 per cent in Q1) as financial industry expansion was offset by the decline in the transport, storage and communication industry. The composite PMI for South Africa rose from 50.5 in August to 51.0 in September signalling improved demand conditions. The Russian economy grew by 4.1 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2024 (5.4 per cent in Q1), partly driven by higher military and defence spending. The composite PMI, however, posted 49.4 in September, down from 52.1 in August. The ASEAN2 economies recorded resilient growth in Q2:2024 amidst higher new orders and increased activity. Southeast Asian economies are projected to grow at a robust pace3, driven by improved domestic and external demand conditions, stable prices, and increased tourism-related activities. In Q3:2024 so far, growth has decelerated marginally but remains healthy due to positive sentiments on future output amidst persistent price pressures. Among the BRICS economies barring South Africa, GDP growth for 2024 is projected to moderate marginally (Table V.2). The inflation scenario in these countries is expected to improve in 2024 for all, barring Russia where inflation has risen due to demand-supply imbalance. China is facing weak rise in prices amidst a property slump and subdued consumer confidence. Turning to high frequency indicators, the OECD composite leading indicators (CLIs) for September 2024 showed that most economies remained above the long-term trend (Chart V.1a). The global composite PMI remained in expansion zone for the eleventh consecutive month in September at 52.0 as strong expansion in the services sector offset weakness in manufacturing (Chart V.1b). The global manufacturing PMI, however, plunged to an eleven-month low of 48.8 in September as output, new orders and employment contracted. Global merchandise trade volume grew for the fourth consecutive month in July 2024, recording an expansion of 1.7 per cent (y-o-y). EMEs remained the major driver for the sixth consecutive quarter in Q2:2024, while trade volume continued to contract in AEs (Chart V.2a).

The Freightos Baltic Global Index \u2013 the global ocean freight container pricing index that measures 40-feet container prices \u2013 remained elevated on y-o-y basis in September 2024 as attacks on commercial shipping continued in the Red Sea trade route (Chart V.2b). These attacks necessitated rerouting of maritime trade from the Suez Canal to around the Cape of Good Hope, leading to longer transit time, rise in freight costs and an uptick in war-risk premia. In September, however, the Freightos Baltic Global Index fell on m-o-m basis as demand moderated. Global trade value continued to expand in Q1:2024, with around 1 per cent growth in merchandise trade (q-o-q) on the back of higher exports from China, India, and the US.4 Trade in green energy and Artificial Intelligence related products increased strongly in Q1. The latest WTO trade barometer (September 2024) indicates that global merchandise trade volume continued to grow in Q3:2024. The global trade outlook for 2024 remains positive; however, persistent geopolitical tensions, rising shipping costs and emerging industrial policies could impact trade patterns. According to the IMF's WEO update of July 2024, global trade volume is estimated to grow by 3.1 per cent and 3.4 per cent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, with faster expansion in trade in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). end of the month and early June due to a significant drop in crude oil prices. Prices softened by 0.6 per cent (q-o-q) in Q3 due to moderating energy and metal prices amidst weak demand from China (Chart V.3a). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global food prices edged up by 2.0 per cent (q-o-q) in Q2 and by 1.4 per cent in Q3, primarily due to increase in the prices of vegetable oil, dairy and meat, though partly offset by decline in sugar and cereals prices (Chart V.3b). In Q2:2024, global commodity prices as measured by the Bloomberg commodity price index remained volatile but maintained the levels attained in Q1. Gains recorded in May were corrected towards the Crude oil prices have moderated since the April 2024 MPR. Brent prices hovered above US$ 90 per barrel in the first half of April following heightened geopolitical tensions, but corrected over the rest of the period in Q2 (till early June) in the wake of weak demand and increased oil inventories. Crude oil prices fell to a low of US$ 76 per barrel in early June after the meeting of OPEC+, wherein eight members agreed to reverse some \u201cvoluntary\u201d cuts from October 2024.5 Thereafter, with escalation of geopolitical tensions and larger than expected decline in US crude oil inventory, prices rose for a short while before again moderating in July over demand concerns, fuelled by lower-than- expected Chinese GDP growth and signs of cooling US labour market. Crude prices firmed up in August with tensions escalating in the Middle East, however, it began to soften in early September, prompting the postponement of the scheduled unwinding of the \u201cvoluntary\u201d production cuts by eight OPEC+ members from October to December 2024. Notwithstanding the announcement, prices dropped below $70 per barrel on September 10 \u2013 the first time since December 2021 \u2013 but recouped some losses thereafter. Natural gas prices (according to the World Bank\u2019s natural gas index) increased in Q2 and Q3 due to unplanned outages in Europe and increased demand for power generation in the US (Chart V.3c). record highs buoyed by improved odds of the US Fed\u2019s rate cut, renewed weakening of the US dollar and safe haven flight (Chart V.3d). Consumer price inflation grudgingly eased further as sticky services prices posed a drag on the pace of disinflation. Nonetheless, inflation is already close to pre-pandemic levels for the median EMDEs owing to declining energy prices.6 Stronger nominal wage growth in some countries and escalating Base metal prices peaked in May, fuelled by economic stimulus undertaken by China, the largest consumer of base metals, but corrected later over a muted demand outlook. Overall, the prices of most base metals firmed up in Q2 and continued to rise in Q3 as positive sentiments from Chinese stimulus measures overwhelmed negative sentiments emanating from muted demand outlook. Gold prices (q-o-q) rallied in Q2 and Q3 by 5.5 per cent and 13.9 per cent, respectively, with prices surpassing their record highs in every successive month. Yellow metal prices surged in April over a potential escalation in geopolitical tensions that triggered safe-haven demand. Prices moderated briefly as tensions eased but firmed up again in May above April levels due to weakening US dollar and softening treasury yields. Prices corrected in late May and June over weak seasonal demand and a stronger US dollar, but rebounded in Q3 to touch P: Projection. Notes: 1.

The same were announced to be unwound gradually over the following 12 months beginning in October. However, besides unwinding of these \u201cvoluntary\u201d cuts, OPEC+ also announced extension of deep cuts in oil production to support prices till the end of 2025. 6 As per IMF's WEO Update released on July 16, 2024. trade tensions pose upside risks to the disinflation momentum, causing monetary policy to remain restrictive. Notwithstanding the decline, inflation still ranges above the target in some inflation-targeting economies. According to the IMF's WEO Update, July 2024, global inflation is projected to fall from 6.7 per cent in 2023 to 5.9 per cent in 2024 and further to 4.4 per cent in 2025 (Table V.3). In the US, headline and core CPI inflation (y-o-y) decelerated from 3.5 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively, in March 2024 to 2.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively, in August. Inflation, in terms of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index \u2013 the Fed\u2019s preferred measure \u2013 softened at a tardy pace from 2.8 per cent in March to 2.2 per cent in August (Chart V.4a), while core PCE inflation eased In the Euro area, CPI inflation moderated from 2.4 per cent in April to 1.8 per cent in September. Core inflation (inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco) remained stable at 2.7 per cent in September (same as in April), with a mild uptick during May- August. In the UK, CPI headline inflation decelerated sharply by 100 bps from 3.2 per cent in March to 2.2 per cent in August, with core inflation declining from 4.2 per cent to 3.6 per cent. In Japan, CPI inflation (all items less fresh food), the Bank of Japan (BoJ)\u2019s inflation target metric, eased briefly during March and April but started firming up since May. In August, inflation at 2.8 per cent was well above the BoJ\u2019s target of 2 per cent. Core inflation (inflation excluding both Notes: 1. For India, core CPI, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups 'food and beverages' and 'fuel and light' from the headline CPI. fresh food and energy), however, declined to 2.0 per cent in August from 2.4 per cent in April. Amongst major EMEs, CPI inflation edged up in Brazil to 4.2 per cent in August from 3.9 per cent in March 2024 (Chart V.4c). In Russia, it accelerated from 7.7 per cent to 9.1 per cent over the same period due to western sanctions and an overheating economy. In South Africa, however, CPI inflation receded to 4.4 per cent in August from 5.3 per cent in March. China recorded positive inflation during March (0.1 per cent) to August (0.6 per cent) after it exited deflation in February. Similar to AEs, core inflation is also receding, albeit grudgingly in EMEs (Chart V.4d). Following and highly synchronised monetary policy tightening to counter multi-decadal high inflation in 2022-23, the strength and credibility of central bank policies were tested as they tried to curb inflation without hampering growth, necessitating a revamp of the monetary policy operating frameworks of some countries in the context of changing dynamics of policy trade-offs (Box V.1). In 2024, particularly during Q2 and Q3, monetary policy cycles diverged as central banks across AEs and EMEs responded to their own evolving growth-inflation dynamics. While continuing to emphasise on caution While successfully navigating through the two black swan events of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Europe, central banks worldwide had to quickly change gears from providing large-scale stimulus that resuscitated economic activity to battling decadal-high inflation to restore price stability. This prompted central banks to undertake synchronised and aggressive interest rate hikes in decades accompanied by ultra-hawkish stances even as they started to taper their bloated balance sheets. to the ECB, the RBA also planned to shift from a system of excess to ample reserves in April 2024 (Kent, 2024). According to the RBA, the move towards ample reserves, that lies somewhere between the current \u2018floor\u2019 system with excess reserves and the pre-pandemic \u2018corridor\u2019 system with scarce reserves, eliminates (i) the need for precise estimation of demand for reserves; (ii) minimises risk of volatile money markets; and (iii) is more resilient to future balance sheet expansions during periods of financial stress. Monetary policy operating frameworks underwent significant refinements in two major systemic countries \u2013 the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The ECB, faced with mounting post-pandemic the inflation pressures, imperative of moving from abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity. In response, it announced a new operational framework effective September 2024, wherein the main refinancing operations (MRO) rate is adjusted and anchored at 15 bps (as opposed to 50 bps earlier) above the deposit facility rate (DFR) while the rate on marginal lending facility (MLF) remains at 25 bps above the MRO rate (EP, 2024). This adjustment would retain the asymmetric corridor but narrow the corridor width to 40 bps from 75 bps, which would deter upward deviations and contain volatility as rate gets anchored closer to the DFR (Chart V.1.1) (ECB, 2024).7 Analogous recognised There are also instances of countries shifting to simpler mandates for monetary policy for better management of trade-offs. In February 2024, the RBA announced a switch towards a dual mandate of price stability and full employment with the clarification that, in practice, the dual mandate is not a substantial departure from the status quo (PoA, 2024). In this regard, the deleted \u2018third goal\u2019 of contributing to Australian people\u2019s economic prosperity and welfare will henceforth be an \u201coverarching objective\u201d, rather than a policy objective for monetary policy. On a similar but more focussed move, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) highlighted the necessity for a more precise and focused monetary policy target in June 2023. Recognising that the shift to a dual mandate in 2018 was a mistake, it recommended a shift back to the single mandate in order to remain focussed on price stability 7 Additionally, two new instruments \u2013 a structural portfolio of assets and long-term refinancing operations \u2013 will be introduced going forward for ECB. and enhance its policy credibility. The RBNZ amended the Remit for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in December 2023, recommending that the MPC remain solely focussed on achieving an inflation target of 1-3 per cent over the medium-term, with added emphasis on the 2 per cent mid-point (RBNZ, 2023). decades, despite undertaking surge in inflation led to a rise in inflation expectations and, therefore, the BoJ made a pivotal decision to exit its negative interest rate policy in March 2024, discontinuing In the case of Japan, the pandemic served as a catalyst to emerge from the deflationary environment of several QQE with YCC (Chart V.1.2) (Kazuo, 2024). It removed the long-standing target of controlling the 10-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) rate and started targeting the uncollateralised overnight call rate. It also embarked on As countries prioritise inflation control, the role of central prominence. With a view towards enhancing transparency and ensuring effective policy communication, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced changes in its monetary policy operating framework in June 2024 and placed greater emphasis on price-based regulatory measures involving interest rates (Gongsheng, 2024). The PBoC indicated that the seven-day reverse repo rate will and consequentially, the roles of other rates on monetary policy instruments with different tenures may soften. It also pointed out that the existing corridor of the standing lending facility (SLF) acting as the ceiling and the rate on excess reserves (ERR) being the floor is relatively wide and may be narrowed, going forward. PBOC announced a new cash management tool of temporary overnight repo (ORR) and reverse repo operations (ORRR), with the interest rates fixed at the seven-day repo rate minus 20 bps and plus 50 bps, respectively (Chart V.1.3). The PBoC also intends to expand its policy toolkit by including the purchase and sale of China government bonds in the secondary market. Going ahead, the changes in the framework will be tested and reviewed in response to evolving macro-economic developments. be the central bank\u2019s main short-term operational rate and data dependence for future decisions, central banks of major systemic AEs embarked on policy pivots even as some others have paused. Given their pre-emptive tightening at the onset of the inflation surge, some EME central banks continued with policy normalisation while few others continued with the restrictive stance. The US Fed initiated a pause in policy tightening in September 2023 and continued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25-5.50 per cent in all its subsequent meetings. In September 2024, however, it lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 bps to 4.75-5.00 per cent (Chart V.5a). As per the Summary of Economic Projections released in the September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants expected the target range for the federal fund rates to be at 4.25-4.50 per cent by end 2024 and at 3.25-3.50 per cent by end 2025, indicating a further 50 bps rate cut in the remaining part of 2024 and 100 bps rate cut in 2025. The Fed also continued with its balance sheet normalisation policy. by 25 bps in June 2024, marking its first cut in the current easing cycle. It again announced a cut in its deposit facility rate (DFR) by 25 bps in September after keeping it unchanged in July. It reiterated that it would continue to remain data-dependant to determine the appropriate level and duration of restriction. Besides, (APP) portfolio continues to shrink as principal payments from maturing securities are no longer reinvested. The Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) portfolio is also set to decline by \u20ac7.5 billion per month, on average, with reinvestments ceasing entirely by the end of 2024. The Bank of England (BoE) continued with its status quo stance initiated in September 2023, followed by first cut of 25 bps in August as inflation risks abated, but paused in its September meeting. The BoE indicated that a gradual approach in removing policy restraint is warranted, emphasising that monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks for inflation to return sustainably to the 2 per cent target dissipate further. After continuing with the pause that ECB initiated in October 2023, it lowered its three key interest rates 8 The Bank of Iceland cut its policy rate by 25 bps on October 02, 2024. the Bank of Korea maintained status quo in all their meetings during Q2 and Q3 of 2024. After keeping its policy rate unchanged since September 2023, the Bank of Canada reduced it by 25 bps each in all its meetings starting June 2024. The RBNZ cut its official cash rate by 25 bps in August 2024, following a pause since July 2023. The Sveriges Riksbank slashed its policy rate by 25 bps each in May, August and September 2024 meetings, with a pause in the month of June. The Swiss National Bank also lowered its policy rate by 25 bps in its June and September meetings. The Czech National Bank reduced its key rate by 50 bps each in both May and June meetings and by 25 bps in its August and September meetings. In contrast, the BoJ raised its key rate by 15 bps in July, following a period of status quo in April and June. Moreover, the BoJ announced its plan to taper its outright purchase of JGBs at a predictable pace of 400 billion yen each quarter, reaching around 3 trillion yen by January- March 2026. The BoJ, however, maintained status quo in its September meeting. In the BRICS economies, the Banco Central do Brasil, continued to maintain its accommodative stance that started in August 2023 by cutting its Selic rate by 25 bps in May 2024, but paused thereafter in the months of June and July. In September, however, it pivoted by raising the Selic rate by 25 bps due to emerging upside risks to inflation. The South African Reserve Bank cut its repo rate by 25 bps in September 2024 for the first time after keeping it unchanged in May and July meetings. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) reduced the one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) by 10 bps in July after keeping it unchanged in Q2:2024. It reduced the one-year Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) rate by 20 bps in July and 30 bps in September. In September, it also announced a slew of stimulus measures to support the economy, recoup the housing sector and restore market confidence including reduction in reserve requirement ratio by 50 bps and seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 bps to 1.5 per cent. The Bank of Russia (BoR) maintained status quo in Q2:2024 but increased its policy rate by 200 bps and 100 bps in July and September, respectively, of 2024 as inflation remained elevated much above the target. Among Asian EMEs, the Bank of Thailand kept its benchmark rate unchanged in Q2 and Q3 of 2024. The Bank Indonesia cut its key rate by 25 bps in September 2024 following a hike in April while pausing in intermittent meetings, while the central bank of Philippines cut its policy rate by 25 bps in August 2024 after maintaining status quo in Q2. In Latin America, the central bank of Mexico maintained the policy rate in Q2 but announced two consecutive rate cuts of 25 bps each in August and September after the first rate cut in March 2024. The central bank of Colombia continued with monetary policy easing by paring its benchmark rate by 50 bps in each of its April, June, July and September meetings. Chile cumulatively lowered its policy rate by 175 bps to 5.50 per cent during April-September 2024 with an intermittent pause in July. Peru cut its reference rate by 25 bps each in April, May, August and September meetings but maintained status quo in its June and July meetings. Among European EMEs, Hungary lowered its policy rate by 50 bps each in its April and May meetings and by 25 bps in June, July and September while maintaining a pause in August. Poland maintained a pause in Q2 and Q3 of 2024 (Chart V.5b). Global financial markets remained in a state of flux during Q2 and Q3, responding somewhat unexpectedly to changing perceptions on the monetary policy trajectory and data releases.9 Markets turned buoyant during May-September 2024 as expectation of rate 9 Bauer, M.D., C.E. Pflueger, and A. Sundaram (2024), \u201cChanging Perceptions and Post-Pandemic Monetary Policy,\u201d unpublished manuscript, FRBKC Jackson Hole conference. cuts gained momentum. Notwithstanding the gains, equity markets retreated intermittently since the last MPR \u2013 in April over continued restrictive monetary policy; in the beginning of August over a confluence of factors, including underwhelming data releases for the US and landmark rate hike by Japan; and in early September over increased risk-off sentiment amidst data releases. Overall, bond yields have moderated since the last MPR while the US dollar has pared gains. Consequently, EME currencies broadly appreciated in Q3:2024. Equity markets, in terms of the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) world index, gained 8.7 per cent since end-March, reflecting gains in both AEs and EMEs, with recurrent episodes of volatility (Chart V.6a). Among AEs, the US S&P 500 shed gains in April as strong consumer demand and high PCE inflation rekindled concerns about \u2018higher for longer\u2019 interest rates. It, however, rallied starting end-April till mid- July amidst easing geopolitical tensions and increased expectations of a rate cut over moderating inflation prints. Thereafter, market sentiment turned sour with incoming data sparking recessionary fears in the US on top of disorderly unwinding of yen carry trade consequent to the BoJ\u2019s rate hike. After undergoing a sharp dip in late July and early August, US stock markets rebounded in August as investors moved back to riskier assets on dovish guidance from the BoJ and abatement of recessionary fears. In the first week of September, however, market underwent another correction upon the release of below expectations PMI data and labour market indicators but soon rallied overhauling the previous loss. Overall, the US S&P index rose by 9.7 per cent during April-September 2024. European stocks underperformed as bullish sentiments in other markets attracted investors interest. The UK\u2019s stock indices modestly tracked the US markets in Q2, performing well following the Labour party\u2019s landslide electoral performance but relatively underperformed in Q3. The Japanese market reflected domestic factors exhibiting a sharp correction post the BoJ\u2019s rate hike causing yen appreciation and raising risks on exporters\u2019 earnings\u2019 outlook. EME equities gained since end-March, tracking global cues and lower domestic inflation prints (Chart V.6b). Chinese stocks, that were losing ground amidst flagging economic activity and the persistent downturn in real estate, rebounded sharply In tandem with Q1:2024, sovereign bond yields across major AEs continued to harden in April in response to expectations of a firmer future path of interest rates, sensitivity to rising fiscal risks and tight liquidity conditions. Beginning May, however, yields softened as incoming data signaled an improving inflation outlook for the US, raising the odds for an imminent rate cut. Illustratively, the US 10-year treasury yield rose by 48 bps in April but shed 78 bps between May-August over evolving perceptions of rate cuts. Subsequently, yields fell precipitously in August and early September, remaining below the 4 per cent mark in response to the release of underwhelming high- frequency indicators. Since mid-September, however, yields hardened as market expectations of the Federal Reserve rate cut for November shifted from 50 bps to 25 bps. Also, the yield curve inversion i.e. negative 10- minus 2-year spread that had persisted since July 2022, has reversed to become positive in September 2024. The UK 10-year bond yield broadly tracked the US market while the German 10-year yield softened in response to the ECB\u2019s rate cut actions and forward guidance. Yield on 10-year JGBs rose by 33 bps between April and July, pushed up by the BoJ\u2019s policy rate hike, including tapering of their bond purchase programme, but softened by 20 bps since August on a dovish stance (Chart V.7a). Bond yields in several EMEs exhibited a softening bias, driven by easing of domestic financial conditions as well as global cues (Chart V.7b). Bond yields in Brazil, however, hardened till July as investors trimmed their portfolios but remained volatile thereafter. In the currency markets, the US dollar remained range bound in Q2:2024, with an upward bias over changing bouts of optimism about policy easing and intermittent escalation of geopolitical and electoral risks increasing safe haven demand. Cooling labour market conditions, easing inflation and flagging high- frequency indicators of economic growth, however, led to a policy pivot by the Fed, causing a depreciation of the US dollar in Q3:2024 (Chart V.8a). However, in late September the dollar index, changed its course upon the release of better-than-expected labour market data. These movements were mirrored in the EME currencies, exacerbated by swings in capital flows (Chart V.8b). The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index remained rangebound in Q2:2024 but rose by Global growth remains resilient though flaring geopolitical tensions, flagging recovery in China, and extreme weather events pose downside risks to the outlook. Inflation remains vulnerable to in services disinflation, easing weak progress financial conditions, high public debt, strong wage growth, potential escalation of trade tensions and geoeconomic fragmentation. Even as most nations tread the path of policy normalisation, they remain cautious on rate cuts and the level of restrictiveness. Greater uncertainty about the evolving policy path is reflected in financial markets, which are buoyant yet volatile, reacting sharply to policy changes and economic data releases. Although prospects for EMEs are improving, they remain susceptible to external geopolitical risks and evolving financial conditions in advanced economies. ", "file2": "Box III.1: Consumption Switching? Unravelling the Drivers behind Changing Consumption Patterns in India The outlook for domestic economic activity remains resilient buoyed by strong consumption and investment activities. Geopolitical conflicts, uncertain global outlook, volatile global financial markets amidst changing perceptions on monetary policy trajectories, and climate shocks are the key risks to the outlook. Monetary policy remains steadfast on aligning inflation with the target on a durable basis, setting strong foundations for a sustained period of high growth. Since the release of the April 2024 Monetary Policy Report (MPR), global economic activity has shown resilience in the face of continuing geopolitical tensions and intermittent financial market volatility. Disinflation in headline inflation has been slow due to stubborn services inflation which is keeping core inflation (i.e., CPI inflation excluding food & fuel) elevated, relative to the headline. Several central banks have started easing monetary policy while others have maintained a restrictive stance, leading to divergence in policy pathways. Financial markets have been on edge, with incoming data shifting expectations about the direction of monetary policy. Sovereign bond yields have trended downwards on anticipation of policy pivots. Global equity markets have exhibited resilience, recovering quickly and regaining risk-taking appetite in spite of stretched valuations and still high leverage. Capital flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) have resumed albeit amidst heightened volatility. The US dollar index peaked in mid-June and receded thereafter on signs of cooling labour market conditions and easing inflation. Supply chain pressures have inched up since May driven by conflicts in the Middle East. Global commodity prices declined on the back of softening prices of base metals, agricultural products, and energy, however, price pressures have increased recently amidst heightened geopolitical tensions. Brent crude oil prices, that were hovering around US dollar (US$) 90 per barrel in April 2024, have since declined \u2013 even dipping below US$ 70 briefly \u2013 due to slowdown in demand and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plus\u2019 intent to gradually restore supplies. Of late, the US dollar index, sovereign bond yields and crude oil prices have inched up. International prices of most agricultural commodities have risen due to increase in prices of vegetable oil, dairy and meat. Turning to the domestic economy, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.7 per cent in Q1:2024-25 as per the National Statistical Office (NSO). Private consumption expenditure registered a growth of 7.4 per cent, contributing 63 per cent to overall GDP growth. Consumption spending has been robust in Q1:2024-25, supported by rural demand which is expected to improve further on the back of favourable monsoon, higher sowing activity and moderating inflation. Investment activity also maintained its momentum in Q1, supported by high capacity utilisation, continued buoyancy in steel consumption and capital goods imports. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) expanded by 6.8 per cent in Q1, with industry and services sectors being the key drivers. Headline consumer price inflation moderated to 4.4 per cent in April-August 2024 from 5.2 per cent in H2:2023-24. Base effects continue to have an outsized role in monthly inflation prints. Consequently, the moderation in headline inflation has been uneven. Core inflation was on a steadily declining path\u2013 in May 2024, it fell to its lowest level of 3.1 per cent in the current series (since January 2012) before increasing in July-August. Food price inflation, on the other hand, remained elevated, averaging 6.9 per cent over the last five months (April-August 2024), and contributing 72.5 per cent of headline inflation during the period. Recognising the risks from volatile and elevated food prices and its likely adverse impact on inflation expectations and spillovers to core inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent through H1 and remained resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation with the target, while supporting growth. When the MPC met in April 2024, global economy was showing resilience and inflation was trending down. Financial markets were responding to the timing and pace of monetary policy trajectories, with heightened uncertainty pushing up gold prices on safe haven demand. The domestic economic momentum appeared strong, supported by healthy bank and corporate sector balance sheets and upbeat business and consumer sentiments. Hence, the real GDP growth projection for 2024-25 was retained at 7 per cent. CPI headline inflation had softened in January- February 2024 from its December high although food inflation edged up. The MPC noted the uncertainties around the inflation trajectory stemming from weather-driven food price shocks, cost push pressures, firming crude oil prices due to geopolitical tensions and volatility in financial markets, and retained the projection of CPI inflation for 2024-25 at 4.5 per cent. The MPC observed that food price pressures have been interrupting the ongoing disinflation process, posing challenges for the final descent of inflation to the target. Considering that the path of disinflation has to be sustained till inflation reaches the 4 per cent target on a durable basis, MPC also decided, by a 5-1 majority, to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent. The MPC decided by a majority of 5-1 to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation so as to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. At the time of June 2024 meeting, global growth was sustaining momentum. Central banks remained steadfast and data-dependent in their fight against inflation, acknowledging that the final leg of disinflation might be tough. High frequency indicators for domestic economic activity showed resilience, with expectations of above normal monsoon brightening the prospects of agriculture sector and rural demand. Investment demand in the private sector was buoyed by high capacity utilisation and healthy balance sheet of banks and corporates while improving world trade was expected to support external demand. The projection of real GDP growth for 2024-25 was revised upwards by 20 basis points from the previous meeting to 7.2 per cent. In India, headline CPI inflation moderated for three successive months to 4.8 per cent in April 2024. Food inflation was persistently high while core inflation had fallen to historic lows. Nevertheless, the future inflation trajectory remained uncertain due to supply shocks, input cost pressures and crude oil price volatility. The projection of CPI inflation for 2024-25 was retained at 4.5 per cent. The MPC noted that while the growth-inflation balance had moved favourably since its previous meeting, risks to inflation remain from recurring food price shocks and monetary policy has to stay watchful of the spillovers of food price pressures to core inflation and inflation expectations. Accordingly, the MPC decided by a majority of 4-2 to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent. The MPC voted with a 4-2 majority to continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. In the run up to August 2024 meeting, headline inflation, after remaining steady at 4.8 per cent during April and May 2024, increased to 5.1 per cent in June 2024, primarily driven by the food component even though fuel prices remained in deflation and core inflation touched new lows. Assuming a normal monsoon, CPI inflation projection for 2024- 25 was retained at 4.5 per cent. Domestic economic activity was strengthening, with the pick-up in southwest monsoon rainfall and improved spatial spread translating into higher kharif sowing. Other high frequency indicators suggested expansion in services activity. A revival in private consumption has been underway with rural demand catching up with urban consumption. The pickup in investment activity gathered strength as reflected by expansion in steel consumption, high capacity utilisation and the government\u2019s thrust on infra-spending. The projection of real GDP growth for 2024-25 was retained at 7.2 per cent. The MPC observed that risks from volatile and elevated food prices remain high, which may adversely impact inflation expectations and result in spillovers to core inflation. Accordingly, the MPC decided by a majority of 4-2 to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent while retaining the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. The MPC\u2019s voting pattern reflects the diversity in individual members\u2019 assessments, expectations and policy preferences - a characteristic also reflected in voting patterns of other central banks (Table I.1). With the emerging view that the disinflation process is in its final leg, a larger number of central banks have begun an easing cycle while others have retained policy rates at restrictive levels. EME central banks that began policy rate easing have undertaken larger cuts since April 2024 while two major advanced economies (AEs) the US and the United Kingdom - have begun their policy pivot in the second half of 2024. Chapters analyse macroeconomic developments relating to inflation and economic activity during H1:2024-25 (April-September 2024). Turning to the baseline assumptions, international crude prices exhibited sizeable two-way movements in H1, receding from their five-month peak of US$ dollar (US$) 91 per barrel in early April 2024 to US$ 77 per barrel by early June 2024 on slowing demand in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and easing supply conditions. In September 2024, they were settling around US$ 71-78 per barrel. While global growth uncertainties on the demand side and geopolitical tensions on the supply side impart significant volatility to the outlook (Charts I.1a and I.1b), easing Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. global demand-supply refinery divergences have reduced the wedge between global petroleum product prices and crude prices (Chart I.1c). Considering these factors, crude prices (Indian basket) are assumed at US$ 80 per barrel in the baseline as compared with US$ 85 in the April 2024 MPR (Table I.2). Second, the nominal exchange rate of the Indian rupee (\u20b9) saw two-way movements in the range of \u20b983-84 per US$ in H1, with a depreciating bias since July 2024. Taking into consideration the uncertainty around US dollar movements, the ebbs and flows of global capital flows and international crude oil prices, the exchange rate is assumed at INR 83.5 per US dollar in the baseline as against INR 83 in the April 2024 MPR. forecast for 2025 to 3.3 per cent in its July World Economic Outlook (WEO) compared with April 2024 update. With modest recovery on the global front, the projection for global growth in 2024 and 2025 is still below the historical annual average1 of 3.8 per cent. Inflation is projected to fall from 5.9 per cent in 2024 to 4.4 per cent in 2025. The pace of decline in inflation to targets, however, is likely to be faster in Third, repeated geopolitical tensions, rekindled fears of a potential recession in key economies and financial market volatility in response to monetary policy divergence weigh heavily on global growth prospects. The global composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) has exhibited moderation since May 2024 with PMI manufacturing in contraction zone since July 2024. The IMF retained the global growth estimate for 2024 at 3.2 per cent and revised upwards its growth AEs vis-\u00e0-vis EMEs (Chart I.2). Global trade growth is estimated to rebound to 3.1 per cent in 2024 from 0.8 per cent in 2023, notwithstanding the surge in cross- border trade restrictions that pose risks to the global trade outlook. In H1:2024-25 (up to August), headline inflation remained within the tolerance band while food inflation remained elevated and persistent (Chapter II). In the September 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey2, the three months and one year ahead median inflation expectations of urban households reduced by 20 and 10 bps to 9.2 per cent and 10.0 per cent, respectively, vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate declined for both horizons vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round (Chart I.3). Manufacturing firms polled in the July - September 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expect pressures from cost of raw materials to continue, with some softening and selling price growth momentum to continue in Q3:2024-25 (Chart I.4a).3 Services sector companies and infrastructure firms expect input cost pressures to persist and selling prices growth to moderate in Q3:2024-25 (Charts I.4b and I.4c).4 In the PMI surveys for September Note: Net response is the difference between the share of respondents reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism. The range is -100 to 100. A positive/ negative value of net response is considered as optimistic/pessimistic from the view point of respondent firms. Therefore, higher positive values of selling prices indicate increase in output prices while lower values for the cost of raw materials/cost of inputs indicate higher input price pressures and vice versa.

Nevertheless, rising global supply chain pressures, adverse weather events, Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in September 2024 expect headline CPI inflation to increase from 4.0 per cent in Q2:2024-25 to 4.6 per cent in Q3, 4.4 per cent in Q4 and 4.2-4.5 per cent in H1:2025-26 (Chart I.5a and Table I.3).5 Core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and beverages, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, and fuel and light) is expected to successively increase from 3.5 per cent in Q2:2024- 25 to 3.9 per cent in Q3 and is expected to remain between 4.2-4.3 per cent in the next three quarters.In the September 2024 round, their 5-year ahead expected inflation remained unchanged at 4.5 per cent, while their 10-year ahead expectations moderated to 4.3 per cent as compared to 4.5 per cent in the previous round (Chart I.5b). Credit growth of scheduled commercial banks Combined gross fiscal deficit (per cent of GDP) Looking ahead, evolving food inflation dynamics will impinge upon the outlook for inflation.

The downside risks could materialise from an early resolution of geopolitical conflicts; weakening of global demand accompanied by further easing of global food and commodity prices; improvement in supply conditions; and proactive supply side measures by the government.

Source: RBI staff estimates. volatile food prices and continuing geopolitical strife remain key risks. Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from time-series and structural models6, CPI inflation is projected to average 4.5 per cent in 2024-25 \u2013 4.1 per cent in Q2, 4.8 per cent in Q3 and 4.2 per cent in Q4, with risks evenly balanced (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2024- 25 are 3.2-5.2 per cent and 2.6-5.8 per cent, respectively. For 2025-26, assuming a normal monsoon, and no further exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will average 4.1 per cent with 4.3 per cent in Q1, 3.7 per cent in Q2, 4.2 per cent in Q3 and 4.1 per cent in Q4. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2025-26 are 2.8-5.4 per cent and 2.1-6.1 per cent, respectively. The baseline forecasts are subject to several upside and downside risks. The upside risks emanate from Domestic economic activity resilient. Improved performance of industrial sector, upturn in investment activity, above normal monsoon, pick up in rural demand, high capacity utilisation, healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, and the government\u2019s continued thrust on infrastructure spending augur well for the growth outlook. Uncertain lingering global economic outlook, geopolitical conflicts, rising supply chain pressures, and volatile global financial conditions, however, weigh heavily on the outlook to the downside. Turning to the key messages from forward-looking surveys, consumer confidence (the current situation index) improved in the September 2024 survey round vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round on account of better perceptions about the general economic, employment, and income conditions. Consumers\u2019 optimism for the year ahead, measured by the future expectations index, also improved in the latest round vis-\u00e0-vis the previous one (Chart I.7).7 Optimism in the manufacturing sector for Q3:2024-25 improved in the July- September 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey (Chart I.8a). Services and infrastructure companies continue to maintain a highly optimistic outlook for Q3:2024-25 (Charts I.8b and I.8c). 6 Joice John, Deepak Kumar, Asish Thomas George, Pratik Mitra, Muneesh Kapur and Michael Debabrata Patra (2023), \u201cA Recalibrated Quarterly Projection Model (QPM 2.0) for India\u201d, Reserve Bank of India Bulletin, February, Volume LXXVII(2), pp.59-77. 7 The Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 (13 cities in the previous rounds) and the results of the September 2024 round are based on responses from 6,087 respondents. Recent surveys by other agencies report sequential improvement in business expectations relative to the previous round (Table I.4). Manufacturing and services firms in the PMI surveys for September 2024 remained upbeat for the year ahead though a marginal deceleration in expectations is observed vis-\u00e0-vis the previous month for manufacturing firms. Real GDP growth exceeded 8 per cent growth in the first three quarters of 2023-24 before dipping Professional forecasters polled in the September 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey expected real GDP marginally to 7.8 per cent in Q4.

Taking indicators and model forecasts, real GDP growth is expected at 7.2 per cent in 2024-25 with 7.0 per cent related disturbances due to climate change; and evenly balanced around the baseline (Chart I.10 and supply chain disruptions pose downside risks to the Table I.3).

The upside risks emanate from robust set out in Table 1.2. These baseline assumptions are, however, subject to uncertainties emanating from favourable monsoon rainfall; strengthening manufacturing and services sector activity sustained events. In this context, this section explores the by strong domestic demand; retreating global and plausible alternative scenarios to assess the balance Global economic activity is subject to uncertainties going forward. Policy divergence among major central growth and inflation could turn out to be higher by around 15 bps and 7 bps, respectively (Charts I.11a and I.12a). banks could trigger heightened volatility in global financial markets, with spillovers to emerging market economies. Services price and wage inflation remain might keep global interest rates higher for longer, The global economic outlook is also subject to in economic policies resulting from impending elections in major economies. In case these downside risks materialise, and, if global growth is 100 bps inflation could be lower than baseline projections by there is faster convergence in global disinflation and alignment in monetary policy paths going Global crude oil prices have exhibited some moderation, with Brent crude falling from a high of US$ 93 per barrel in mid-April 2024 to US$73 per barrel by end-September. Global growth recovery, continuation of geo-political tensions and non- reversal of production cut by OPEC plus may put upward pressure on crude oil prices. In this scenario, assuming crude oil price to be 10 per cent above the baseline and full pass-through to domestic product prices, domestic inflation could be higher by 30 bps and growth weaker by around 15 bps, respectively. Conversely, early resolution of geopolitical tensions, weak global demand, higher production from non- OPEC economies along with unwinding of production cuts by OPEC plus may soften crude oil prices. If crude oil prices fall by 10 per cent relative to the baseline, inflation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 15 bps to India\u2019s real GDP growth (Charts I.11a and I.12a). geopolitical tensions, there can be an upside to global growth. If global growth is higher by 50 bps, domestic The Indian Rupee (INR) has remained steady against the US dollar, being least volatile among major EME currencies in recent months. Going ahead, restrictive monetary policy by major AEs to achieve the last mile of disinflation could limit attractiveness of EME assets and trigger reversal of capital flows. Crude oil and other global commodity prices could also harden in comparison with the baseline. In this scenario, if INR could be higher by around 35 bps while GDP growth could edge up by around 25 bps through short term stimulation of exports. On the other hand, the Indian economy remains the fastest growing major economy globally and is poised to play an important role in revival of global growth. These developments, along would attract foreign investors. In this scenario, if the Food inflation remained persistently high in H1:2024- 25, driven by high prices in cereals and pulses along with large shocks to vegetable prices triggered by recurrent adverse climate events of rising intensity. Further, food prices may be subject to extreme weather events such as excess rains and floods affecting kharif crops, unseasonal rains typically associated with extreme La Ni\u00f1a conditions, which may result in damage of winter crops and perishables. In such a scenario, there could be upward pressures on food prices and could raise headline inflation by around 50 bps over the baseline. Persistent shocks to food inflation warrant a cautious approach by monetary policy to contain spillover effects (Box I.1). On the other hand, kharif sowing remained robust, with higher acreage for major crops. Reservoir levels, too, are higher than both last year\u2019s levels and the decadal average, which augurs well for the rabi season. These developments along with effective supply management measures may result in easing of food inflation pressures and could lower headline inflation by 50 bps compared with the baseline (Charts I.11b and I.12b). inflation and GDP growth could moderate by around 35 no policy response. In the event of repeated shocks are conditional on the size and duration of shocks to food to food inflation, however, there may be spillover to prices and their transmission to headline inflation.

Domestic economic activity is expected to remain revival of private consumption is buoyed by receding inflation and pick-up in rural demand is expected to be its mainstay. The Government\u2019s capex push corporate and bank balance sheets and improved outlook of global growth and trade are further aiding downward trajectory and is expected to moderate further in 2024-25, though the pace may be slow and uneven. Core inflation has bottomed out but remains subdued, supported by disinflationary monetary policy. The last mile of disinflation is contingent upon reining in food inflation and checking its spillover impact on inflation expectations and core inflation. Monetary policy remains steadfast on aligning inflation with the target. Geopolitical conflicts, uncertain global outlook, volatile global financial markets, and climate shocks remain key risks to the growth and inflation outlook. the growth momentum. Headline inflation is on a Headline CPI inflation after remaining sticky till June 2024, fell sharply thereafter buoyed by favourable base effects. The wedge between headline and core inflation widened further in June, before moderating in July- August. Input costs have remained subdued while rural wages and manufacturing staff cost growth decelerated. Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation1 remained sticky at around 5 per cent during March to June 2024, with key groups displaying considerable divergence. Food inflation edged up from an elevated level of 7.8 per cent in February 2024 to 8.4 per cent by June under the impact of repeated supply-side shocks. Deflation in fuel prices deepened from (-)0.8 per cent in February to (-)3.6 per cent in June. Core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation2 softened from 3.4 per cent to 3.1 per cent over the same period, the lowest reading recorded in the current CPI (2012=100) series so far. The wedge between headline and core inflation widened, from 1.7 percentage points in February 2024 to 2.0 percentage points in June. In July-August 2024, headline CPI inflation fell sharply to 3.6-3.7 per cent, buoyed by large favourable base effects in July, which also pulled food inflation down to 5.1-5.3 per cent. Core inflation edged up to around fuel prices intensified (Chart II.1). to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections, if any, and explain the underlying reasons thereof. The April 2024 MPR had projected outcomes have largely mirrored these projections. 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in the all-India consumer price index (CPI) produced by the National Statistical Office (NSO). 2 Core CPI, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups \u2018food and beverages\u2019 and \u2018fuel and light\u2019 from the headline CPI. in Q2 (July to September), induced by large favourable base effects in July, was also confirmed by actual September) had also factored in a likely pick-up in favourable base effects. In the second phase from July, CPI price momentum remained firm across food and core groups, while statistical gains from favourable base effects pulled down headline CPI inflation by 1.5 percentage points to 3.6 per cent. In August, the modest increase in headline inflation by 5 basis points (bps) to around 3.7 per cent reflected base effects only as the overall prices remained unchanged (Chart II.3). have undergone two distinct phases. First, after moderating to 4.9 per cent in March from 5.1 per cent in February, on favourable base effects and a sharp fall in fuel price momentum3, headline inflation remained steady at 4.8 per cent in April-May and edged up thereafter to 5.1 per cent in June due to a sharp pick up in price momentum triggered by an The distribution of CPI inflation in 2024 so far (January-August) reflects a lower median and mean along with lower standard deviation than a year ago when large and multiple food price shocks had played an outsized role (Chart II.4). Stickiness in headline inflation between January-June 2024 was accompanied by a considerable divergence in food, fuel and core inflation trajectories. In July-August, increase in food prices, notwithstanding significant 3 A change in CPI year-on-year (y-o-y) inflation between any two months is the difference between the current month-on-month (m-o-m) change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details, see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. a fall in food inflation led to narrowing of these divergences (Chart II.5). Diffusion indices (DIs)4 remained in high expansionary zone between March and August 2024, indicative of positive price increases across a broad spectrum of the CPI basket. After recording a transient uptick in March 2024, headline CPI DI dipped in April-May across both goods and services components. During June-August 2024, headline CPI DI edged up due to wider dispersion of price increases, first in goods and thereafter in services (Chart II.6a). Threshold DI5 \u2013 for price increases in excess of 4 per cent as well as 4 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their m-o-m seasonally adjusted prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. The higher the reading above 50, the broader is the expansion or generalisation of price increases; the further is the reading below 50, the broader is the price decline across items. 5 Threshold diffusion indices capture the dispersion of price increases in CPI basket beyond the specified saar thresholds of 4 per cent and 6 per cent. 6 per cent on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (saar) basis \u2013 continued to remain well below the 50 level mark, indicating little incidence of any broad- basing of such price momentum (Chart II.6b). to overall inflation - after being the major driver of inflation in the last four successive quarters - and from the disinflationary impact of past monetary policy actions (Chart II.7a). A historical decomposition of inflation using a vector autoregression (VAR)6 model indicates that the moderation in inflation in Q2:2024-25 stemmed from the negative contribution of supply side shocks Goods inflation (with a weight of 76.6 per cent in the overall CPI) contributed around 88 per cent of headline inflation between March and June 2024 and around 82 per cent in July and August 2024 (Chart II.7b). The contribution of services (with a weight of 23.4 per cent) edged up over this period due to the pick-up 6 Historical decomposition estimates the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period (Q4:2010-11 to Q4:2024-25) based on a vector autoregression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 crude oil prices (US$ per barrel); exchange rate (INR per US$), asset price (BSE Sensex), CPI; the output gap; rural wages; the policy repo rate; and money supply (M3). All variables other than policy repo rate are y-o-y growth rates. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt = c + A Yt-1 + et; where et represents a vector of shocks. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. in mobile tariffs. The increase in the contribution of perishable items (non-durable with a 7-day recall7), which include vegetables, spices, fruits and other food items such as milk, meat and fish and prepared meals, contributed to the stickiness in inflation in Q1. The contribution of semi-perishables (non- durable goods with a 30-day recall) to overall inflation remained broadly unchanged with cereals, pulses, and personal care items being the main inflation drivers. The contribution of durable items (goods with a 365- day recall) to overall inflation edged up during April- August 2024, primarily reflecting the uptick in gold prices. Food and beverages (weight of 45.9 per cent in the CPI basket) inflation exhibited distinct phases during the year so far. It averaged 8.0 per cent during April- June 2024, as weather disturbances such as heatwave conditions and uneven rainfall distribution, as well as tight supply conditions led to inflationary pressures in vegetables, cereals, and pulses. There was, however, a sharp moderation in food inflation to 5.1 per cent in July 2024, as favourable base effects more than offset a significant pickup in momentum. In August, despite a decline in food price momentum, food inflation increased to 5.3 per cent due to unfavourable base effects (Chart II.8). imported components8 to The contribution of headline inflation turned positive from April 2024 and increased gradually to 0.5 percentage points by August 2024, driven by higher gold and silver prices (Chart II.7c). The food price build-up during 2024-25 so far (up to August) has been substantial, although lower than last year and the long-term historical average. High 7 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Under MMRP, data are collected on expenditure incurred during the last seven days for frequently purchased items like edible oil, eggs, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, spices, beverages, processed foods, pan, tobacco and intoxicants; expenditure incurred during the last 365 days for items like clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods; and expenditure incurred in the last 30 days for all other food, fuel and light, miscellaneous goods and services including non-institutional medical services, rents and taxes. 8 Global commodities that drive domestic prices include petroleum products; coal; electronic goods; gold; silver; chemical products; metal products; textiles; cereals; milk products, and vegetables oils \u2013 these together have a weight of 36.4 per cent in the CPI basket. Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI - food and beverages. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. vegetable prices contributed a disproportionately large share to this build-up for the second successive year in a row (Chart II.9). Cereals (weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group) inflation remained elevated at an average of 8.3 per cent during April-August 2024 (Chart II.10). Within cereals, rice inflation remained in double digits, despite export restrictions, reflecting tight supply conditions due to lower rabi and summer production [(-)2.4 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2023-24]. For effective supply management and price stabilisation, government has announced several measures including the retail sale of \u2018Bharat Rice\u2019 and allowing rice-deficient states to directly purchase rice from the Food Corporation of India at a fixed price of \u20b92800/quintal under the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) from August 2024. The buffer stocks of rice (3.0 times the norm as of September 16, 2024) are comfortable and kharif sowing has been higher by 2.5 per cent in 2024-25 as on September 27, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of last year, which are likely to improve supply conditions and contain price pressures. With signs of easing of supply conditions, government has lifted the ban on exports of non-basmati white rice subject to a minimum export price (MEP) of $490/tonne, while removing the MEP on Basmati rice in September 2024 to support farmers\u2019 price realisation. Wheat inflation, on the other hand, was moderating till February 2024, but it hardened thereafter to reach 6.6 per cent in August, reflecting lower buffer stocks (0.9 times the norm as of September 16, 2024) and lower mandi arrivals than in 2023-24. Wheat inflation was elevated despite higher production and price stabilisation measures, including the imposition of stock limits for traders/wholesalers and retailers till March 2025, the likely offloading of stocks under the OMSS and continued restrictions on wheat exports. Vegetables (weight of 6.0 per cent in the CPI and 13.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) inflation remained elevated till June 2024, but witnessed a sharp correction in July primarily because of favourable base effect (Chart II.11). The price momentum, however, remained firm in July, reflecting lower production [(-)3.2 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23 as per 3rd advance estimates (AE) 2023-24] and supply disruptions due to heatwave conditions in parts of northern India, excess rains in parts of central and southern India and the resultant lower market arrivals. As supplies resumed, Note: Figures in parentheses indicate items' weights in CPI-vegetables. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. vegetable prices declined in August, particularly from increased sequentially in 2024, reaching 65 per cent in July-August, driven by production shortfalls [(-)5.1 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23 as per 3rd AE 2023- producing states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Bihar. Onion prices moderated during January- February 2024, but started rising again, recording a y-o-y inflation of 60.6 per cent in July 2024 and 54.1 per cent in August due to deficient production [(-)19.7 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23 as per 3rd AE 2023-24]. For effective supply management, onion exports were allowed and 40 per cent export duty with a MEP of $550 per metric tonne was imposed in May 2024. Subsequently, in September 2024, the export duty was reduced to 20 per cent, and MEP was removed, allowing free shipments of onion. Tomato price increase, which averaged around 37 per cent during December 2023-June 2024 on a y-o-y basis, was on account of tight supply conditions induced by heatwaves and unseasonal rainfall. Prices declined by (-)43.0 per cent, on a y-o-y basis, in July 2024 as a strong favourable base effect outweighed the substantial increase in price momentum. Softening in prices in August further pulled down tomato inflation to (-)47.9 per cent. Vegetables excluding TOP (tomato; onion; and potato), particularly garlic, also witnessed considerable price build-up in Q1:2024- 25, emerging as another major driver of vegetables inflation (Chart II.12). Inflation in fruits (weight of 2.9 per cent in the CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages group) eased in July on a strong favourable base effect, after rising during April-June 2024 to 6.3 per cent on average. In August, it rose to 6.5 per cent despite higher production (2.3 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23 as per the 3rd AE), with price increases primarily driven by bananas, apples and mangoes. Inflation in groundnut prices, however, moderated from around 10.4 per cent in December 2023 to 1.7 per cent in July 2024 before falling into the deflationary zone at (-)1.5 per cent in August 2024, on account of higher kharif production (1.1 per cent in 2023-24). Pulses, the primary source of plant-based protein (weight of 2.4 per cent in the CPI and 5.2 per cent in the food and beverages group), continued to record double-digit inflation due to deficient kharif and rabi production [(-)7.0 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23] on top of a decline in production in 2022-23. Within pulses, lower production of gram [(-)10 per cent in 2023-24], urad [(-)11.9 per cent] and moong [(-)15.6 per cent] as well as subdued production in tur (3.2 per cent increase in 2023-24 over 2022-23 against 21.5 per cent decline in 2022-23) were the primary drivers of price pressures (Chart II.13). Inflation in pulses prices moderated to 13.6 per cent in August 2024 on interventions to ease supply conditions through imposition of stock limits on tur and gram (till September 30, 2024), extension of free import policy for yellow peas (till December 31, 2024), and tur and urad (till March 31, 2025), weekly stock disclosure requirements for five major pulses, and sale of chana dal under the brand \u2018Bharat Dal\u2019. As a result, the stock-to-use ratio improved to 6.8 per cent during April-August 2024 from 6.5 per cent during the corresponding period of 2023 (Chart II.14). Animal-based protein items exhibited high and volatile inflation movements during April-August 2024. Inflation in prices of meat and fish (weight of 3.6 per cent in the CPI and 7.9 per cent in the food and beverages group) averaged 6.2 per cent during April-August 2024. Inflation in the price of eggs (weight of 0.43 per cent in the CPI and 0.9 per cent in the food and beverages group) exhibited considerable volatility, falling from 10.3 per cent in March to 4.1 per cent in June before increasing to 7.1 per cent in August. Inflation in milk and products (weight of 6.6 per cent in the CPI and 14.4 per cent within the food and beverages group) has remained range bound at around 3 per cent during April-August. Although milk price hikes by several cooperatives, including Amul and Mother Dairy, in June 2024 led to higher price momentum in June, it was offset by favourable base effects (Chart II.15). 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A 4 2 - r p A 4 2 - g u A Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI-animal protein group.

The pace of deflation, however, moderated, with continued positive momentum reflecting pick-up in international edible oil prices as 2023-24 season [(-)4.1 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022- 23]. The current kharif season sowing of oilseeds has been encouraging, particularly for groundnut. on crude palm, sunflower and soyabean oil were extended till March 2025.

Among other items in the oils and fats sub-group, inflation in ghee and butter prices continued to moderate. 25 compared to H2:2023-24 despite lower sugarcane production [(-)7.6 per cent in 2023-24 over 2022-23]. Measures to augment domestic availability of sugar include extension of export restrictions, and imposition of 50 per cent export duty on molasses used for ethanol production as well as restriction on the use of sugarcane juice and syrup for ethanol production since December 2023. The restrictions on sugar diversion for ethanol production were, however, eased in August 2024. Among other food items, inflation in spices moderated on a sustained basis since April 2024 and slipped into deflation since July after recording double-digit inflation for a 22-month period till March 2024. The recent decline was led by jeera and dry chillies, on account of higher spices production (5.5 per cent as per 3rd AE in 2023-24 over 2022-23).

After recording a sustained increase between September 2023 and January 2024, pulses price margins witnessed a sustained decrease during February-September 2024. Retail price margins in edible oils continued to soften since June 2024, primarily due to the moderation in the margin of refined oils. Retail price margins of TOP vegetables started firming up from March 2024 onwards (Chart II.17). Heightened CPI food inflation pressures were seen across both rural and urban areas, with average rural food inflation during April to August 2024 outpacing its urban counterpart (Chart II.18). The deflation in fuel prices deepened from (-)0.8 per 2024, reflecting the cumulative impact of the LPG Fuel deflation was also aided by softening of price # Accounted for the unification of Daman and Diu with Dadra & Nagar Haveli and the formation of Ladakh as a Union Territory (UT).

Core (CPI excluding food and fuel) disinflation continued during H1 of 2024-25 (April-August) as it softened to 3.1 per cent by May-June 2024. This sustained sequential softening observed for more than a year (since June 2023) was disrupted in July- August 2024 with core inflation averaging 3.4 per cent, primarily reflecting the impact of mobile tariff revisions. Exclusion-based measures of underlying inflation, which remove volatile items such as petrol, diesel, gold, and silver in addition to food and fuel, also witnessed similar movements during this period (Chart II.20 and Table II.2). CPI excluding food and fuel (47.3) CPI excluding food fuel petrol diesel (45.0) CPI excluding food fuel petrol diesel gold silver (43.8) While diffusion index for CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver indicated positive price increases across much of its consitutents, a vast majority of these price increases were less than 6 per cent (m-o-m saar) and 4 per cent (m-o-m saar), as indicated by the steep fall in threshold DIs to well below the 50 level mark. Threshold DIs for CPI core, however, exhibited a sustained pick-up during June- August 2024, indicating a likely bottoming out of muted price momentum (Chart II.21).

Costs, as measured by WPI inflation in industrial raw materials and farm inputs, remained subdued during April-August 2024. While the prices of farm inputs remained in deflation, those of industrial inputs entered positive territory in June 2024, but turned negative again in August, mirroring movements in international commodity prices (Chart II.26). Prices of industrial inputs such as high-speed diesel (HSD), bitumen and petroleum coke were mostly in deflation during April-August 2024. The other contributory factors were non-food articles, particularly raw cotton and oilseeds, whose prices also recorded deflation during this period. Minerals price inflation, however, remained positive during April-August 2024, primarily driven by iron ore, due to increased global demand. Farm input prices remained in deflation, driven by those of high-speed diesel (HSD), electricity, and fodder and pesticides. Moving from input costs to wage costs, nominal rural wage growth (y-o-y) decelerated to 4.9 per cent in July 2024 from 5.7 per cent in March 2024 driven by both non-agricultural and agricultural occupations sustained a steady growth of around 0.45 per cent and month-on-month increase in agricultural wage was mainly driven by ploughing/tilling workers, followed by loggers and woodcutters, plant protection workers, and general agricultural labourers, while the increase in non-agricultural wages was on account of masons, electricians, and light motor vehicle and tractor drivers in the rural sector. Despite the deceleration in nominal rural wages, real rural wages (deflated using CPI rural inflation) recorded a marginal growth of 0.8 per cent in July from 0.2 per cent in March 2024, primarily reflecting the sharp fall in CPI rural inflation in July. prices are expected to soften across manufaturing, services and infrastructure sectors in Q3:2024-25. The pace of salary outgo is expected to moderate for services and infrastructure in Q3:2024-25 while it is anticipated to rise for manufacturing (Chart II.29). One year ahead business inflation expectations17 declined to 4.05 per cent in August 2024 from 4.21 per cent in the previous month on account of moderation in cost pressures with \u2018somewhat less than normal\u2019 or lower sales and subdued profit margin expectations. In the organised sector, staff cost growth (y-o-y) decelerated for manufacturing firms among listed companies in Q1:2024-25, while it remained steady for services firms. The share of staff cost in the value of production increased for manufacturing but stayed stable for services in Q1 (Chart II.28). Firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys16 indicate that in Q3:2024-25, the cost of inputs are expected to soften for manufacturing while and infrastructure sectors. On the other hand, selling remaining elevated As per the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), manufacturing firms, which had been reporting increasing input price pressures since March 2024, pointed to a moderation in the rate of input cost expansion during August-September 2024. In tandem with input prices, pace of output price increases across manufacturing also rose before decelerating in September 2024. This turned the input-output price gap for manufacturers marginally positive in September 2024. In case of services sector, the rate of expansion in input costs remained elevated during March-May 2024, before it saw a softening 16 Industrial Outlook Survey; and Services and Infrastructure Outlook Survey. 17 Based on the monthly Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

The prices charged across services firms, which had been lagging behind input price increases during March-June 2024, quickened in July 2024 on the back of pent up pass-through of rising labour and material costs. Subsequently, with cost pressures moderating, the rate of expansion in prices charged receded in August-September 2024 (Chart II.30). August) has been characterised by interruptions on core inflation. Food inflation could see an easing in H2 of 2024-25, benefiting from normal monsoons sustained, could impinge upon the food inflation muted with the continuing impact of disinflationary monetary policy stance and softening bias in international commodity prices. Recent pickup in global metals and crude oil prices and uncertainties on account of geopolitical developments need to be monitored. In the context of the apparent rigidities to the last mile of disinflation in the recent period, a steadfast commitment to alignment of inflation with the target is imperative to preserve and build upon the credibility gains in monetary policy achieved during the pre- and post-COVID flexible inflating targeting (FIT) period. A durable low inflation environment will strengthen the foundations of a sustained high growth trajectory. outlook. Core inflation pressures have remained Domestic economic activity in H1:2024-25 was supported by a strong performance from the two main drivers of aggregate demand \u2013 private consumption and investment activity. Improved agriculture prospects, sustained buoyancy in services, consumer and business optimism, government\u2019s continued thrust on capex, and healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates brighten the outlook. Geopolitical tensions, geoeconomic fragmentation, unseasonal rains and weather disturbances, and volatility in financial markets pose downside risks.

As per the latest round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey, consumer confidence (current situation index) improved in September 2024, along with an improvement in households' optimism on one year ahead economic conditions. Bank credit to households grew in double digits, despite the slowdown in unsecured personal loans and credit cards outstanding that set in after the November 16, 2023 measures (Chart III.3d). but contracted in July-August 2024. The index of Rural demand is showing a gradual pickup. While motorcycle sales continued to record upbeat growth in April-August 2024, tractor sales expanded in June- July 2024 (Chart III.4). The demand for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) contracted by 16.6 per cent in Q2:2024-25, reflecting an improvement in farm sector employment. Spending on fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) in the rural areas bodes well for rural demand. The positive outlook for agriculture, supported by above normal south-west monsoon (SWM) rainfall, higher cumulative kharif sowing and improved reservoir levels augurs well for sustaining the revival in rural demand. consumption demand while economic boosts uncertainty dampens it. As consumption of necessary items have lower elasticity of substitution than discretionary items, they are more insulated from Box III.1: Consumption Switching? Unravelling the Drivers behind Changing Consumption Patterns in India There has been a slowdown in private final consumption growth rate of 5.4 per cent) when compared with the pre- COVID period1 (average growth of 6.7 per cent).

Drawing on the real business cycle literature (Kydland and Prescott, 1982), consumption switching is analysed at the aggregate level using a quantile regression framework, based on the following specification rates hurt consumption growth, and the effect increases in the upper quantiles, i.e., when consumption growth is high. The income effect improves consumption growth, but the impact gradually moderates when consumption growth is high. Economic uncertainty acts as a dampener 4 C is the q-o-q growth of Notes: Bands around the point estimates are 95 per cent bootstrapped confidence intervals. 1 Pre-COVID period includes Q1:2012-13 to Q4:2019-20. 2 Robustness checks are carried out using the economic uncertainty index derived from SPF data by Patra et. al. (2023). Results are in similar lines. Next, the precautionary motive is linked to consumption switching by looking at consumption growth at a broad commodity level. Following a nested Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) approach (Fernandez-Villaverde and Guerron-Quintana, 2020), intra-temporal choices of households are governed by elasticity of substitution among the necessary and discretionary group of commodities i.e. discretionary spending is expected to recover steadily as income strengthens. A watchful monetary policy restricts the spillover of price pressure to discretionary spending, facilitating a rebound of aggregate demand.

The estimates show that the elasticity of substitution among the necessary items is lower than for discretionary items. The interest rate adversely impacts the consumption of discretionary items. Income effects strengthen the consumption of all items, and the effect is marginally higher on discretionary items. Policy uncertainty dampens consumption discretionary consumption demand (Table III.1.1). Standard errors in parentheses * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01 Baker, S. R., N. Bloom, and S. J.

Employment conditions remained robust in Q1:2024- capital goods expanded strongly during April-August, led by electronic goods, transport equipment and Construction activity gathered momentum on the back of an ebullient housing sector.

The interest coverage ratio (ICR)7 of listed private manufacturing companies improved in Q1:2024-25, indicating comfortable debt servicing capacity and conducive conditions for expansion in capacity. Within the services sector, the ICR of IT companies remained stable while that of non-IT companies stayed above the threshold level of unity (Chart III.8). Note: Data for Q1:2024-25 are based on results of 2,934 listed non-government non-financial companies. Source: RBI staff estimates. Interest coverage ratio is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to interest expenses and measures a company\u2019s capacity to make interest payments on its debt. The minimum value for a viable ICR is 1. Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) contracted by 0.2 per cent (y-o-y) in Q1:2024-25, pulling down overall GDP growth (Table III.1). The Government of India\u2019s (GoI) revenue expenditure excluding interest payments and major subsidies registered a modest increase of 3.1 per cent (y-o-y) during April-August 2024, whereas the capital expenditure contracted by 19.5 per cent during the same period8 (Chart III.9a). The revenue expenditure to capital outlay (RECO) ratio at 5.2 in April-August (4.1 a year ago) suggests some moderation in expenditure quality during the period. However, revenue deficit as per cent of gross fiscal deficit improved to 32.9 during the period (44.2 per cent a year ago) [Chart III.9b]. The Union Budget for 2024-25 reiterated the commitment towards fiscal prudence by budgeting a gross fiscal deficit (GFD) of 4.9 per cent of GDP, a drop of 66 basis points from the provisional actuals of 2023-24. This is in line with the medium-term target of achieving a GFD of less than 4.5 per cent of GDP by 2025-26. The quality of expenditure is budgeted to improve, with revenue expenditure to capital outlay ratio declining to an all-time low of 4.0. Moreover, capital expenditure is budgeted to increase to a two- decade high of 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2024-25 from 3.2 per cent in provisional actuals of 2023-24, which is expected to support growth during the year. On the receipts side, the central government\u2019s gross tax revenues increased by a 12.1 per cent (y-o-y) during April-August 2024, driven by a rise in income tax revenue. Indirect tax revenue expanded by 10.0 per cent (y-o-y), aided by goods and services tax (GST) collections (centre plus states) and customs duty collections. Overall, the robust tax collection is reflective of buoyant economy and effective enforcement by the tax authorities (Chart III.10). Custom duty receipts recorded a robust y-o-y increase of 12.9 per cent, whereas union excise duties grew by 4.2 per cent (y-o-y). Overall, net tax revenue of the central government increased by 8.7 per cent during April-August 2024 (Table III.2). Non-tax revenue receipts recorded a growth of 59.6 per cent primarily on the back of a surplus transfer of \u20b92.1 lakh crore from the Reserve Bank, which was 8 There has been a turnaround in Q2:2024-25 (July-August), with GoI's revenue expenditure excluding interest payments and major subsidies, and capital expenditure expanding by 9.6 per cent and 25.8 per cent, respectively.

Accordingly, the central government\u2019s gross fiscal deficit (GFD) during April- August 2024 stood at 27.0 per cent of the budget estimates, substantially lower than a year ago. The consolidated GFD of state governments is budgeted at 3.1 per cent of GDP in 2024-25, marginally higher than 2.9 per cent in 2023-24 provisional accounts (PA). Growth in revenue receipts is budgeted to accelerate to 19.1 per cent. States\u2019 capital spending is expected to rise by 21.0 per cent in 2024-25 on top of 23.4 per cent growth a year ago. The revenue deficit (RD) is expected to remain stable at 0.2 per cent of Notes: A: Actuals; PA: Provisional Accounts; BE: Budget Estimates. Data pertain to 31 States/UTs. Sources: Budget Documents of State Governments; and Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India. As per the data available for April-July 2024-25, states\u2019 GFD increased due to higher revenue expenditure and a contraction in grants from the GoI (Chart III.13a). Both tax and non-tax revenues, however, recorded robust growth (Chart III.13b). Meanwhile, on a y-o-y basis, capital expenditure declined. The Union Budget 2024-25 has made a provision of \u20b91.5 lakh crore for long-term interest-free loans, which could assist States in boosting their capital spending. The Union Budget for 2024-25 allocated gross and net market borrowings via dated securities amounting to \u20b914.01 lakh crore and \u20b911.63 lakh crore, respectively. In the first half of the fiscal year, the central government\u2019s gross market borrowings amounted to \u20b97.40 lakh crore, accounting for 52.8 per cent of the annual budget estimates (Table III.4). The weighted Note: Data pertain to 31 states/UTs. Sources: Budget Documents of State Governments; and CAG. average yield of these issuances during this period was 7.0 per cent, marginally lower than 7.2 per cent recorded in the previous year, while the weighted average maturity elongated to 20.7 years, up from 17.6 years. During H2, the Centre has planned gross market borrowings through dated securities of \u20b96.61 lakh crore. Concurrently, States raised \u20b93.86 lakh crore in gross market borrowings during H1:2024-25, against an indicative calendar amount of \u20b95.18 lakh crore. For Q3:2024-25, the indicative calendar has placed states\u2019 gross market borrowings at \u20b93.20 lakh crore. To meet the transitory mismatches between receipts and expenditures, the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) limit for the GoI was set at \u20b91.5 lakh crore for H1:2024-25; it has been fixed at \u20b950,000 crore for H2. Taking into account the recent expenditure trends, imports rose by 7.1 per cent (y-o-y) during this period. Consequently, the merchandise trade deficit widened to US$ 116.7 billion from US$ 99.2 billion during the corresponding period a year ago (Chart III.14). As per the estimates released by the NSO, exports of goods and services increased by 8.7 per cent y-o-y in real terms in Q1:2024-25, and imports of goods and services grew by 4.4 per cent. the WMA limits for States and Union Territories have been increased to \u20b960,118 crore from the previous limit of \u20b947,010 crore, effective from July 1, 2024.9 India\u2019s external demand revived in H1:2024-25 (April-August), buoyed by a recovery in global trade. Merchandise exports (US$) expanded by 1.1 per cent Merchandise exports growth, after experiencing a pickup in Q1:2024-25, contracted in Q2 (up to August). For H1:2024-25 (April-August), the growth in merchandise exports was mainly led by electronic goods, engineering goods, drugs and pharmaceuticals, readymade garments, and organic and inorganic chemicals. On the other hand, petroleum products, gems and jewellery, rice, marine products, and iron ore dragged down exports (Chart III.15). The expansion in merchandise imports in H1:2024- 25 (April-August) was driven by higher imports of petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL), gold and non- POL non-gold commodities such as electronic goods, transport equipment, and silver. Import of pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, chemical material and products, coal, coke and briquettes, fertilisers, and dyeing materials contributed negatively to the overall import growth (Chart III.16). POL imports grew by 9.2 per cent (y-o-y) to US$ 76.4 billion in H1 (April- August), while non-POL non-gold imports rose by 4.5 per cent (y-o-y) to US$ 196.2 billion during this period. Services exports remained buoyant, with a growth of 9.8 per cent y-o-y in Q1:2024-25 and 10.9 per 9 Based on the recommendations made by the Group constituted by the Reserve Bank and consisting of select State Finance Secretaries.

Among the major exporters of services globally, India retained its position in the top ten exporting countries during January-June 2024. Services imports moved out of the contractionary zone, posting a 7.2 per cent y-o-y On a balance of payments basis, the current account deficit widened marginally to 1.1 per cent of GDP in Q1:2024-25 from a deficit of 1.0 per cent of GDP in Q1:2023-24 and a surplus of 0.5 per cent of GDP in Q4:2023-24, mainly due to higher merchandise trade deficit.

Notes: Net FDI data for Q2: 2024-25 is up to July 2024. deficit (CAD) narrowed to 0.7 per cent of GDP from 2.0 per cent in 2022-23, driven by a lower merchandise trade deficit, robust services exports and substantial inward remittances. In the financial account, net FDI flows increased to US$ 4.9 billion in April-July 2024 from US$ 3.8 billion a year ago, on account of robust gross equity inflows (Chart III.18). Singapore, Mauritius, Netherlands, USA and Belgium were the major sources of FDI inflows, accounting for a share of 70.8 per cent. On the sectoral front, manufacturing, financial services, communication services, computer services and electricity and other generation, distribution and transmission attracted the majority of FDI equity inflows with a share of 77.3 per cent. External commercial borrowing flows moderated to US$ 3.6 billion in April-August 2024 from US$ 4.3 billion a year ago. On the other hand, net accretions to non-resident deposits surged to US$ 5.8 billion in April-July 2024 from US$ 3.0 billion a year ago, led by higher inflows in all three accounts [foreign currency non-resident (FCNR), non-resident external (NRE) and non-resident ordinary (NRO) accounts]. As on September 27, 2024 India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves amounted to US$ 704.9 billion, equivalent to 12.1 months of annualised merchandise imports as per BoP basis and 103.3 per cent of outstanding external debt at end-June 2024. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) moderated in Q1:2024-25 mainly due to net outflows in equities, though debt inflows have remained robust after the announcement of inclusion of Indian government bonds in the J.P.Morgan\u2019s benchmark emerging market index. FPI inflows, however, registered a turnaround in Q2:2024-25 with continued surge in debt inflows and a revival in equity flows. FPI inflows of US$ 20.1 billion were recorded in H1: 2024-25 as against net inflows of US$ 20.3 billion a year ago. Aggregate supply \u2013 measured by real gross value added (GVA) at basic prices \u2013 expanded by 6.8 per cent y-o-y in Q1:2024-25 (8.3 per cent a year ago)- a three-quarter high, supported by industry and services (Table III.5). The momentum of GVA improved over the previous quarter (Chart III.19). Real GVA in agriculture, forestry and fishing slowed to 2.0 per cent in Q1:2024-25 (3.7 per cent a year ago) on account of muted growth in foodgrains production Note: FRE: First revised estimates; PE: Provisional estimates. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. during rabi and summer seasons. The southwest monsoon (SWM) commenced at a sluggish pace in June; however, it gained momentum from July onwards. By July 2, 2024, monsoon rainfall had covered the whole country and precipitation turned into a surplus of 8 per cent by September 30, 2024 (Chart III.20a). Out of the 36 sub-divisions, 33 experienced normal or above-normal rainfall, reflecting a broadly equitable distribution (Chart III.20b). The robust progression of monsoon rains enabled increased acreage of kharif sowing, which saw a 1.9 per cent rise over the previous year and exceeded normal sowing levels by 1.7 per cent as of September 27, 2024. The area devoted to all major crops, barring cotton, was greater than in the previous year. Specifically, the area under rice \u2013 constituting nearly 37 per cent of the kharif sowing area \u2013 rose by 2.5 per cent from the previous year\u2019s acreage. Similarly, the area covered by pulses and oilseeds sowing expanded by 7.4 per cent and 2.7 per cent, respectively (Chart III.20c). The enhanced rainfall also facilitated the replenishment of reservoir levels to 87 per cent of total capacity as of September 26, 2024, a marked improvement from the historically low levels recorded in June 2024 (Chart III.20d). With these elevated reservoir levels and the anticipated onset of La Ni\u00f1a later in the year, the outlook for rabi crop appears promising. As of September 30, 2024 the production-weighted rainfall index (PRN) stood at 107 per cent, surpassing the 93 per cent level recorded during the same period last year (Chart III.20e). The resurgence of rainfall in the North-Western states of India contributed to a higher PRN relative to the Note: saar - Seasonally adjusted annualised rate. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates.

Furthermore, the crop-specific PRN exceeded both last year's position and the five-year average across all crops (Chart III.20f). According to the final estimates of crop production for 2023-24, total foodgrain production at 3,323 lakh tonnes recoded an increase of 0.8 per cent over the final estimates of 2022-23 and 1.0 per cent over the third advance estimates of 2023-24. Among major crops, rice and wheat production increased on y-o-y basis by 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively, whereas coarse cereals, pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane and cotton recorded a decline in production during the year (Table III.6). The government announced an increase of 1.4\u201312.7 per cent in minimum support prices (MSP) for kharif 2024-25 crops, ensuring a return of at least 50 per cent over the cost of production (as measured by A2 plus FL10). This adjustment aligns with the 10 A2 (out of pocket expenses) plus FL (family labour) includes all paid out costs such as expenses on hired labour, machines, rent paid for leased land, seeds, fertilisers, irrigation charges, depreciation as well as imputed value of family labour. Government\u2019s recent efforts to recalibrate MSPs in favour of oilseeds, pulses, and nutri-cereals, aiming to foster crop diversification, rectify the demand- supply disparity, and advance sustainable agricultural practices. Procurement of rice during the kharif marketing season 2023-24 (up to September 30, 2024) at 525.4 lakh tonnes was 7.7 per cent lower than in the previous year. Despite this reduction, the stock of rice held by the Food Corporation of India at 408.8 lakh tonnes as of September 16, 2024 was the highest ever held by them compared to the corresponding date in the previous years and is 3 times the quarterly buffer norms. Rice allocation under the Open Market Sales Scheme (OMSS) fell way short of the target, partly owing to subdued demand for the variety of rice offered by the corporation (Chart III.21a).

Investment activity demonstrated unseasonal rains and weather disturbances pose Q1:2024-25. Looking ahead, brighter agriculture Domestic financial markets exhibited orderly movements in contrast to volatile global market conditions during H1:2024-25. Money market rates evolved in line with liquidity shifts while long-term bond yields eased. Banks\u2019 lending and deposit rates increased, reflecting ongoing monetary policy transmission. The Reserve Bank conducted two-way market operations while ensuring adequate liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy. During H1:2024-25, financial markets global sporadically turned volatile in response to changing perceptions on the future monetary policy trajectory, sparked by data releases. Global bond yields moderated in response to the improving inflation outlook and cooling labour markets. Global equity markets gained in H1 amidst intermittent bouts of sell-offs. The US dollar traded with a weakening bias and currencies of emerging market economies (EMEs) mirrored its movements, exacerbated by swings in capital flows. Since the second half of September, however, bond yields hardened and the dollar index firmed up reversing its earlier trend (see Chapter V for details). resilient. Money market rates evolved in sync with liquidity shifts. Long-term government bond yields eased in response to domestic developments and global cues. Equity markets remained buoyant, with sporadic episodes of course corrections. The INR traded with a depreciating bias against the US dollar in H1 but remained among the least volatile major EME currencies. In the credit market, growth in bank credit outpaced deposit expansion although the wedge has narrowed more recently. During H1:2024-25, liquidity conditions transitioned to surplus from deficit in H2:2023-24 (see Section IV.3 for details). As a result, overnight money market rates softened and generally remained within In contrast to global developments, domestic financial markets remained relatively stable and In response to the changing liquidity dynamics, the Reserve Bank conducted two-way operations under the LAF to ensure that the weighted average call rate (WACR) \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 remained closely aligned with the policy repo rate. The WACR increased sharply during June 27-28 due to quarter-end liquidity tightness, also evident from a sudden spike in borrowings under the marginal standing facility (MSF). The WACR, which remained mostly above the repo rate until end-June 2024, moderated from July 2024 as liquidity conditions eased with a pick-up in government spending. At the end of H1 (September 30), however, the WACR increased by 15 bps on account of banks reducing their exposures in the uncollateralised market which incur higher Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) requirements in the ensuing quarter.1 On an average basis, the WACR remained 5 basis points (bps) above the policy repo rate during H1, as compared with 21 bps in H2:2023-24 (Chart IV.1b). Volatility in the WACR, as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV), moderated to 1.61 per cent during H1 from 1.77 per cent during H2:2023-24. Movements in overnight rates in the collateralised segment, i.e., tri-party repo (TREPS) and market repo were broadly aligned with the WACR. Money market activity was dominated by the collateralised segments, with their share in overnight money market volumes remaining unchanged at 98.0 per cent in H1 (Chart IV.2). Mutual funds (MFs) remained the major lenders in TREPS, although their share moderated to 65 per cent in H1 from 66 per cent in H2:2023-24. In the market repo segment, the share of MFs increased to 41 per cent in H1 from 33 per cent, with a concomitant decline in the share of foreign banks to 34 per cent from 43 per cent. On the borrowing side, public sector banks (PSBs) remained the dominant players in TREPS, with their share increasing to 47 per cent in H1 from 45 per cent in H2:2023-24. In market repo, however, their share reduced to 4 per cent from 9 per cent over the same period. In the longer-term segments of the money market, rates on commercial papers (CPs), certificates of deposit (CDs) and T-bills softened during H1 1 Additionally, the tightness in the overnight segment was compounded by mutual funds reducing their lending in tri-party repo due to redemption pressures. the banking system and reduced supply of shorter maturity T-bills (Chart IV.3). Rates on CPs issued (NBFCs), by non-banking however, remained elevated reflecting, inter alia, the increase in risk weights on bank lending to NBFCs announced by the Reserve Bank on November 16, 2023. The average spreads of T-bills, CDs and CPs over the MSF rate softened to zero, 49 bps and 61 bps, in H1 from 19 bps, 74 bps and 100 bps, respectively, in H2:2023-24. 4.0 lakh crore Fresh issuances of CDs moderated to in H1 from 5.5 lakh crore in H2:2023-24, mainly due to surplus liquidity conditions since July 2024. Within H1, CD issuances in the shorter tenor (up to 91-day) declined, with their share in total issuances reducing to 54 per cent in July 2024 from 84 per cent in May 2024. Concomitantly, the share of longer tenor CDs (181-365 days) increased to 45 per cent in July 2024 from 14 per cent in May 2024 (Chart IV.4). The persistent gap in credit and deposit growth prompted banks to explore alternative sources such as CDs of longer tenors to bridge the funding gap. lakh crore in H2:2023-24 (Chart IV.5a). Among fresh issuances, the average share of NBFCs increased to 32 per cent in H1 from 29 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Thus, NBFCs have resorted to greater mobilisation of resources from the market in the wake of the November 2023 measures, as mentioned earlier. In the CP market, corporates were the major players with a share of 38 per cent in Resource mobilisation through fresh issuances of 6.7 CPs increased to Outstanding (as at end-period) week of May, buoyed by positive sentiments on the inclusion of Indian G-secs in global bond indices and the buyback of government paper. Yields remained largely stable during the month of June and July, moderating towards the end of July due to market reactions to a potential increase in the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) based on the draft guidelines on LCR issued by the RBI. Yields continued to moderate in August and September on lower inflation prints (for July and August) and the start of the policy easing cycle in the US. segment had the largest share of fresh CP issuances During H1, G-sec yields softened (Chart IV.6). At the beginning of the financial year, yields hardened, The yields on T-bills moderated during May and June 60,000 amidst reduction in the supply of T-bills by crore. The softening bias continued to prevail thereafter till September as liquidity continued to remain in surplus and also in the wake of the cancellation of treasury bill auctions scheduled for the second half of the month (Chart IV.7). tracking movements in US yields and the increase in crude oil prices. Thereafter, they eased during the easing crude oil prices in the wake of the US Federal to reduce the pace of balance sheet runoff from June The average trading volume in G-secs and T-bills increased in H1:2024-25 relative to H2:2023-24 (Chart IV.8). The weighted average yield (WAY) on traded maturities for G-secs and T-bills declined by 23 bps and 19 bps, respectively, in H1 from that in H2:2023-24. The overall dynamics of the yield curve are captured by its latent factors viz., level, slope and curvature2. Yields have softened across the term structure as reflected in the downward shift of the yield curve during H1 (Chart IV.9a), with the average level of yields softening by 29 bps while the slope of the yield curve increased by 26 bps due to the relatively higher decline in short-term rates (Chart IV.9b). The curvature, on the other hand, increased by 18 bps, reflecting the hardening bias in the mid-segment vis-\u00e0-vis the short and long term. In the Indian context, the level and curvature of the yield curve are 2 The level is the average of par yields of all tenors up to 30-years published by FBIL and the slope (term spread) is the difference in par yields of 3-months and 30-year maturities. The curvature is calculated as twice the 15-year yield minus the sum of 30-year and 3-month yields. found to have more information content on future On a review of prevailing market conditions, of India (GoI), announced that all securities under the market borrowing programme of the GoI shall be auctioned by the multiple price auction method, effective April 1, 2024.

Nevertheless, the risk premium (the spread of 3-year AAA corporate bond yields over 3-year G-sec yields) increased from 44 bps to 71 bps for PSUs, FIs and banks; from 80 bps to 102 bps for NBFCs; and from 77 bps to 97 bps for corporates, in H1:2024-25 due to sharper decline in G-sec yields (Chart IV.11b). of comparable maturities was 31 bps in H1:2024- 25 (Chart IV.10). The average inter-state spread on securities of 10-year tenor (fresh issuances) was 2 bps The increase in risk premia was evident across tenors and the rating spectrum amidst moderation in corporate performance in Q1:2024-25 (Table IV.2). 3 Patra, M.D., Joice, J., Kushwaha, K.M., and I.

Despite transient surges in volatility, Indian equity markets maintained an upward in H1:2024-25, with the BSE Sensex surpassing the historic 80,000 mark in July 2024. Amidst these gains, market valuation, as measured by the trailing price- earnings ratio of the BSE Sensex, continued to remain above its long-term average and reached 24.8 at end- September 2024. Indian equities began the financial year positively, driven by strong domestic and global macroeconomic data and robust domestic corporate earnings. Thereafter, markets declined briefly amidst rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle-East. After the initial losses in May, the market capitalisation of Indian listed companies surpassed US$ 5 trillion in the wake of positive market sentiments from improved GoI finances and other domestic and global cues. In early June, the market exhibited large swings during the announcement of Lok Sabha election results, which drove the India VIX6 to its highest levels since the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war. Thereafter, markets recovered quickly amidst expectations of policy continuity, release of softer than-expected domestic as well as US inflation for May and India\u2019s current account turning into a surplus in Q4:2023-24. In July, gains in IT sector stocks and dovish signals from the US Fed propelled the Sensex past the 80,000 mark before its correction later in the month on the budgetary announcement of changes in the capital gains tax structure. 6 A measure of short-term expected volatility of Nifty 50. Indian financial markets faced a fresh bout of of portfolio flows. Thereafter, markets recovered combination of factors: (i) elevated geopolitical as expectations of a US Fed rate cut grew stronger expected economic data from the US; and (iii) the Bank of Japan (BoJ) raising rates for the second time in 17 years. The BoJ's actions prompted a sudden and imminent policy pivot. The resulting surprises on large unwinding of yen carry trade. The resulting the future path of monetary policy have a profound US equity market meltdown led to heightened Monetary policy surprises can be decomposed into \u2018target\u2019 and \u2018path\u2019 factors. The former reflects unexpected changes in the contemporaneous policy rate, while the latter represents surprises in its future trajectory. Intraday changes in 1-year MIBOR-linked OIS rates on policy announcement days are used as a measure of policy surprise (Lloyd, 2018).7 The target factor is the difference between the actual repo rate and the mean expectations of the repo rate from the Bloomberg Economists\u2019 survey (Anderson 2010). The path factor is estimated as the residual of a regression of changes in OIS rate on the target factor: is the change in 1-year OIS rates, it is the where actual repo rate, is the expected/mean repo rate in the Bloomberg survey and \u03b5t is the path factor. To minimise the impact of other significant macroeconomic events on asset prices, changes are measured over a narrow window around policy announcements (Gurkaynak et al., 2004). The estimated target and path factors on each policy announcement day around a 60-minute window for the period January 2014-August 2024 encompassing 67 policy announcement dates, including 5 unscheduled ones, are presented in Chart IV.1.1.8 To assess the relative importance of target and path factors for movements in equity prices, BSE Sensex returns over two different, but narrow, time windows are regressed on the target and path factors: where the alternative time windows (in minutes) with . The windows thus being returns on policy day \u03b4 \u2208 {30,60} constructed span 30 minutes (i.e., 10 minutes before and 20 minutes after the policy announcement) and 60 minutes (i.e., 15 minutes before and 45 minutes after) around the policy announcement. The findings indicate that Sensex returns are affected significantly by the surprise in the future path of monetary policy (path factor), and it is stronger for the 60-minute window vis-\u00e0-vis the 30 minutes window (Table IV.1.1). As expected, a positive path factor or an expected policy tightening in the future leads to negative equity returns as equity markets price in changes in longer-term borrowing costs. The results, subscript represents changes/returns in 7 Assuming that changes in the OIS rates are in response to unanticipated changes in monetary policy and that other factors such as risk premia remain constant in these intraday windows. 8 Gupta et al., (2024) conducts a similar exercise on policy dates for the period June 2018-June 2022. b) Newey-West standard errors are presented in parentheses.

(Chart IV.13a). Amid bouts of volatility, India VIX averaged higher at around 14.8 during H1:2024-25 than 13.2 during H2:2023-24 (Chart IV.13b). Overall, the BSE Sensex gained 14.5 per cent during H1:2024-25 to close at 84,300 at end-September 2024. The broader market indices continued to outperform the benchmark Sensex, with the BSE MidCap and the BSE SmallCap index increasing by 25.5 per cent and 32.4 per cent, respectively, during H1:2024-25 turning net sellers during April and May 2024. Foreign investors, however, remained overall net hand, remained robust. Overall, DIIs and FPIs were net buyers to the tune of 0.82 lakh crore, respectively, in H1 (Chart IV.14a). In terms \u20b9 of systematic investment plan (SIP) contributions through mutual funds, monthly collections crossed the 20,000 crore mark for the first time in April 2024, followed by fresh highs in each of the subsequent months in H1 (up to August 2024). Primary market resource mobilisation in equity markets was placed market, SME companies mobilised The Indian rupee (INR) traded in a range-bound manner with a depreciating bias during the first half of 2024-25 (Chart IV.15a). The US dollar remained between April and mid-July 2024 but depreciated potential rate cut by the US Fed, which was eventually corroborated by the 50 bps rate cut by the US Fed on September 18. The unwinding of yen carry trade in early-August exacerbated volatility in global financial markets, albeit briefly. Overall, the volatility of the INR \u2013 measured by the 1-month at the money (ATM) option implied volatility \u2013 fell marginally to an average but rose in Q2, particularly for longer maturities, INR depreciated by 0.5 per cent against the US dollar, although it outperformed several EME peer currencies 1-month forward premia averaged 1.18 per cent In terms of the Reserve Bank\u2019s 40-currency real cent in H2:2023-24, while the 12-month premia rose effective exchange index, the INR appreciated by 0.1 Forward premia remained stable in Q1:2024-25 A financial conditions index (FCI) is a summary measure that encapsulates the information content in a broad array of financial variables and helps to gauge the incipient stress in financial markets. Monetary policy actions impact financial conditions through channels of monetary transmission although financial conditions often change independently of policy decisions. The FCI is, thus, a valuable input for monetary policy in so far as it measures the impact of financial variables on real activity, over and above the direct effects of monetary policy (Hatzius et al., 2010). It can, therefore, serve as a guide on the effective stance of policy (Bowe et al., 2023). An FCI for India is constructed by using twenty financial market indicators at daily frequency for the period January 1, 2012 to September 30, 2024. The chosen indicators represent five market segments, namely (i) the money market; (ii) the G-sec market; (iii) the corporate bond market; (iv) the forex market; and (v) the equity market (Table IV.2.1). The money market segment includes indicators on liquidity conditions while the G-sec market segment is represented by latent factors viz., level, slope, and curvature of the sovereign yield curve. The corporate bond market segment is captured through credit risk indicators. Finally, indicators on return and volatility of currency and equities constitute the forex and equity market segments, respectively. All indicators are factored into the index in a manner such that an increase in these indicate a tightening of financial conditions. India US 10yr yield differential USD-INR 1M ATM volatility Currency return 1M forward premia India VIX PE level relative to 2yr moving average BSE Sensex return BSE Mid-Cap return BSE Small-Cap return The FCI is computed using a dynamic factor model (DFM): \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf06(\ud835\udc3f)\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61 + \ud835\udf09\ud835\udc61 is the is the vector of financial indicators, where \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61 = \u03a8(\ud835\udc3f)\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61-1 + \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc61 underlying common factor representing the financial \ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc61 are mean-zero serially and conditions index, and uncorrelated idiosyncratic errors. \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc61 The standardized FCI along with the contribution of its constituent blocks is presented in Chart IV.2.1. The estimated FCI closely tracks the evolution of financial conditions in India over the years. The peaks in FCI are associated with major events like the taper tantrum, stress in the NBFC sector during the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) episode and the COVID-19 pandemic. The major drivers of FCI, however, vary across events. While the forex market was the key factor during the taper tantrum, domestic factors were the primary drivers during the IL&FS and COVID-19 episodes. The exceptionally easy financial condition in the aftermath of the pandemic was driven by all market segments. withdrawal of accommodation. Congenial financial conditions during this period were mainly driven by stable forex market conditions and the buoyant equity market, reflecting improved global investor confidence in India\u2019s economic outlook.

(2010). Financial Conditions Indexes: A Fresh Look After the Financial Crisis. NBER Working Paper No. 16150 Growth in bank credit remained strong in H1:2024- 25, albeit with a slowing momentum. Non food bank credit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) decelerated to 14.4 per cent (y-o-y) as on September 20, 2024 from 15.3 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.18). Across bank groups, credit growth of private sector banks (PVBs) remained higher (16.4 per cent) than that of public sector banks (PSBs) (12.9 per cent), while foreign banks\u2019 credit offtake picked up pace (Chart IV.19a). PSBs continued to account for the largest share of incremental credit, although their share declined vis-\u00e0-vis PVBs and foreign banks (Chart IV.19b). From a sectoral perspective, the overall growth (y-o-y) in bank credit was primarily driven by personal loans and services, although their share in total incremental credit moderated in H1:2024-25 (up to August) vis-\u00e0- vis the same period of the previous year10. Credit growth to the agriculture sector remained in double digits. Industrial credit growth, which was tepid during H1:2023-24, recorded an uptick in H1:2024-25 (up to August). Credit to services and personal loans segments, however, moderated, reflecting the impact of the regulatory measures11 undertaken by the Reserve Bank in November 2023 (Chart IV.20a). The share of agriculture and industry in SCBs\u2019 incremental credit offtake rose to 16.1 per cent and 9 While overall bank credit and non-food credit data are based on Section-42 return (which covers all SCBs), sectoral non-food credit data are based on sector-wise and industry-wise bank credit (SIBC) return, which covers select banks accounting for about 95 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all SCBs. Data on bank credit exclude the impact of merger of a non-bank with a bank. 10 The sectoral credit growth (y-o-y) for May 2024 is based on 27 fortnights as against the usual 26 fortnights. 11 Risk weights on bank lending to NBFCs and retail loans excluding housing, education, vehicle loans, and loans against gold and gold jewellery were increased on November 16, 2023 (https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/REGULATORYMEASURES8785E7886A044B678FB8AF2C6C051807.PDF). 16.6 per cent, respectively, in August 2024 from 14.4 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively, in the previous year. In contrast, the incremental share of services and personal loans moderated over the same period (Chart IV.20b). Credit to agriculture and allied activities registered double digit growth, improving to 17.7 per cent (y-o-y) in August 2024 from 16.5 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.20a), driven by favourable monsoon and continued Credit to industry grew by 9.8 per cent in August 2024 from 5.3 per cent a year ago, primarily driven by a pickup in offtake to large industry (Chart IV.21a). Higher credit expansion in micro, small and medium industries further supported growth in this segment (Chart IV.21b). Among the major industrial sub-sectors, credit growth to chemicals and chemical products, food processing, infrastructure, and petroleum, coal products and nuclear fuels accelerated in August 2024. Credit growth to services and personal loans segments at 15.6 per cent and 16.9 per cent, respectively, in August 2024 displayed gradual moderation (Chart IV.22a and IV.23a). Within the services sector, NBFCs were the main driver of overall growth. Increasing dependency of NBFCs on bank borrowings triggered regulatory concerns. Similarly, certain components showed higher growth in the personal loans segment, which led to concerns about incipient stress. To address the build-up of any potential risk, the Reserve Bank tightened lending norms in November 2023 as alluded to earlier. Consequently, total consumer loan growth in the sub-segments where risk weights were increased, moderated to 13.9 Note: In the case of NBFCs, a few banks have reported prepayment/repayment of their advances from some HFCs/PFIs/NBFCs, which also contributed to the decline in growth.

In tandem, growth in bank credit to NBFCs moderated to 12.2 per cent, bringing down its share to 26.9 per cent of incremental credit extended to services during the same period (Chart IV.22b). The asset quality of SCBs improved during 2024- 25 (up to June 2024), with the overall gross non- performing assets (NPA) ratio declining to 2.7 per cent in June 2024 from 3.7 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.24a). Asset quality improved across all the major sectors (Chart IV.24b). Growth in non-SLR12 investments of banks (comprising investments in CPs, bonds, debentures and shares of public and private corporates) increased to 4.8 per cent in H1:2024-25 from 4.1 per cent in H2:2023-24 (Chart IV.25a). The growth in adjusted non-food credit (i.e., non-food bank credit plus non-SLR investments by banks) was marginally lower at 14.1 per cent in Q2:2024-25 as compared to 14.4 per cent in Q2:2023- 24 (Chart IV.25b). demand and time liabilities (NDTL), up from 8.6 per cent at end-September 2023 (Chart IV.26). Excess SLR holdings provide collateral buffers to banks for availing funds under the LAF as well as wholesale funding in the TREPS and market repo segments. They are also a component of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). Excess holdings of SLR securities by SCBs as on September 6, 2024 were 8.8 per cent of their net Transmission to lending and deposit rates of banks continued in H1:2024-25, with the latter adjusting faster in the wake of persistent credit demand and the widening gap between credit and deposit growth. During H1:2024-25, the median 1-year marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) of SCBs increased by 10 bps, indicating a slightly higher cost of borrowing. During April-August 2024, the weighted average lending rates (WALRs) on fresh and outstanding rupee loans increased by 4 bps and 6 bps, respectively. In the current tightening cycle, i.e., May 2022 to August 2024, in which the policy repo rate was cumulatively increased by 250 bps, the WALR of SCBs on fresh and outstanding rupee loans increased by 190 bps and 119 bps, respectively.

Banks have increased their rates on fresh retail deposits by 21 bps during the same period. The WADTDRs on fresh and outstanding rupee deposits of SCBs increased by 243 bps and 190 bps, respectively, during May 2022 to August 2024 (Table IV.4). Bank group-wise, the transmission to WALRs on fresh rupee loans of PSBs was higher than that of PVBs, while it was lower for outstanding loans (Chart IV.27a). The lending rates of PVBs remained above those of PSBs (Chart IV.27b). The maximum pass-through to lending rates was witnessed in the case of foreign banks, reflecting their higher share of low-cost and wholesale deposits of lower maturity. Moreover, the Notes: 1.

As up liquidity turned into deficit since the latter half of April, five main and 17 fine-tuning variable rate repo (VRR) auctions were conducted, cumulatively injecting 15.5 lakh crore into the system to ease liquidity tightness in Q1:2024-2515. A 3-day VRR auction was conducted on June 28 (Reporting Friday) instead of the main operation as liquidity conditions were expected to improve significantly in the near term. As systemic liquidity turned into surplus at the beginning of July, the Reserve Bank switched to variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions to absorb surplus liquidity. Overall, 49 VRRR auctions \u2013 5 main and 44 fine-tuning operations of maturities ranging 1-7 days \u2013 were conducted during Q2 to absorb surplus liquidity (Chart IV.32). As liquidity turned into deficit in the latter half of September, the Reserve Bank conducted one main and 3 fine- 2.1 tuning VRR operations, cumulatively injecting lakh crore into the system during the second half of September to ease liquidity conditions.

As on September 20, 2024, reserve money (RM) expanded by 6.8 per cent (y-o-y) (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in CRR) as against 6.7 per cent at end-March 2024. The growth in CiC In contrast to volatile global financial markets, domestic market conditions remained stable in H1:2024-25. Money market rates evolved in tune with liquidity shifts, consistent with the monetary policy stance. Domestic long-term bond yields eased amidst an improving inflationary outlook and positive global sentiment on India\u2019s prospects. Equity market scaled new highs, mainly supported by domestic investors. The INR traded with a depreciating bias but remained among the least volatile EME currencies during H1. Monetary transmission continued with credit growth continuing to outpace deposit expansion. Going forward, the Reserve Bank will remain agile and nimble in conducting market operations to ensure financial stability while providing liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy. Global growth remains resilient. Headline inflation decelerated at a sluggish pace as sticky services prices hindered strong disinflation in goods. Most central banks tread the path of monetary policy normalisation but with measured cuts and cautious pace, while others retain their restrictive stance. Fluctuating perceptions on the monetary policy trajectory imparted volatility to global financial markets. Stubborn services inflation, high public debt, geopolitical risks, potential escalation of trade tensions, and extreme weather events pose downside risks to the global growth outlook. Global economic activity remains resilient. World trade has firmed up, propelled by strong exports from Asia. Both headline and core inflation (headline excluding food and energy) continue to decelerate, albeit at a sluggish pace, with strong disinflation in goods hindered by persistence of higher-than-average services inflation. With inflation still above target for some inflation targeting advanced economies (AEs), central banks remain cautious while unwinding their restrictive stance. Some emerging market economies (EMEs), on the other hand, that had initiated pre- emptive tightening to curb inflation persistence at elevated levels have continued to normalise their monetary policies while others retain policy rates at restrictive levels. Global financial markets remain volatile in response to fluctuating perceptions on the monetary policy trajectory and how it impacts the growth-inflation trade-off. Equity markets have broadly gained notwithstanding intermittent bouts of sharp spikes in volatility. Sovereign bond yields have softened, while the US dollar has pared strength since April 2024. Off-late, however, both sovereign bond yields and US dollar index have inched up, reversing its earlier trend. Risks to the global growth outlook remain broadly balanced. indicators for Q3:2024 point to faltering momentum in manufacturing but a durable expansion in services sector activity. In its World Economic Outlook (WEO) update of July 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) retained global growth projections at 3.2 per cent for 2024 while increasing it to 3.3 per cent for 2025.1 Amongst the AEs, the US economy grew by 3.0 per cent (quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised rates (q-o-q, saar)) in Q2:2024, faster than in Q1 (1.6 per cent) (Table V.1). This improvement was driven by consumer spending, private inventory investment, and non-residential fixed investment, while imports also increased. Labour market conditions have been easing, with the unemployment rate picking up to 4.1 per cent in September (3.8 per cent in March). The US composite Standard and Poor's (S&P) global purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) was robust at 54.0 in September 2024, though increasingly uneven as services activity exhibited solid expansion while manufacturing output declined. In 2024 so far, global economic activity has remained stable despite tight financial conditions and persistent geopolitical risks. High frequency Real GDP growth in the euro area decelerated in Q2 to 0.8 per cent (q-o-q, saar) from 1.3 per cent in Q1 due to decline in gross fixed capital formation. Labour markets remained resilient, with the unemployment rate at 6.4 per cent in August, its lowest level since the start of the euro. The Eurozone composite PMI hit a seven-month low of 49.6 in September from 1 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its Interim Economic Outlook (September 2024) revised up global growth forecast for 2024 by 10 bps to 3.2 per cent from May 2024 projections and retained it at 3.2 per cent for 2025. Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted, annualised rate (q-o-q, saar) slower upturns reflected in both the sectors. Japan\u2019s GDP rebounded strongly and grew by 2.9 per cent in Q2:2024 (q-o-q, saar) vis-\u00e0-vis a contraction of 2.4 per cent in Q1, driven by robust private consumption and capital expenditure. The composite PMI (au Jibun Bank) remained elevated at 52.0 in September following a 15-month high of 52.9 in August, driven by resilient services activity. Amongst EMEs, China\u2019s real GDP moderated to 4.7 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2024 from 5.3 per cent in Q1, amidst continued downturn in the real estate sector and tepid consumer demand. Secondary and tertiary industries also witnessed a slowdown in the second quarter. Nonetheless, the economy grew by 5.0 per cent in the first half of 2024 \u2013 propelled by monetary easing and regulatory relaxations for the real estate sector \u2013 meeting the official target of 5.0 per cent for 2024 so far. The composite PMI (Caixin) posted 50.3 in September, down from 51.2 in August due to slower expansions in both manufacturing and services sectors. P: Projection.

GDP growth in the UK, despite moderating from 2.8 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q1:2024, remained resilient at 1.8 per cent in Q2 supported by increases in gross capital formation, government consumption and household spending. The unemployment rate increased to 4.3 per cent in April-July 2024 from the average of 4.0 per cent in 2023. The UK composite PMI posted 52.6 in September, down from 53.8 in August with Among other major EMEs, Brazil\u2019s GDP growth accelerated to 3.3 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2024 vis-\u00e0- vis 2.5 per cent in Q1, driven by expansion in the services and industrial sectors. The labour market, however, remained tight as the unemployment rate continued to decline to 6.6 per cent in August 2024, its lowest level since 2014. The composite PMI was up from an eight-month low of 52.9 in August to 55.2 in September due to quicker upturn in services activity and a renewed expansion in factory production. The South African economy grew at a tardy pace of 0.3 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2024 (0.5 per cent in Q1) as financial industry expansion was offset by the decline in the transport, storage and communication industry. The composite PMI for South Africa rose from 50.5 in August to 51.0 in September signalling improved demand conditions. The Russian economy grew by 4.1 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2024 (5.4 per cent in Q1), partly driven by higher military and defence spending. The composite PMI, however, posted 49.4 in September, down from 52.1 in August. The ASEAN2 economies recorded resilient growth in Q2:2024 amidst higher new orders and increased activity. Southeast Asian economies are projected to grow at a robust pace3, driven by improved domestic and external demand conditions, stable prices, and increased tourism-related activities. In Q3:2024 so far, growth has decelerated marginally but remains healthy due to positive sentiments on future output amidst persistent price pressures. Among the BRICS economies barring South Africa, GDP growth for 2024 is projected to moderate marginally (Table V.2). The inflation scenario in these countries is expected to improve in 2024 for all, barring Russia where inflation has risen due to demand-supply imbalance. China is facing weak rise in prices amidst a property slump and subdued consumer confidence. Turning to high frequency indicators, the OECD composite leading indicators (CLIs) for September 2024 showed that most economies remained above the long-term trend (Chart V.1a). The global composite PMI remained in expansion zone for the eleventh consecutive month in September at 52.0 as strong expansion in the services sector offset weakness in manufacturing (Chart V.1b). The global manufacturing PMI, however, plunged to an eleven-month low of 48.8 in September as output, new orders and employment contracted. Global merchandise trade volume grew for the fourth consecutive month in July 2024, recording an expansion of 1.7 per cent (y-o-y). EMEs remained the major driver for the sixth consecutive quarter in Q2:2024, while trade volume continued to contract in AEs (Chart V.2a).

The Freightos Baltic Global Index \u2013 the global ocean freight container pricing index that measures 40-feet container prices \u2013 remained elevated on y-o-y basis in September 2024 as attacks on commercial shipping continued in the Red Sea trade route (Chart V.2b). These attacks necessitated rerouting of maritime trade from the Suez Canal to around the Cape of Good Hope, leading to longer transit time, rise in freight costs and an uptick in war-risk premia. In September, however, the Freightos Baltic Global Index fell on m-o-m basis as demand moderated. Global trade value continued to expand in Q1:2024, with around 1 per cent growth in merchandise trade (q-o-q) on the back of higher exports from China, India, and the US.4 Trade in green energy and Artificial Intelligence related products increased strongly in Q1. The latest WTO trade barometer (September 2024) indicates that global merchandise trade volume continued to grow in Q3:2024. The global trade outlook for 2024 remains positive; however, persistent geopolitical tensions, rising shipping costs and emerging industrial policies could impact trade patterns. According to the IMF's WEO update of July 2024, global trade volume is estimated to grow by 3.1 per cent and 3.4 per cent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, with faster expansion in trade in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). end of the month and early June due to a significant drop in crude oil prices. Prices softened by 0.6 per cent (q-o-q) in Q3 due to moderating energy and metal prices amidst weak demand from China (Chart V.3a). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global food prices edged up by 2.0 per cent (q-o-q) in Q2 and by 1.4 per cent in Q3, primarily due to increase in the prices of vegetable oil, dairy and meat, though partly offset by decline in sugar and cereals prices (Chart V.3b). In Q2:2024, global commodity prices as measured by the Bloomberg commodity price index remained volatile but maintained the levels attained in Q1. Gains recorded in May were corrected towards the Crude oil prices have moderated since the April 2024 MPR. Brent prices hovered above US$ 90 per barrel in the first half of April following heightened geopolitical tensions, but corrected over the rest of the period in Q2 (till early June) in the wake of weak demand and increased oil inventories. Crude oil prices fell to a low of US$ 76 per barrel in early June after the meeting of OPEC+, wherein eight members agreed to reverse some \u201cvoluntary\u201d cuts from October 2024.5 Thereafter, with escalation of geopolitical tensions and larger than expected decline in US crude oil inventory, prices rose for a short while before again moderating in July over demand concerns, fuelled by lower-than- expected Chinese GDP growth and signs of cooling US labour market. Crude prices firmed up in August with tensions escalating in the Middle East, however, it began to soften in early September, prompting the postponement of the scheduled unwinding of the \u201cvoluntary\u201d production cuts by eight OPEC+ members from October to December 2024. Notwithstanding the announcement, prices dropped below $70 per barrel on September 10 \u2013 the first time since December 2021 \u2013 but recouped some losses thereafter. Natural gas prices (according to the World Bank\u2019s natural gas index) increased in Q2 and Q3 due to unplanned outages in Europe and increased demand for power generation in the US (Chart V.3c). record highs buoyed by improved odds of the US Fed\u2019s rate cut, renewed weakening of the US dollar and safe haven flight (Chart V.3d). Consumer price inflation grudgingly eased further as sticky services prices posed a drag on the pace of disinflation. Nonetheless, inflation is already close to pre-pandemic levels for the median EMDEs owing to declining energy prices.6 Stronger nominal wage growth in some countries and escalating Base metal prices peaked in May, fuelled by economic stimulus undertaken by China, the largest consumer of base metals, but corrected later over a muted demand outlook. Overall, the prices of most base metals firmed up in Q2 and continued to rise in Q3 as positive sentiments from Chinese stimulus measures overwhelmed negative sentiments emanating from muted demand outlook. Gold prices (q-o-q) rallied in Q2 and Q3 by 5.5 per cent and 13.9 per cent, respectively, with prices surpassing their record highs in every successive month. Yellow metal prices surged in April over a potential escalation in geopolitical tensions that triggered safe-haven demand. Prices moderated briefly as tensions eased but firmed up again in May above April levels due to weakening US dollar and softening treasury yields. Prices corrected in late May and June over weak seasonal demand and a stronger US dollar, but rebounded in Q3 to touch P: Projection. Notes: 1.

The same were announced to be unwound gradually over the following 12 months beginning in October. However, besides unwinding of these \u201cvoluntary\u201d cuts, OPEC+ also announced extension of deep cuts in oil production to support prices till the end of 2025. 6 As per IMF's WEO Update released on July 16, 2024. trade tensions pose upside risks to the disinflation momentum, causing monetary policy to remain restrictive. Notwithstanding the decline, inflation still ranges above the target in some inflation-targeting economies. According to the IMF's WEO Update, July 2024, global inflation is projected to fall from 6.7 per cent in 2023 to 5.9 per cent in 2024 and further to 4.4 per cent in 2025 (Table V.3). In the US, headline and core CPI inflation (y-o-y) decelerated from 3.5 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively, in March 2024 to 2.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively, in August. Inflation, in terms of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index \u2013 the Fed\u2019s preferred measure \u2013 softened at a tardy pace from 2.8 per cent in March to 2.2 per cent in August (Chart V.4a), while core PCE inflation eased In the Euro area, CPI inflation moderated from 2.4 per cent in April to 1.8 per cent in September. Core inflation (inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco) remained stable at 2.7 per cent in September (same as in April), with a mild uptick during May- August. In the UK, CPI headline inflation decelerated sharply by 100 bps from 3.2 per cent in March to 2.2 per cent in August, with core inflation declining from 4.2 per cent to 3.6 per cent. In Japan, CPI inflation (all items less fresh food), the Bank of Japan (BoJ)\u2019s inflation target metric, eased briefly during March and April but started firming up since May. In August, inflation at 2.8 per cent was well above the BoJ\u2019s target of 2 per cent. Core inflation (inflation excluding both Notes: 1. For India, core CPI, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups 'food and beverages' and 'fuel and light' from the headline CPI. fresh food and energy), however, declined to 2.0 per cent in August from 2.4 per cent in April. Amongst major EMEs, CPI inflation edged up in Brazil to 4.2 per cent in August from 3.9 per cent in March 2024 (Chart V.4c). In Russia, it accelerated from 7.7 per cent to 9.1 per cent over the same period due to western sanctions and an overheating economy. In South Africa, however, CPI inflation receded to 4.4 per cent in August from 5.3 per cent in March. China recorded positive inflation during March (0.1 per cent) to August (0.6 per cent) after it exited deflation in February. Similar to AEs, core inflation is also receding, albeit grudgingly in EMEs (Chart V.4d). Following and highly synchronised monetary policy tightening to counter multi-decadal high inflation in 2022-23, the strength and credibility of central bank policies were tested as they tried to curb inflation without hampering growth, necessitating a revamp of the monetary policy operating frameworks of some countries in the context of changing dynamics of policy trade-offs (Box V.1). In 2024, particularly during Q2 and Q3, monetary policy cycles diverged as central banks across AEs and EMEs responded to their own evolving growth-inflation dynamics. While continuing to emphasise on caution While successfully navigating through the two black swan events of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Europe, central banks worldwide had to quickly change gears from providing large-scale stimulus that resuscitated economic activity to battling decadal-high inflation to restore price stability. This prompted central banks to undertake synchronised and aggressive interest rate hikes in decades accompanied by ultra-hawkish stances even as they started to taper their bloated balance sheets. to the ECB, the RBA also planned to shift from a system of excess to ample reserves in April 2024 (Kent, 2024). According to the RBA, the move towards ample reserves, that lies somewhere between the current \u2018floor\u2019 system with excess reserves and the pre-pandemic \u2018corridor\u2019 system with scarce reserves, eliminates (i) the need for precise estimation of demand for reserves; (ii) minimises risk of volatile money markets; and (iii) is more resilient to future balance sheet expansions during periods of financial stress. Monetary policy operating frameworks underwent significant refinements in two major systemic countries \u2013 the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The ECB, faced with mounting post-pandemic the inflation pressures, imperative of moving from abundant excess liquidity to one of less ample liquidity. In response, it announced a new operational framework effective September 2024, wherein the main refinancing operations (MRO) rate is adjusted and anchored at 15 bps (as opposed to 50 bps earlier) above the deposit facility rate (DFR) while the rate on marginal lending facility (MLF) remains at 25 bps above the MRO rate (EP, 2024). This adjustment would retain the asymmetric corridor but narrow the corridor width to 40 bps from 75 bps, which would deter upward deviations and contain volatility as rate gets anchored closer to the DFR (Chart V.1.1) (ECB, 2024).7 Analogous recognised There are also instances of countries shifting to simpler mandates for monetary policy for better management of trade-offs. In February 2024, the RBA announced a switch towards a dual mandate of price stability and full employment with the clarification that, in practice, the dual mandate is not a substantial departure from the status quo (PoA, 2024). In this regard, the deleted \u2018third goal\u2019 of contributing to Australian people\u2019s economic prosperity and welfare will henceforth be an \u201coverarching objective\u201d, rather than a policy objective for monetary policy. On a similar but more focussed move, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) highlighted the necessity for a more precise and focused monetary policy target in June 2023. Recognising that the shift to a dual mandate in 2018 was a mistake, it recommended a shift back to the single mandate in order to remain focussed on price stability 7 Additionally, two new instruments \u2013 a structural portfolio of assets and long-term refinancing operations \u2013 will be introduced going forward for ECB. and enhance its policy credibility. The RBNZ amended the Remit for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in December 2023, recommending that the MPC remain solely focussed on achieving an inflation target of 1-3 per cent over the medium-term, with added emphasis on the 2 per cent mid-point (RBNZ, 2023). decades, despite undertaking surge in inflation led to a rise in inflation expectations and, therefore, the BoJ made a pivotal decision to exit its negative interest rate policy in March 2024, discontinuing In the case of Japan, the pandemic served as a catalyst to emerge from the deflationary environment of several QQE with YCC (Chart V.1.2) (Kazuo, 2024). It removed the long-standing target of controlling the 10-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) rate and started targeting the uncollateralised overnight call rate. It also embarked on As countries prioritise inflation control, the role of central prominence. With a view towards enhancing transparency and ensuring effective policy communication, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced changes in its monetary policy operating framework in June 2024 and placed greater emphasis on price-based regulatory measures involving interest rates (Gongsheng, 2024). The PBoC indicated that the seven-day reverse repo rate will and consequentially, the roles of other rates on monetary policy instruments with different tenures may soften. It also pointed out that the existing corridor of the standing lending facility (SLF) acting as the ceiling and the rate on excess reserves (ERR) being the floor is relatively wide and may be narrowed, going forward. PBOC announced a new cash management tool of temporary overnight repo (ORR) and reverse repo operations (ORRR), with the interest rates fixed at the seven-day repo rate minus 20 bps and plus 50 bps, respectively (Chart V.1.3). The PBoC also intends to expand its policy toolkit by including the purchase and sale of China government bonds in the secondary market. Going ahead, the changes in the framework will be tested and reviewed in response to evolving macro-economic developments. be the central bank\u2019s main short-term operational rate and data dependence for future decisions, central banks of major systemic AEs embarked on policy pivots even as some others have paused. Given their pre-emptive tightening at the onset of the inflation surge, some EME central banks continued with policy normalisation while few others continued with the restrictive stance. The US Fed initiated a pause in policy tightening in September 2023 and continued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25-5.50 per cent in all its subsequent meetings. In September 2024, however, it lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 bps to 4.75-5.00 per cent (Chart V.5a). As per the Summary of Economic Projections released in the September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants expected the target range for the federal fund rates to be at 4.25-4.50 per cent by end 2024 and at 3.25-3.50 per cent by end 2025, indicating a further 50 bps rate cut in the remaining part of 2024 and 100 bps rate cut in 2025. The Fed also continued with its balance sheet normalisation policy. by 25 bps in June 2024, marking its first cut in the current easing cycle. It again announced a cut in its deposit facility rate (DFR) by 25 bps in September after keeping it unchanged in July. It reiterated that it would continue to remain data-dependant to determine the appropriate level and duration of restriction. Besides, (APP) portfolio continues to shrink as principal payments from maturing securities are no longer reinvested. The Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) portfolio is also set to decline by \u20ac7.5 billion per month, on average, with reinvestments ceasing entirely by the end of 2024. The Bank of England (BoE) continued with its status quo stance initiated in September 2023, followed by first cut of 25 bps in August as inflation risks abated, but paused in its September meeting. The BoE indicated that a gradual approach in removing policy restraint is warranted, emphasising that monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks for inflation to return sustainably to the 2 per cent target dissipate further. After continuing with the pause that ECB initiated in October 2023, it lowered its three key interest rates 8 The Bank of Iceland cut its policy rate by 25 bps on October 02, 2024. the Bank of Korea maintained status quo in all their meetings during Q2 and Q3 of 2024. After keeping its policy rate unchanged since September 2023, the Bank of Canada reduced it by 25 bps each in all its meetings starting June 2024. The RBNZ cut its official cash rate by 25 bps in August 2024, following a pause since July 2023. The Sveriges Riksbank slashed its policy rate by 25 bps each in May, August and September 2024 meetings, with a pause in the month of June. The Swiss National Bank also lowered its policy rate by 25 bps in its June and September meetings. The Czech National Bank reduced its key rate by 50 bps each in both May and June meetings and by 25 bps in its August and September meetings. In contrast, the BoJ raised its key rate by 15 bps in July, following a period of status quo in April and June. Moreover, the BoJ announced its plan to taper its outright purchase of JGBs at a predictable pace of 400 billion yen each quarter, reaching around 3 trillion yen by January- March 2026. The BoJ, however, maintained status quo in its September meeting. In the BRICS economies, the Banco Central do Brasil, continued to maintain its accommodative stance that started in August 2023 by cutting its Selic rate by 25 bps in May 2024, but paused thereafter in the months of June and July. In September, however, it pivoted by raising the Selic rate by 25 bps due to emerging upside risks to inflation. The South African Reserve Bank cut its repo rate by 25 bps in September 2024 for the first time after keeping it unchanged in May and July meetings. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) reduced the one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) by 10 bps in July after keeping it unchanged in Q2:2024. It reduced the one-year Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF) rate by 20 bps in July and 30 bps in September. In September, it also announced a slew of stimulus measures to support the economy, recoup the housing sector and restore market confidence including reduction in reserve requirement ratio by 50 bps and seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 bps to 1.5 per cent. The Bank of Russia (BoR) maintained status quo in Q2:2024 but increased its policy rate by 200 bps and 100 bps in July and September, respectively, of 2024 as inflation remained elevated much above the target. Among Asian EMEs, the Bank of Thailand kept its benchmark rate unchanged in Q2 and Q3 of 2024. The Bank Indonesia cut its key rate by 25 bps in September 2024 following a hike in April while pausing in intermittent meetings, while the central bank of Philippines cut its policy rate by 25 bps in August 2024 after maintaining status quo in Q2. In Latin America, the central bank of Mexico maintained the policy rate in Q2 but announced two consecutive rate cuts of 25 bps each in August and September after the first rate cut in March 2024. The central bank of Colombia continued with monetary policy easing by paring its benchmark rate by 50 bps in each of its April, June, July and September meetings. Chile cumulatively lowered its policy rate by 175 bps to 5.50 per cent during April-September 2024 with an intermittent pause in July. Peru cut its reference rate by 25 bps each in April, May, August and September meetings but maintained status quo in its June and July meetings. Among European EMEs, Hungary lowered its policy rate by 50 bps each in its April and May meetings and by 25 bps in June, July and September while maintaining a pause in August. Poland maintained a pause in Q2 and Q3 of 2024 (Chart V.5b). Global financial markets remained in a state of flux during Q2 and Q3, responding somewhat unexpectedly to changing perceptions on the monetary policy trajectory and data releases.9 Markets turned buoyant during May-September 2024 as expectation of rate 9 Bauer, M.D., C.E. Pflueger, and A. Sundaram (2024), \u201cChanging Perceptions and Post-Pandemic Monetary Policy,\u201d unpublished manuscript, FRBKC Jackson Hole conference. cuts gained momentum. Notwithstanding the gains, equity markets retreated intermittently since the last MPR \u2013 in April over continued restrictive monetary policy; in the beginning of August over a confluence of factors, including underwhelming data releases for the US and landmark rate hike by Japan; and in early September over increased risk-off sentiment amidst data releases. Overall, bond yields have moderated since the last MPR while the US dollar has pared gains. Consequently, EME currencies broadly appreciated in Q3:2024. Equity markets, in terms of the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) world index, gained 8.7 per cent since end-March, reflecting gains in both AEs and EMEs, with recurrent episodes of volatility (Chart V.6a). Among AEs, the US S&P 500 shed gains in April as strong consumer demand and high PCE inflation rekindled concerns about \u2018higher for longer\u2019 interest rates. It, however, rallied starting end-April till mid- July amidst easing geopolitical tensions and increased expectations of a rate cut over moderating inflation prints. Thereafter, market sentiment turned sour with incoming data sparking recessionary fears in the US on top of disorderly unwinding of yen carry trade consequent to the BoJ\u2019s rate hike. After undergoing a sharp dip in late July and early August, US stock markets rebounded in August as investors moved back to riskier assets on dovish guidance from the BoJ and abatement of recessionary fears. In the first week of September, however, market underwent another correction upon the release of below expectations PMI data and labour market indicators but soon rallied overhauling the previous loss. Overall, the US S&P index rose by 9.7 per cent during April-September 2024. European stocks underperformed as bullish sentiments in other markets attracted investors interest. The UK\u2019s stock indices modestly tracked the US markets in Q2, performing well following the Labour party\u2019s landslide electoral performance but relatively underperformed in Q3. The Japanese market reflected domestic factors exhibiting a sharp correction post the BoJ\u2019s rate hike causing yen appreciation and raising risks on exporters\u2019 earnings\u2019 outlook. EME equities gained since end-March, tracking global cues and lower domestic inflation prints (Chart V.6b). Chinese stocks, that were losing ground amidst flagging economic activity and the persistent downturn in real estate, rebounded sharply In tandem with Q1:2024, sovereign bond yields across major AEs continued to harden in April in response to expectations of a firmer future path of interest rates, sensitivity to rising fiscal risks and tight liquidity conditions. Beginning May, however, yields softened as incoming data signaled an improving inflation outlook for the US, raising the odds for an imminent rate cut. Illustratively, the US 10-year treasury yield rose by 48 bps in April but shed 78 bps between May-August over evolving perceptions of rate cuts. Subsequently, yields fell precipitously in August and early September, remaining below the 4 per cent mark in response to the release of underwhelming high- frequency indicators. Since mid-September, however, yields hardened as market expectations of the Federal Reserve rate cut for November shifted from 50 bps to 25 bps. Also, the yield curve inversion i.e. negative 10- minus 2-year spread that had persisted since July 2022, has reversed to become positive in September 2024. The UK 10-year bond yield broadly tracked the US market while the German 10-year yield softened in response to the ECB\u2019s rate cut actions and forward guidance. Yield on 10-year JGBs rose by 33 bps between April and July, pushed up by the BoJ\u2019s policy rate hike, including tapering of their bond purchase programme, but softened by 20 bps since August on a dovish stance (Chart V.7a). Bond yields in several EMEs exhibited a softening bias, driven by easing of domestic financial conditions as well as global cues (Chart V.7b). Bond yields in Brazil, however, hardened till July as investors trimmed their portfolios but remained volatile thereafter. In the currency markets, the US dollar remained range bound in Q2:2024, with an upward bias over changing bouts of optimism about policy easing and intermittent escalation of geopolitical and electoral risks increasing safe haven demand. Cooling labour market conditions, easing inflation and flagging high- frequency indicators of economic growth, however, led to a policy pivot by the Fed, causing a depreciation of the US dollar in Q3:2024 (Chart V.8a). However, in late September the dollar index, changed its course upon the release of better-than-expected labour market data. These movements were mirrored in the EME currencies, exacerbated by swings in capital flows (Chart V.8b). The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index remained rangebound in Q2:2024 but rose by Global growth remains resilient though flaring geopolitical tensions, flagging recovery in China, and extreme weather events pose downside risks to the outlook. Inflation remains vulnerable to in services disinflation, easing weak progress financial conditions, high public debt, strong wage growth, potential escalation of trade tensions and geoeconomic fragmentation. Even as most nations tread the path of policy normalisation, they remain cautious on rate cuts and the level of restrictiveness. Greater uncertainty about the evolving policy path is reflected in financial markets, which are buoyant yet volatile, reacting sharply to policy changes and economic data releases. Although prospects for EMEs are improving, they remain susceptible to external geopolitical risks and evolving financial conditions in advanced economies. ", "file3": "The outlook for domestic economic activity remains resilient on the back of strong domestic demand and improved macroeconomic fundamentals. Volatile food prices interrupt the path of disinflation and cloud the inflation outlook. Geopolitical hostilities, volatile global financial markets and climate shocks are the key risks to the outlook. Monetary policy remains focused on aligning inflation with the target to pave the path for sustained growth in the medium-term. The global economy has remained surprisingly resilient despite repeated and overlapping shocks and unprecedented monetary tightening. Growth in the US and several major emerging market economies (EMEs) has held up better than expected. Sectorally, manufacturing activity has remained subdued, but services have exhibited strength. Headline inflation has come down across countries although the descent in core and services inflation has been slow amidst continuing tightness in labour markets. Major central banks in advanced economies (AEs) have kept policy rates on hold to ensure the aligning of inflation with targets. Incoming data on the economic outlook and evolving expectations about monetary policy\u2019s trajectory in AEs reverberated through global financial markets imparting high volatility. A faster-than-expected decline in inflation fuelled expectations of an early reversal in the US monetary policy cycle, leading to a sharp correction in sovereign bond yields in November and December 2023. Yields have, however, hardened since the beginning of 2024 as central bank communication pushed back on market exuberance related to the magnitude and pace of monetary policy easing. Following the correction seen in Q3:2023 (July-September), global equity markets posted strong gains in November-December, primarily in AEs. The US dollar (US$) depreciated to a 6-month low at end- December but recovered subsequently on stronger- than-expected US economic data. Crude oil prices declined during October-December 2023 on slowing global demand and improved supply from countries outside of organization of the petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) but recovered thereafter in the wake of supply disruptions in key shipping routes and extension of production cuts by OPEC plus through June 2024. Food prices eased with the decline in prices of cereals, meat and vegetable oils, although sugar prices have firmed up. Turning to the domestic economy, the second advance estimates (SAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) placed real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2023-24 at 7.6 per cent, underpinned by strong investment activity. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) expanded by 6.9 per cent in 2023-24, with manufacturing and services sectors turning out to be the key drivers. Real GDP growth for Q3:2023-24 was placed at 8.4 per cent, outpacing consensus forecasts by a wide margin, underpinned by strong investment and an improvement in private consumption. Headline CPI inflation moderated to 5.3 per cent in October 2023-February 2024 from an average of 5.5 per cent in H1:2023-24. Sporadic food price shocks continued to impart significant volatility to the inflation trajectory, with headline inflation rising sharply in November and December 2023 due to a spike in vegetable prices. Core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) has, however, been on a steadily declining path. In February 2024, it fell to 3.4 per cent, among the lowest prints in the current CPI series (2012=100), driven by both core goods and services components. With the cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points (bps) undertaken during May 2022-February 2023 working its way through the economy, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent through H2 and remained resolute in its commitment to align inflation with the target, keeping in mind the objective of growth. When the MPC met in October 2023, global growth and trade were losing momentum, inflation was easing gradually but remained well above targets in major economies. Concerns about higher for longer interest rates were keeping financial conditions tight and imparting volatility to global financial markets. Domestically, CPI headline inflation rose sharply in July 2023 on the back of a spike in vegetable prices while core inflation softened. The projection of CPI inflation for 2023-24 was retained at 5.4 per cent as the spurt in vegetable prices was expected to be transitory. Domestic economic activity was showing resilience despite external headwinds. The real GDP growth projection for 2023-24 was retained at 6.5 per cent. The MPC observed that the unprecedented food price shocks were impinging on the evolving trajectory of inflation and that recurring incidence of such overlapping shocks could impart generalisation and persistence. Accordingly, the MPC unanimously decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 and, by a majority of 5-1, voted to remain focused on the stance of withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. At the time of the December 2023 meeting, receding global inflation was engendering expectations of a reversal in the monetary policy cycle in AEs. Market sentiments improved amidst declining sovereign bond yields, a depreciating US dollar and strengthening global equity markets. In India, CPI headline inflation had fallen to 4.9 per cent (October 2023 print) from an average of 6.4 per cent during the previous quarter (July-September 2023). Furthermore, core inflation had moderated to levels last seen in Q4:2019-20. Domestic economic activity exhibited resilience, with real GDP growing by 7.6 per cent in Q2:2023-24, driven by robust investment and government consumption. The projection of real GDP growth for 2023-24 was revised up to 7.0 per cent while that of inflation was retained at 5.4 per cent. The MPC observed that recurring food price shocks were impeding the ongoing disinflation process and monetary policy needed to remain actively disinflationary to ensure anchoring of inflation expectations and fuller transmission. Against this backdrop, the MPC unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent and voted with a 5-1 majority to continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. In the run up to the February 2024 meeting, headline CPI inflation had picked up to 5.7 per cent in December 2023, led primarily by an increase in vegetable price inflation, even as deflation in fuel prices deepened. Core inflation had softened to a four-year low of 3.8 per cent in December. Assuming a normal monsoon, CPI inflation was projected to decline to 4.5 per cent in 2024-25 from 5.4 per cent in 2023-24. Domestic economic activity was strengthening, with the first advance estimates (FAE) released by the NSO placing year-on-year (y-o-y) GDP growth at 7.3 per cent for 2023-24, underpinned by investment activity. Real GDP growth was projected at 7.0 per cent for 2024-25. The MPC noted that considerable uncertainty prevailed on the food price outlook from the possibility of adverse weather events. Upside risks to inflation also emanated from geopolitical developments and their impact on supply chains, volatility in international financial markets and uncertainty around commodity prices. The MPC decided by a majority of 5-1 to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent while retaining the stance of withdrawal of accommodation. demand amidst weak manufacturing activity and easing demand for transportation fuels as well as intensifying hostilities in the Middle-East, deep outages, international crude prices moved higher from mid-December reaching an average close to US$ 85 per barrel in March.

Global growth is expected to increase marginally to 3.2 per cent in 2025 (Chart I.2). Global trade growth (goods and services combined) is projected to accelerate from 0.4 per cent in 2023 to 3.3 per cent in 2024 and further to 3.6 per cent in 2025.

Inflation is projected to decline in most regions in 2024 \u2013 more Emerging market and developing economies Emerging market and developing economies witnessed a sustained decline (Chapter II). In the March 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey1, both the three months and one year ahead median inflation expectations of urban households decreased by 20 bps vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round. Concomitantly, the proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate decreased for both horizons vis- \u00e0-vis the previous round (Chart I.3). The distributional characteristics of inflation expectations contain useful forward-looking information about future inflation (Box I.1). e t a r n o i t a l f n I f o n o i t r o p o r P Manufacturing firms polled in the January-March 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expect easing in cost pressures from raw materials as well as selling prices in Q1:2024-25 Households\u2019 inflation expectations are an important driver of consumption, savings and wage-setting behaviour. Given the innate heterogeneity, higher order moments of its distribution have useful forward-looking information about inflation, especially during regime shifts (Reis, 2021; Adrian, 2023). The distributional characteristics of inflation expectations are examined by partitioning the period January 2010 to January 2024 into three regimes, based on the breaks in headline inflation.2 This analysis suggests that the distribution was marked by low dispersion and negative skew during the high inflation episode of January 2010- r e P ( Y o Y s t n e d n o p s e R f o n o i t r o p o r P 1 The Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 (18 cities in the previous rounds) and the results of the March 2024 round are based on responses from 6,083 households. 2 Unit level data on one year ahead inflation expectations from the survey of households conducted by the Reserve Bank has been used.

This model\u2019s estimates suggest that median and mean of household expectations are slow- moving indicators and are not significant in predicting one year ahead inflation. On the other hand, measures of dispersion \u2013 standard deviation and interquartile range \u2013 are significant with a negative sign, suggesting that higher disagreement among households is associated with lower inflation. When inflation falls from its peak, a larger variance is associated with decreasing inflation, as informed households reduce their expectations early and the mass of the distribution follows with a lag (Marques et al., 2023). Skewness is also significant with a negative sign, as expected (Table I.1.1). where, \u03c0t +12 = c + \u03b2mt + \u03b3\u03c0t + \u03b2Xt +12 + \u03b5t July 2014, i.e., households\u2019 inflation expectations were elevated and concentrated in a narrow band, with very few respondents expecting low inflation (Charts I.1.1 and I.1.2). With the adoption of flexible inflation targeting (FIT), the distribution became more dispersed and symmetric during August 2014-September 2019, with more households expecting lower inflation and diversity of expectations rising.

Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in March 2024 expected headline CPI inflation to moderate from 5.4 per cent in Q3:2023-24 to 5.1 per cent in Q4, 5.0-3.8 per cent in H1:2024-25, and 4.8-4.6 per cent in H2 (Chart I.5a and Table I.3).5 They expected core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and beverages, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, and fuel and light) at 3.4 per cent in Q4:2023-24 and Q1:2024- 25, increasing progressively to 3.7 per cent in Q2, 4.1 per cent in Q3, and 4.3 per cent in Q4. Their 5-year ahead inflation expectations remained unchanged at 4.7 per cent, while their 10-year ahead inflation expectations declined by 20 bps to 4.3 per cent in the March 2024 round from the previous round (Chart I.5b). Looking ahead, the outlook for inflation will be contingent largely on the evolving food inflation dynamics. Rabi sowing has exceeded last year\u2019s levels, but pulses have witnessed a decline. According to the second advance estimates, the production of cereals, pulses and oilseeds has trailed last year\u2019s level. Water reservoir levels remain significantly below the level of last year and of the decadal average. Vegetable prices are undergoing seasonal correction unevenly. The continuing pass-through of monetary policy actions and stance, on the other hand, is keeping core inflation subdued. Adverse weather events and continuing geopolitical hostilities, however, remain the key risks. Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from time-series and structural models6, CPI inflation is projected to average 4.5 per cent in 2024-25 \u2013 4.9 per cent in Q1, 3.8 per cent in Q2, 4.6 per cent in Q3 and 4.5 per cent in Q4, with risks evenly balanced (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2024-25 are 3.2\u20135.8 per cent and 2.5\u20136.5 per cent, respectively. For 2025-26, assuming a normal monsoon and no further exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will average 4.1 per 5 45 panellists participated in the March 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of professional forecasters. 6 John, Joice, Deepak Kumar, Asish Thomas George, Pratik Mitra, Muneesh Kapur and Michael Debabrata Patra (2023), \u201cA Recalibrated Quarterly Projection Model (QPM 2.0) for India\u201d, Reserve Bank of India Bulletin, February. e t a r n o i t a l f n I cent, in a range of 3.9\u20134.3 per cent.

Credit growth of scheduled commercial banks Combined gross fiscal deficit (per cent of GDP) These baseline forecasts are subject to several upside and downside risks. The upside risks emanate from persistent food price pressures from extreme weather- related disturbances; an escalation in geopolitical hostilities which could further aggravate supply disruptions; increased volatility in prices of key commodities, particularly crude oil; and a larger pass- through of input cost pressures to output prices as demand gains strength. The downside risks emanate from an early resolution of geopolitical conflicts; a pronounced slowdown in the global demand with further easing of global commodity prices; and an improvement in supply responses of key primary commodities.

Escalating flashpoints choking arterial routes of global trade, and volatile global financial conditions, however, impart uncertainty to the outlook. Turning to the key messages from forward-looking surveys, consumer confidence of urban households (the current situation index) improved further in the March 2024 survey round vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round, reaching closer to the neutral level on the back of improved perceptions on general economic conditions and the employment situation. Consumers\u2019 future outlook\u2014for the year ahead\u2014continued in optimistic territory and registered a new peak since the onset of the pandemic, propelled by improvement in all parameters (Chart I.7).7 In the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey of January-March 2024, manufacturing firms were optimistic on the business outlook during Q1:2024- 25, albeit with waning sentiments from the previous infrastructure I.8a). Services and round companies remained upbeat on the overall business situation in Q1:2024-25, though with some moderation in sentiments for the latter (Charts I.8b and I.8c). Recent surveys by other agencies generally reported sequential improvement in business expectations relative I.4). Manufacturing and services firms in the latest PMI surveys exhibited optimism for the year ahead. Professional forecasters polled in the March 2024 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey expected real GDP growth at 6.0 per cent in Q4:2023-24, 6.7 per cent in H1:2024-25, and 6.6-6.8 per cent in H2 (Chart I.9 and Table I.3). Overall, the outlook for growth is improving on the back of domestic drivers of demand, although persisting uncertainties on the global front pose risks to the outlook. Taking into account the baseline assumptions, survey indicators and model forecasts, real GDP growth is expected at 7.0 per cent in 2024- 25 \u2013 7.1 per cent in Q1; 6.9 per cent in Q2; and 7.0 per 7 The Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 (13 cities in the previous rounds) and the results of the March 2024 round are based on responses from 6,083 respondents. r e P ( n o i t a u t i S s s e n i s u B l l a r e v O r e P ( n o i t a u t i S s s e n i s u B l l a r e v O cent each in Q3 and Q4 - with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path (Chart I.10 and Table I.3). For 2025-26, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 7.0 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 6.7-7.4 per cent. There are upside and downside risks to this baseline growth path. The upsides emanate from a stronger growth in the manufacturing and services sectors sustained by strong domestic demand; upbeat business optimism; accelerated private investment spurred by government\u2019s continued capex push; an early resolution of geopolitical conflicts; faster for Q4:2023-24, and the rest pertain to Q3:2023-24.

On the contrary, further escalation in geopolitical tensions and geoeconomic fragmentation; unexpected spurts in global commodity prices; increased volatility in international financial markets; deceleration in global trade and demand; and frequent weather-related disturbances due to climate change pose downside risks to the baseline growth path. forward. The escalation in geopolitical tensions in West Asia hampering shipping through the Suez Canal and resultant supply disruptions could keep inflation elevated, delaying the easing of monetary conditions. Furthermore, if the last mile of disinflation turns out to be protracted, it may require interest rates to remain higher for longer thereby posing considerable downside risks to growth. At high risk are less developed economies with relatively elevated debt-to- GDP ratio. Rising trade distortions and geoeconomic fragmentation could also weigh on global trade and growth. All these factors can pull down global growth well below the baseline. In such a scenario, if global growth is 100 bps lower than the baseline, domestic growth and inflation could be around 30 bps and 15 bps, respectively, below their baseline trajectories. Conversely, on the upside, a faster disinflation could allow monetary authorities to reduce policy rates earlier than anticipated, easing financial conditions further, improving sentiments and providing a fillip to global growth. Further, a greater push for supply- side reforms and harnessing of new technologies such as artificial intelligence could provide a boost to productivity, global growth and demand. In this scenario, if global growth is higher by 50 bps, domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by around 15 bps and 7 bps, respectively (Charts I.11a and I.12a). The projections of growth and inflation presented in this chapter are, inter alia, conditioned on the assumptions set out in Table 1.2. These are subject to uncertainties on the global growth outlook, crude oil prices, exchange rate and food prices. Against this backdrop, this section explores the alternative scenarios to assess the balance of risks to the baseline projections. Global economic activity moderated in H2:2023 but remained more robust than anticipated earlier. With inflation declining and growth holding firm, the likelihood of a soft landing has increased for the global economy. There are, however, downside risks, going Global crude oil prices have remained highly volatile, with Brent crude falling from a high of US$ 95 in early October 2023 to below US$ 75 by mid-December, before rebounding and settling above US$ 80 in the first quarter of 2024. An escalation in the conflict in West Asia and logistical impediments in key trade routes may cause serious disruptions in the oil market. Assuming crude oil price to be 10 per cent above the baseline, domestic inflation could be higher by 30 bps and growth weaker by around 15 bps, respectively. Conversely, de-escalation of geopolitical tensions along with a further weakening of global demand may pull down crude oil prices. If crude oil prices fall by 10 per cent relative to the baseline and assuming their full pass-through to the domestic product prices, inflation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 15 bps to India\u2019s real GDP growth (Charts I.11a and I.12a). In H2, the Indian Rupee (INR) moved bi-directionally against the US dollar. Looking ahead, a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 interest rate scenario could keep risk aversion towards EME assets elevated, impinging upon capital flows. Concerns around public debt in EMEs, particularly in those with large foreign currency debt, could induce flight to safety and a broad-based depreciation of EME currencies. Crude oil and other commodity prices could harden over the baseline. Should the INR depreciate by 5 per cent from the baseline assumption, inflation could edge up by i her crude pri l bal grow er crude pri oba growth slow Exchange L wer food i around 35 bps while GDP growth could be higher by around 25 bps through stimulating exports. On the other hand, the Indian economy remains the fastest growing large economy in the world and is pivotal to the global outlook. Sustained global disinflation and the accompanying scenario of monetary easing in AEs along with the strengthening of domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and the inclusion of government bonds in global indices could enhance India\u2019s attractiveness as a destination for foreign investors. In this scenario, if the INR appreciates by 5 per cent relative to the baseline, inflation and GDP growth could moderate by around 35 bps and 25 bps, respectively (Chart I.11b and I.12b). Food inflation exhibited sizeable volatility in H2:2023- 24, driven by large shocks to vegetable prices. Erratic rainfall and deficient soil moisture hindered rabi sowing, although the effect was uneven across crops and regions. While crops such as wheat, oilseeds and coarse cereals witnessed an increase in acreage, area sown under pulses declined by over 6 lakh hectares year-on-year. Water reservoir levels have dipped below the decadal average. According to the SAE, production of cereals, pulses and oilseeds in 2023-24 was lower than a year ago. These developments impart uncertainty to the outlook on food prices. The global food price outlook is also subject to significant upside risks from the historically unprecedented heat wave sweeping across the globe. The India Meteorological forecast above-normal Department temperatures and heatwave days during the summer season. Climate change has increased the frequency and ferocity of weather shocks, posing challenges for monetary policy (Box I.2). All these developments could impart upside risk to the domestic food inflation trajectory and could raise headline inflation by around 100 bps over the baseline. On the other hand, ample foodgrains buffer stocks and effective supply management could help ease food inflationary (IMD) has Global average temperatures are on a rise, with accompanying increase in extreme weather events (EWE), and the economic and social impact of global warming is becoming increasingly evident. There are different channels through which climate change can affect monetary policy. First, climate change directly impacts inflation through adverse weather events affecting agricultural production and global supply chains. Second, climate change could impact the natural rate of interest due to increasing temperatures and occurrence of EWE undermining productivity and lowering potential output. Thirdly, the after-effects of climate change might weaken the transmission of monetary policy actions to financing conditions faced by households and firms (Schnabel, 2021). For these reasons, central banks are increasingly incorporating climate risks explicitly into their modelling frameworks. the National institute Global Econometric Model (NiGEM) is used to estimate the counterfactual macroeconomic impact of climate change (Scenario 1) vis-\u00e0-vis a no climate change scenario (Baseline) (RBI, 2023; Dafermos, 2022). In the absence of any climate mitigation policies, the long- term output will be lower by around 9 per cent by 2050 vis- \u00e0-vis a no climate change scenario with full pass-through of the physical risks of climate change to the economy. Both inflation and its volatility may increase over time (RBI, 2023). Lower productivity may lead to a fall in the natural rate of interest. Frequent shocks to inflation will, if inflation hysteresis gets entrenched, it may lead to de- anchoring of inflation expectations. The undermining of the central bank\u2019s credibility would warrant even higher A New-Keynesian model that incorporates a physical climate risk damage function calibrated with aspects of interest rates to rein in inflation, entailing greater loss of s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P References: Dafermos, Y (2022), Monetary policy and the macroeconomic modelling of climate change, ASEAN Core Curriculum on Climate Risk Resilience/Sustainable Finance.

Buoyed by strong domestic demand and backed by robust macroeconomic fundamentals, India has emerged as the fastest growing major economy of the world in 2023-24. The upturn in the investment cycle, broad-based revival in manufacturing and services sectors, government\u2019s capex push, upbeat business and consumer sentiments and strong corporate and bank balance sheets provide impetus to the growth momentum going forward. Volatile food prices, however, interrupt the path of disinflation and cloud the inflation outlook. The continuing effect of monetary policy action and stance is keeping core inflation muted. Spillovers from geopolitical hostilities, volatile global financial markets and climate shocks are the key risks to the growth and inflation outlook. Headline inflation has been on a moderating path during H2:2023-24 with resurgences in food price pressures interrupting the descent, even as core inflation softened across its goods and services components. Industrial and farm input price pressures remain muted, and nominal rural and organised sector wage growth stays steady. Going forward, the risks to the 'last mile' of disinflation process may emanate from incidence of unpredictable supply side shocks. Since August 2023, headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation1 has been on a moderating trajectory, troughing at 4.9 per cent in October 2023. A resurgence of food price pressures pushed it up to 5.7 per cent in December, despite steady core (CPI excluding food and fuel)2 disinflation and a deepening fuel price deflation. In January-February 2024, headline inflation eased to 5.1 per cent, with both food and core inflation easing and fuel prices remaining in deflation (Chart II.1). Notwithstanding the moderation, food inflation remained elevated. The softening of core inflation to 3.4 per cent in February, among the lowest prints in the current CPI series (2012=100), was broad based across its goods and services components. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections, if any, and explain the underlying reasons thereof. The October 2023 MPR had projected inflation to edge down to 5.6 per cent in Q3:2023- 24 and further to 5.2 per cent in Q4 (Chart II.2). Actual inflation at 5.4 per cent in Q3 and at 5.1 per cent in Q4 (January-February 2024) was lower than the projections by 20 basis points (bps) and 10 bps, respectively. The undershooting of inflation came about from food as well as core components. Proactive supply side interventions helped to contain the build-up of price pressures, especially in respect of onions, cereals and pulses. In the core component, 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A Food and beverages CPI excluding food and fuel Tolerance band 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in the all-India consumer price index (CPI) produced by the National Statistical Office (NSO). 2 Core CPI, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups \u2018food and beverages\u2019 and \u2018fuel and light\u2019 from the headline CPI. the softening of services inflation, particularly under housing, turned out to be sharper than anticipated. Headline inflation dynamics in H2:2023-24 were broadly shaped by the interplay between volatile food price momentum and base effects3. Favourable base effects and sharp negative price momentum \u2013 from a part reversal of the spike in vegetable prices in July, sharp decline in LPG prices and muted rise in core CPI prices \u2013 pulled down headline inflation from 6.8 per cent in August to 5.0 per cent in September. Thereafter, by November, headline inflation edged up on a significant pick-up in food price momentum and unfavourable base effects. Although the momentum turned negative in December, a strong unfavourable base effect, primarily from the food group, pushed up headline inflation further to 5.7 per cent. In January 2024, the decline in momentum, driven by correction in food prices along with favourable base effects, led to a softening of headline inflation to 5.1 per cent. It remained steady in February as a positive price momentum in food and core was evened out by favourable base effects from fuel and core groups (Chart II.3). A comparison of the distribution of CPI inflation in 2023-24 vis-\u00e0-vis 2022-23 indicates that a fall in the mean of the distribution to 5.4 per cent in 2023-24 (April-February) from 6.8 per cent in the corresponding period of 2022-23 coexisted with a marked increase in its standard deviation (Chart II.4). Furthermore, inflation variability across CPI remained high in H2 of 2023-24 (Chart II.5), attesting to the lingering impact of overlapping supply side shocks on the inflation s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A d: CPI excluding Food and Fuel s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A 3 A change in CPI year-on-year (y-o-y) inflation between any two months is the difference between the current month-on-month (m-o-m) change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details, see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. y t i s n e D Headline CPI diffusion indices (DIs)4 remained elevated since August 2023, driven largely by CPI goods, with some moderation observed in February 2024. DI for CPI services corrected during November-December, but it registered a pick-up in January-February (Chart II.6a). Even as CPI DIs remained in the expansionary zone, threshold DI5 \u2013 for price increases in excess of 4 per cent as well as 6 per cent on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (saar) basis \u2013 slipped further into the contractionary zone in H2:2023-24, indicating that a 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A 4 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. The higher the reading above 50, the broader is the expansion or generalisation of price increases; the further is the reading below 50, the broader is the price decline across items. 5 Threshold diffusion indices capture the dispersion of price increases in CPI basket beyond the specified saar thresholds of 4 per cent and 6 per cent. generalised and durable disinflation is underway in A historical decomposition of inflation using a vector autoregression (VAR)6 model indicates that the moderation in inflation in Q3:2023-24 and in overall CPI) contributed to around 80 per cent of services (with a weight of 23.4 per cent) contributed Q4 came from weakening of supply side shocks, the remaining 20 per cent.

All variables other than policy repo rate are y-o-y growth rates. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et; where et represents a vector of shocks. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. around 86 per cent (Chart II.7b). Perishable items (non-durable with a 7-day recall7), which include vegetables, spices, fruits and other food items such as milk, meat and fish and prepared meals, contributed most to goods inflation variability. Among semi -perishables (non-durable goods with a 30-day recall), cereals, pulses, electricity, personal care items (like toiletries) and medicines were the main drivers of inflation. Broadly, the contribution of durables (goods with a 365-day recall) like clothing and footwear items, and electronic items) to overall inflation came down of price setting behaviour suggests that after adjusting wide price shocks tend to lead to more frequent change in food prices. Core prices tend to be stickier The extent of price stickiness or the degree of responsiveness of retail prices to changing market conditions has a considerable bearing on persistence observed in the inflation process and the impact of monetary policy actions on macroeconomic variables. Price stickiness in CPI item level data for the period Jan-2014 to Jan-2024 is analysed based on the indirect frequency approach (Banerjee and Bhattacharya, 2017)8. price changes being higher in case of food. A statistically significant positive correlation between frequency and size of price change (0.46) indicates that exogenous price shocks often trigger corresponding price adjustments. After controlling for idiosyncratic price shocks9 that is specific to each item in CPI basket, the results indicate (CPI excluding food and fuel) in a month from economy- wide aggregate shocks is 24 per cent and 20 per cent, wide shocks could translate to price changes, on an #: Controlling for idiosyncratic price shocks Source: RBI staff estimates. 7 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Under MMRP, data are collected on expenditures incurred for frequently purchased items \u2013 edible oil, eggs, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, spices, beverages, processed foods, pan, tobacco and intoxicants \u2013 during the last seven days; for clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods, during the last 365 days; and for all other food, fuel and light, miscellaneous goods and services including non-institutional medical services, rents and taxes, data relate to the last 30 days. 8 The indirect frequency approach relies on the following indicator function: = 0 if pit = pit-1; Iit = 1 if pit \u2260 pit -1; where, i = 1, 2, \u2026, k (where k is the number of items in CPI), t = 1, 2, \u2026, n (where n is the number of periods), and time t. The average frequency of price change (Ii) and implied duration of price spell (Di) is calculated for each item in CPI basket as follows: is the CPI index for item i in The Ii and Di for various CPI sub-groups/groups are obtained as a weighted average of CPI items. 9 Item specific price shocks greater than one standard deviation were considered for computing frequency and duration as price changes less than one standard deviation could largely reflect idiosyncratic factors specific to individual items. # After controlling for idiosyncratic price shocks * Includes milk, egg, meat and fish sub-groups. ** Other food includes non-alcoholic beverages and prepared meals. Note: Figures in parenthesis indicate weights in CPI. Source: RBI staff estimates. In terms of sub-groups, the duration of price stickiness within food group is lower for perishable items like vegetables and fruits, signifying more frequent incidence of price changes due to shocks. Within the non-food sub- groups/groups, higher duration of price spells were seen in sub-groups of health, transport and communication, and household goods and services, implying higher price stickiness10 (Chart II.1.1). Vegetables, with an average month-on-month price increase of 1.25 per cent, is an outlier when compared to other sub-groups. Excluding vegetables, the size of monthly price changes, on an average, has been in the range of 0.24 per cent to 0.62 per cent (Chart II.1.2). The analysis shows that core prices tend to be stickier while food prices are vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Given the overlapping nature of shocks to food sector in recent times (Patra et al. 2024), the evolving food price trajectory also needs to be carefully monitored for its implications on headline inflation persistence and anchoring of inflation expectations.

Food and beverages (weight of 45.9 per cent in the CPI basket) inflation, which increased sharply in July-August 2023 due to a spike in vegetables prices caused by excess rainfall/floods and supply disruptions, moderated in September-October with the normalisation of supply chains and fresh crop arrivals. The softening was short-lived, however, and food inflation picked up again in November-December and remained elevated at 7.8 per cent in February 2024, primarily driven by increase in inflation of vegetables, pulses, as well as from an uptick in egg, meat and fish inflation in February. Food inflation excluding vegetables, however, moderated from 6.8 per cent in September 2023 to 4.9 per cent in February 2024, on the back of easing of inflation in cereals, milk, spices and prepared meals. Oils and fats sub-group has been in deflation since February 2023 (Chart II.8). Though vegetable prices dominated the overall food price build-up during 2023-24 so far, pulses, eggs, spices, cereals and sugar also registered substantial price increases, much higher than historical patterns. s e l b a t e g e V s t c u d o r p d n a s e c i p S s l a e r e C d n a r a g u S y r a n o i t c e f n o c ) 9 . 7 ( h s i f d n a t a e M , s l a e m d e r a p e r P s k c a n s c i l o h o c l a - n o N s e g a r e v e b s t i u r F s t a f d n a s e g a r e v e b d n a d o o F Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI - food and beverages.

Moreover, oils and fats registered significant price decline. As a result, price build-up in food excluding vegetables was lower than that in the pre-COVID period (Chart II.9). s e g a r e v e b d n a d o o F s e l b a t e g e v g n i d u l c x e The relatively shallower winter easing in vegetables prices during November 2023-February 2024 was primarily driven by lower market arrivals due to unseasonal rainfall in some parts of the country; above-normal temperatures owing to prevailing El- Ni\u00f1o conditions turning unfavourable for winter crop yields; lower production of some vegetables like garlic; and higher demand during the festival season. Moreover, deficient production in kharif pulses [(-) 6.6 per cent as per the second advance estimates (SAE) of 2023-24 over final estimates (FE) of 2022-23] on top of a decline in year-on-year (y-o-y) production in 2022-23 contributed to the hardening of inflation in pulses. The observed price pressures in the food and beverages group, however, was not broad-based as inflation remained below 4 per cent for items weighing almost 50 per cent in the food basket in February 2024. Inflation in cereals (weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group) moderated from 10.9 per cent in September 2023 to 7.6 per cent in February 2024 (Chart II.10). While rice prices, on a y-o-y basis, remained in double digits, prices of wheat (y-o-y) witnessed a sustained moderation since March 2023. Rice prices (y-o-y) were elevated as supply conditions remained tight despite restrictions on rice exports due to lower production [(-) 1.4 per cent based on the SAE of 2023-24 over FE of 2022-23]. Comfortable buffer stocks of rice (7.6 times the norm as of March 16, 2024) along with price stabilisation measures, including extension of 20 per cent duty on exports of parboiled rice; fixing the minimum export prices (MEP) of basmati rice at US$ 950 per tonne; increased offloading under the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS); and a targeted sale of newly launched \u2018Bharat Rice\u2019 at a fixed price (`29 per kg) are likely to improve domestic availability and enable ebbing of price pressures in the medium term. In the case of wheat, price stabilisation measures including tightening of stock limits with respect to traders/wholesalers and retailers; the increased offloading of stocks under the OMSS; the sale of newly launched \u2018Bharat Atta\u2019 at a fixed retail price (`27.5 per kg); and the ban/restriction on wheat exports since May 2022 helped contain inflation. The hike in the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat by 7.1 per cent in the rabi marketing season (RMS) of 2024-25 and an improved acreage by 1.2 per cent in the 2023-24 rabi season augurs well for higher wheat production and domestic supply. The SAE of 2023-24 indicates an increase in production of wheat by 1.3 per cent over the FE of 2022-23. Vegetables (weight of 6.0 per cent in the CPI and 13.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) price inflation moderated in September-October 2023 but increased in November 2023-February 2024 due to less than usual winter easing in prices, above-normal temperatures, and cold waves in some parts of northern India (Chart II.11). 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - g u A 9 1 - g u A 0 2 - g u A 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - g u A increased Among key vegetables, onion prices sharply in November 2023 with a y-o-y inflation of 86.3 per cent driven by lower kharif acreage and fall in production [(-)15.7 per cent in 2023-24 as per the first advance estimates (FAE) over FE of 2022-23] due to erratic rainfall, on top of a production shortfall s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e p n n o i t u b i r r t n o C 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A Note: Figures in parentheses indicate items' weights in CPI-vegetables.

Onion prices fell in December such as imposition of 40 per cent export duty, followed by prohibition of exports, increased procurement, per kg) from select outlets helped improve domestic after the surge in July-August due to floods and supply bottlenecks in some parts of the country. Inflationary pressures, however, recurred in November due to unseasonal rainfall which damaged crops. Potato prices, however, remained in deflation since February 2023 till January 2024 on account of higher production last year (an increase of 7.1 per cent in 2022-23 over FE of 2021-22). Production in 2023-24 experienced some shortfall [(-)1.9 per cent in 2023-24 as per the FAE over FE of 2022-23]. Potato prices increased in February, on a y-o-y basis, primarily due to an adverse base effect. Vegetables excluding TOP (tomato; onion; and potato) category like garlic, cauliflower and cabbage also witnessed lower than usual price correction during November 2023-February 2024, thereby emerging as major drivers of vegetables inflation (Chart II.11). More specifically, the lower production of garlic [(-) 0.8 per cent in 2023-24 as per the FAE over 2022-23 on top of (-) 8.1 per cent in 2022-23 over 2021-22] resulted in sustained price pressures leading to triple digit inflation since September 2023 \u2013 reaching 264.3 per cent in February 2024. As a result, vegetable price build-ups across TOP and non-TOP categories turned out to be much larger than usual in the financial year so far (Chart II.12). availability and contain price pressures. Tomato prices recorded y-o-y deflation in September-October 2023 r p A y a M g u A c e D r a M r p A y a M g u A c e D r a M Inflation in fruits (weight of 2.9 per cent in the CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages group), recorded a sustained increase since June 2023, peaking at 11.1 per cent in December 2023 before moderating to 4.8 per cent in February 2024. Elevated inflation in fruits, despite higher production (1.7 per cent in 2023-24 as per the FAE over FE of 2022-23), was driven primarily by apple due to lower than usual correction in its prices in November 2023-February 2024. Inflation in groundnut prices also remained in double digits during July-December 2023 on account of lower production. s e n n o t h k a L The primary source of plant-based protein i.e., pulses (weight of 2.4 per cent in the CPI and 5.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) recorded a sharp increase in prices. Double digit inflation since June 2023 was primarily driven by lower production of tur [(-) 21.5 per cent in 2022-23 over 2021-22 and an increase of only 0.8 per cent in 2023-24 as per the SAE over 2022-23], urad [(-) 5.2 per cent in 2022-23 over 2021-22 and (-) 14.4 per cent in 2023-24 as per the SAE of 2023-24 over 2022-23] and moong [(-) 17.6 per cent in 2023-24 as per the SAE of 2023-24 over 2022-23] CPI pulses inflation (per cent, y-o-y) is also reflected in lower stock-to-use ratio (Chart II.14). Price pressures in pulses eased marginally and inflation moderated to 18.9 per cent in February 2024 following supply-side measures including extension of \u2018free\u2019 import policy for urad and tur till March 31, increased within the group) were partially offset by moderation has consistently moderated since its 9-year peak of r p A y a M g u A c e D r a M milk production as well as easing feed and fodder costs.

While core goods inflation moderated by around 190 bps from 5.4 per s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 4.2 per cent to 3.2 per cent during the same period. The key drivers of the softening in goods inflation were clothing and footwear, household goods, health and personal care and effects (excluding gold and silver) (Chart II.24a). In the case of services, housing (primarily house rent), transportation fares (bus/tram/ taxi fare, air fare) and communication services drove the moderation in inflation (Chart II.24b). g n i d u l c x e r a e w t o o f d n a d n a n o i t a c i n u m m o c g n i s u o H d n a s e c i v r e s s t c e f f e d n a e r a c h t l a e H n o i t a c u d E t n e m e s u m a d n a n o i t a e r c e R g n i d u l c x e Trimmed mean measures16 also indicated an easing of underlying inflation pressures, with weighted median inflation registering a decline of around 160 bps from 5.2 per cent in August 2023 to 3.6 per cent in February 2024 (Table II.3). cent in August 2023 to 3.5 per cent in February 2024, core services inflation fell by around 105 bps from labourers (CPI-AL) CPI and rural labourers (CPI-RL) exceeded CPI headline inflation during September 2023-February 2024 due to higher food and fuel inflation.

For services sector, the pace of increase in input prices remained volatile with a sharp pick-up in March 2024 due to food, labour costs, cosmetics and medical equipment. The prices charged by service firms rose more than input prices in March based across goods and services, risks to the 'last mile' of disinflation process may emanate from its spillovers to trade and commodity markets. The and proactive supply side measures have helped steer uncertainties. This approach would need to be sustained to ensure a durable return of inflation to 2024 which led to a further narrowing of the input- the target, thereby setting strong foundations for the high growth trajectory that is underway. 18 Based on the monthly Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. The survey polls a panel of business leaders primarily from the manufacturing sector about their inflation expectations in the short and medium term. Domestic economic activity remained resilient in H2:2023-24 with investment demand firming up at a robust pace. Manufacturing activity strengthened further, and construction activity stayed firm. Consumer and business optimism remains buoyant. Headwinds from geopolitical tensions, rising geoeconomic fragmentation, volatility in global commodity prices, and escalation of Red Sea disruptions, however, pose risks to the outlook. After a strong performance in H1:2023-24, the momentum of domestic economic activity remained resilient in H2, driven by strong aggregate demand. Fixed investment firmed up at a robust pace with the government\u2019s continued thrust on infrastructure building. Private corporate investment is gaining vitality. Private consumption held up well in urban areas, although its overall growth moderated. India\u2019s exports recouped some ground which, in conjunction with deceleration in imports growth, led to a lower drag from net external demand on aggregate demand in H2. Overall, real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded strongly by 7.6 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2023-24, with 8.4 per cent growth in Q3 \u2013 the third successive quarter of over eight per cent growth. On the supply side, manufacturing activity continued to gain traction in H2, supported by lower commodity prices, diversifying global supply chains and easing logistic costs due to improving infrastructure.

The latest quarterly PLFS indicate that LFPR for person aged 15 years and above (current weekly status) increased to 49.9 per the survey\u2019s inception. The unemployment rate in urban areas during Q3 dropped to 6.5 per cent, the The labour force participation rate (LFPR) and employment rate (ER) reflect improvement in labour market conditions. As per the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), LFPR at all India level for persons aged 15 years and above (usual status) improved to 59.8 per cent (56.1 per cent last year) and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.1 per cent (3.6 per cent last year) as net payroll additions rose by 12.5 per cent y-o-y Analysing the impact of policy rate changes on aggregate demand (consumption and investment) is important for monetary policy transmission (Mallick and Agarwal, 2007; Pattanaik et al., 2014). This involves isolating changes in the policy rate due to monetary policy surprises or shocks. Policy rate shocks are derived as residuals in a regression of actual policy rate on actual and expected1 inflation and GDP growth2 (Holm et al., 2021). Subsequently, the impact of policy rate shocks3 on private consumption and fixed investment is examined, by including potential asymmetric effects4 in a Vector Auto Regression (VAR) model for Q4:2007-08 to Q2:2023-24. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is used as a control variable for domestic demand shocks. The impulse response of private consumption and fixed investment to a one standard deviation change in policy rate shocks5 suggests that private consumption exhibits a swift adverse response, reaching its peak approximately after two quarters following a policy rate shock, while the maximum response of fixed investment is seen around the fifth quarter (Chart III.1.1). The full impact of policy rate shocks on fixed investment takes relatively more time to materialise compared to private consumption. Furthermore, the asymmetric impact suggests a stronger and statistically significant impact on both private consumption and fixed investment during tightening cycles, whereas the impact on both appears insignificant during easing cycles. 1 Expected inflation and GDP growth are taken from survey of Professional Forecasters, RBI. 2 , represent inflation and GDP growth, respectively. The k subscripts refer to the horizon of the forecast: 0 is the current quarter; 1, 2 and Where 3 are one, two and three quarters ahead, respectively. The horizons are relative to the date of the forecast corresponding to meeting m. 3 Since policy shocks do not have a contemporaneous impact on consumption and investment, they are therefore considered with one period lag. 4 can be defined as: 5 Private consumption and fixed investment are converted into first difference of logarithmic form and multiplied by 100. s t n i o P e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o P e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o P e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o P e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o P e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o P e g a t n e c r e P Note: Impulse Responses reflect responses to one standard deviation Cholesky Innovations.

Under this scheme, `95,225.77 crore has already been disbursed to the states by February 2024. This scheme has been extended for 2024-25 in the interim union budget, with 23.2 per cent higher allocations over 2023-24 (RE). The quality of states expenditure continued to improve, owing to sustained growth-inducing capex (Chart III. 13a and 13b). During 2023-24 (April-January), states\u2019 GFD reached 67.5 per cent of their budget estimates, higher than a year ago, as growth in revenue receipts slowed down to 7.4 per cent y-o-y (18.4 per cent last year). States\u2019 own tax revenues increased at a moderate pace during April-January 2023-24, partly due to contraction in revenues from sales tax/ value-added tax (VAT). On the expenditure front, revenue expenditure increased at a decelerated pace during April-January 2023-24, while capital spending rose by 31.2 per cent y-o-y during this period (Chart III.12a and b).

The Reserve Bank conducted market operations to ensure adequate liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy. During H2:2023-24, global financial markets remained volatile in anticipating the course of monetary policy. While sovereign bond yields moderated from October 2023, they have hardened since January 2024. Global equity markets remained buoyant in several advanced and emerging market economies. In the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened in Q3:2023-24 in the wake of tight labour market conditions, easing inflation, resilient economic growth and hawkish Fed policy commentary. Consequently, emerging market currencies turned volatile amidst large fluctuations in capital flows. In contrast to global movements, domestic financial markets remained relatively stable. Money market rates evolved in tune with liquidity shifts; in contrast, long-term government bond yields eased in response to domestic developments. Equity markets remained buoyant with intermittent corrections. The INR was the least volatile among major EM currencies.

The weighted average yield (WAY) on traded maturities for G-secs declined by 11 bps while that on T-bills increased by 31 bps in H2 from their levels in H2:2022- 23, reflecting liquidity tightness at the shorter end. Yields softened across the term structure as reflected The moderation continued in January 2024 due to lower-than-expected supply of state government securities. Domestic yields eased further in February 2024 following the announcement of lower gross market borrowings in the Interim Budget 2024-25.

Public sector banks (including regional rural banks) Private banks (including small finance banks) From a sectoral perspective, credit growth was driven by services and retail sectors. Credit growth to agriculture sector peaked in January 2024 and outpaced that to the retail sector. Industrial credit growth, which was tepid during the first half of 2023- 24, improved in the third quarter. Credit growth to the services sector remained resilient during 2023-24, while personal loans growth moderated, especially after the regulatory measures taken by the Reserve Bank on November 16, 2023 5. SCBs\u2019 incremental credit offtake in agriculture and services sectors rose to 15.9 per cent and 35.9 per cent in February 2024 from 12.6 per cent and 35.1 per cent, respectively, in the previous year. On the contrary, the incremental share of personal loans declined over the same period (Chart IV.19). Credit to agriculture and allied activities registered double digit growth, improving to 20.1 per cent (y-o-y) in February 2024 from 15.0 per cent a year ago. The enhanced agriculture credit target and the interest subvention scheme provided by the government kept agriculture credit growth robust6. Industrial credit growth rose to 8.6 per cent in February 2024 from 6.8 per cent in the previous year due to improved credit offtake by large as well as micro and small industries. Among major industries, industries exhibited robust textiles and metals bank credit demand during the year, while credit to infrastructure and chemical industries picked up pace during H2:2023-24 (Chart IV.20). Services sector credit witnessed a healthy growth of 21.2 per cent (y-o-y) in February 2024 as compared with 20.5 per cent a year ago. Credit to NBFCs continued to be the largest contributor to this growth, though the pace moderated during the year.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934 requires the RBI to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time, if any, in the public domain Among the autonomous factors, currency in circulation (CiC) drained liquidity from the banking system in H2 as it expanded by `2.26 lakh crore due to festival demand and state elections. This was more than offset by the drawdown of government cash balances (`1.43 lakh crore) and net forex purchases10 by the Reserve Bank (`1.95 lakh crore). OMO sales through the NDS- OM11 withdrew liquidity from the banking system while the phased unwinding of the incremental cash reserve ratio (I-CRR)12 augmented liquidity.

The I-CRR was reviewed on September 8, 2023, and was discontinued in a phased manner, ending October 7, 2023. Liquidity management implementation of is monetary policy decisions on a day-to-day basis through market operations. The liquidity management framework of the Reserve Bank is continuously reviewed and, as and when deemed appropriate, suitably modified to ensure efficient transmission of monetary policy signals (RBI, 2021). Changes in the framework are complemented with operational modifications to provide flexibility to banks in their own liquidity management. The revised liquidity management framework was announced on February 6 (RBI, 2020a) and operationalised on February 14, 2020. The salient features of the framework are given below: The weighted average call rate (WACR) remains the operating target of monetary policy. The objective of liquidity management operations is to keep the WACR around the policy repo rate, which is the single policy rate under the LAF and is decided by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank. Under the LAF, the standing facilities are (i) the marginal standing facility (MSF) through which the Reserve Bank provides liquidity to banks against collateral; and (ii) the standing deposit facility (SDF) wherein banks park surplus funds with the Reserve Bank at the end of the day without collateral backing.13 Both the standing facilities are available on all days of the week throughout the year. Thus, the liquidity management corridor is characterised by the rates on the standing facilities \u2013 the MSF rate as its upper bound (ceiling) and the SDF rate as the lower bound (floor) \u2013 with the policy repo rate within and ordinarily in the middle of the corridor.14 At present, the MSF and SDF rates are equidistant from the policy repo rate \u2013 25 bps above and below, respectively \u2013 thus rendering the liquidity management corridor symmetric with a width of 50 bps. While the facilities under the LAF are accessible to banks, standalone primary dealers (SPDs) are allowed to participate directly in all overnight liquidity management operations, including the SDF. SPDs are, however, not allowed access to the MSF. As per the extant framework, instruments of liquidity management include variable rate repo/reverse repo (VRR/ VRRR) auctions of various maturities (1-14 days), outright open market operations (OMOs), buy/sell forex swaps and other instruments as may be deployed from time to time. In order to facilitate the development of a term money market and with a view to nudge banks towards taking a view on interest rates beyond the overnight rate, a 14-day term VRR/VRRR operation at a variable rate and conducted to coincide with the cash reserve ratio (CRR) maintenance cycle15 is the main liquidity management tool.16 The main liquidity operation is supported by fine- tuning operations, overnight and/or of longer tenor, to tide over any unanticipated frictional liquidity changes during the reserve maintenance period. In addition, the RBI may conduct, if required, longer-term variable rate repo/reverse repo operations of more than 14 days. To provide eligible LAF/MSF participants greater flexibility in managing their end of the day CRR balances, the Reserve Bank has introduced an optional automated sweep-in and sweep-out (ASISO) facility in its e-Kuber system effective August 6, 2020 (RBI, 2020b). Under the facility, banks can set the amount (specific or range) that they wish to keep as balances in their current accounts with the Reserve Bank at the end of each day. Depending upon this pre-set amount, access to the MSF and the SDF, as the case may be, are generated automatically without any manual intervention at the end of the day. This facility is optional and is in addition to the existing mechanism of placing manual bids in the SDF and MSF windows through the e-Kuber portal. 13 The margin requirements under the LAF (haircut on eligible collateral) are reviewed on a periodic basis; the margin requirement for reverse repo transactions with the Reserve Bank continue to be \u2018Nil\u2019. 14 Prior to April 8, 2022, the fixed rate reverse repo (FRRR) acted as the floor of the LAF corridor. Since then, the FRRR \u2013 retained at 3.35 per cent \u2013 continues to remain as part of the Reserve Bank\u2019s toolkit to be used at its discretion for purposes specified from time to time (RBI, 2022). 15 Currently, banks are required to maintain a minimum of 90 per cent of the prescribed CRR on a daily basis. 16 The daily fixed rate repo was withdrawn with effect from February 14, 2020. Taking cognisance of banks\u2019 higher recourse to the MSF while simultaneously parking large surplus funds under the SDF, reversal of liquidity facilities under both the SDF and the MSF was allowed even during weekends and holidays, effective December 30, 2023.17 This facility provides banks greater flexibility in their operations, alleviates tightness liquidity conditions during weekends and imparts greater efficiency to liquidity management. daily flow as well as stock of liquidity operations; and (ii) the Reserve Bank started publishing a quantitative assessment of durable liquidity conditions in the banking system on a fortnightly basis with a lag of one fortnight. In addition, periodic consultations are conducted with market participants and other stakeholders. In order to improve communication on the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity management framework and procedures, the (i) daily press release detailing Money Market Operations (MMO) was modified suitably to show the impact of both net injection under the LAF narrowed to `0.53 lakh four and a half years and the deficit persisted in the H2.18 The Reserve Bank injected liquidity through twenty-nine variable rate repo (VRR) operations \u2013 six System liquidity turned into deficit mode for the first main and twenty-three fine tuning auctions \u2013 to ease (iii) GoI Cash Balances [build-up (-) / drawdown (+)] (iii) Excess Reserves [build-up (-) / drawdown (+)] (ii) Required Reserves [including both change in NDTL and CRR] CiC: Currency in Circulation.

Additionally, banks took recourse to the MSF and borrowed funds \u2013 `0.72 lakh crore in H2 \u2013 higher than `0.29 lakh crore in H1. Daily MSF borrowings scaled an all-time high of `2.34 lakh crore on November 22, 2023. Of the average total absorption under the LAF at `0.76 lakh crore during H2, average placement under the SDF constituted about 88.2 per cent (`0.67 lakh crore), while the remaining was absorbed through VRRR auctions. During H2, six fine tuning VRRR auctions were conducted between February 2-7, 2024, to absorb surplus liquidity engendered by the pick-up in government spending, followed by eight more in the remaining part of February and March. In view of banks\u2019 likely preference for holding liquidity in the wake of deficit conditions, eleven of these operations were of overnight maturity. On a net basis, average daily injection amounted to `1.06 lakh crore in H2 as against net absorption of `1.07 lakh crore in H1. Adjusted for government cash balances, however, average potential liquidity in the banking system remained in surplus (`2.34 lakh crore) during H2. Reserve money (RM) expanded by 6.7 per cent (y-o-y) (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the CRR) as against 7.4 per cent a year ago. The growth in currency in circulation (CiC) decelerated to 4.1 per cent from 7.8 per cent a year ago, reflecting the withdrawal of `2000 banknotes. Money supply (M3) increased by 11.2 per cent (y-o-y) as at end-March 2024 from 9.0 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year, led by double digit growth in aggregate deposits (Table IV.9).

Based on an assessment of the liquidity conditions and its impact on PDs, the Reserve Bank of India made available an aggregate amount of `5,000 crore, over and above the existing limit of `5,000 crore, to Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) under the Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF) at the prevailing repo rate effective January 31, 2024. Moreover, as a special case, SPDs were also allowed to participate in the 6-day VRR auction of `75,000 crore conducted on March 27, 2024. Domestic financial market conditions evolved in an orderly manner in H2:2023-24, notwithstanding volatility in global market conditions. Money market rates moved in consonance with the monetary policy stance. While short-term rates fluctuated in reflection of liquidity developments, long-term rates remained largely stable, reflecting better anchoring of inflation expectations. Equity market scaled new highs, supported by inflows from domestic investors. The INR exhibited lower volatility than its emerging market peers. Monetary transmission continued amidst robust credit growth outpacing deposit expansion. The evolution of liquidity conditions was in alignment with the monetary policy stance. Going forward, the Reserve Bank will remain agile and nimble in conducting market operations to ensure financial stability while providing liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy. The global economy remained resilient. Inflation eased, although it still rules above targets in several economies prompting central banks to maintain monetary policy restraint as they tread the 'last mile' of disinflation. Geopolitical tensions, elevated public debt amidst tight financial conditions, weak recovery in China, geoeconomic fragmentation and extreme weather events pose downside risks to the outlook. Since the October 2023 MPR, the global economy has exhibited resilience amidst several headwinds. Global growth is projected to remain steady in 2024 but with divergent trajectories across countries. Both headline and core inflation (headline excluding food and energy) are easing although headline inflation still rules above targets in several economies. Major central banks have maintained monetary policy restraint as they tread the last mile of disinflation. Global financial markets remain volatile in response to fluctuating perceptions on the monetary policy trajectory. Global equity markets corrected in October 2023 over expectations of \u2018higher for longer\u2019 monetary policy paths but rallied subsequently as prospects of reversal of monetary policy cycles appeared brighter. Bond yields have moderated since October. The US dollar pared gains in Q4:2023 but strengthened in Q1:2024. Emerging market economy (EME) currencies broadly strengthened since the last MPR. Risks to global growth outlook are broadly balanced. manufacturing and business investment amidst elevated borrowing costs. High frequency indicators for Q1:2024 point to rebound in manufacturing and sequential improvement in service sector activity. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) update of January 2024 revised up global growth projection for 2024 by 20 bps to 3.1 per cent and retained the projection for 2025 at 3.2 per cent2. Among major economies, the US economy grew at a resilient pace of 3.4 per cent (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualised rates (q-o-q, saar)) in Q4:2023 (lower than the Q3 outturn of 4.9 per cent) reflecting the support from consumer spending, government spending, exports and non-residential fixed investment (Table V.1). The unemployment rate remained low with a better balance in labour demand and supply than Q3. The US composite S&P global purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI3) edged lower to 52.1 in March from 52.5 in February 2024, its highest since June 2023. In H2:2023, global activity remained resilient but with cross-country divergences. Growth was stronger than anticipated in the United States, and in several major emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs)1. It was subdued in the Euro area and many low-income economies, reflecting weak consumer interest-rate-sensitive sentiment The Euro area stagnated in Q4:2023 following a contraction of 0.2 per cent in Q3 (q-o-q, saar), reflecting monetary tightening and the adverse impact of the war in Ukraine. Industrial production declined on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis for H2:2023 and January 2024 albeit with expansion of production in construction sector. Nonetheless, the labour market remained 1 As per the latest update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the IMF released on January 30, 2024. 2 The OECD in its Economic Outlook Interim Report (February 2024) revised up the global growth forecast by 0.2 percentage points for 2024 to 2.9 per cent from its November 2023 projection; for 2025 the forecast remained unchanged at 3.0 per cent. 3 The references to PMIs are to S&P Global indices, unless specified otherwise. Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted, annualised rate (q-o-q, saar) January-February 2024 was at its highest since June 2023, signalling a robust expansion in business activity in early 2024 before edging down marginally to 52.8 in March. Japan avoided a technical recession as GDP increased by 0.4 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q4:2023 after contracting by 3.2 per cent in Q3, driven by increase in gross fixed capital formation. The unemployment rate remained low at 2.6 per cent in February and nominal wages per employee increased moderately. The composite PMI (au Jibun Bank) remained in expansion since the beginning of 2024, increasing to 51.7 in March from 50.6 in February. Among EMEs, China\u2019s real GDP growth moderated to 4.1 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q4 from 6.1 per cent in Q3 amidst a deepening property crisis, mounting deflationary risks and tepid demand. Nonetheless, for the full year 2023, the economy grew by 5.2 per cent \u2013 propelled higher primarily by base effects \u2013 exceeding the official target of 5.0 per cent. The composite PMI (Caixin) accelerated to 52.7 in March from 52.5 in February, signalling an expansion of the overall Chinese business activity for the fifth straight month. The Chinese economy is projected to grow by 4.6 per cent in 2024, according to the IMF. China has set its real GDP growth target for 2024 at 5 per cent. China undertook monetary easing and provided regulatory relaxation for its real estate sector to stimulate the economy.

The UK economy slipped into technical recession at the end of 2023 as GDP registered a contraction of 0.5 per cent in Q3 and 1.2 per cent in Q4 (q-o-q, saar) due to decline in gross capital formation. The labour market, however, remained relatively tight but with a moderation in Amongst other major EMEs, Brazil\u2019s GDP growth remained relatively steady at 2.1 per cent (y-o-y) in Q4:2023 vis-a-vis 2.0 per cent in Q3, driven by expansion in the industrial sector which was partially offset by a deceleration in its agricultural sector. The labour market, however, remained tight as the unemployment rate declined for nine consecutive months till December 2023 before picking up marginally in January and February 2024. The composite PMI remained unchanged at 55.1 in March 2024 for the second consecutive month its highest joint level since July 2022. The South African economy grew by 1.2 per cent (y-o-y) in Q4:2023 following a contraction of 0.7 per cent in Q3 over expansion in transport, storage and communication industry and robust mining activity. The composite PMI for South Africa declined to 48.4 in March\u2013 down from 50.8 in February \u2013 registering its lowest level since July 2023. The Russian economy grew by 5.5 per cent (y-o-y) in Q3:2023, partly driven by soaring military and defence spending. The composite PMI at 52.7 in March, up from 52.2 in February, signalled a modest expansion in private sector business activity. The south-east Asian economies have shown resilience in the face of large global shocks. To a large extent, this can be attributed to improved monetary and macroeconomic policy frameworks. Growth in the region has remained strong, while inflation has been lower than the OECD average. The ASEAN4 economies recorded resilient growth in Q4, amidst higher output but lower new orders. In Q1:2024, growth improved sequentially with increased output, higher employment and reduction in suppliers\u2019 delivery time. The ASEAN manufacturing PMI for March 2024 edged up to an eleven month high of 51.5 with stronger expansion in production, rise in new orders and moderation in price pressures. In the BRICS economies barring South Africa, GDP growth for 2024 is projected to moderate marginally (Table V.2). The inflation scenario in these countries is expected to improve in 2024 for all barring Russia where inflation has been fuelled by the war, and China which is facing weak prices amidst a property slump and subdued consumer sentiment. Turning to high frequency indicators, the OECD composite leading indicators (CLIs) for February 2024 registered an uptick for most economies (Chart V.1a). The global composite PMI increased to 52.1 in February 2024 \u2013 its highest reading since July 2023 \u2013 as manufacturing PMI returned to expansion zone E: Estimate P: Projection *: Forex reserves for 2024 pertain to February 2024 for all countries except South Africa (January 2024) and India (March 2024). #: Gross debt refers to the nonfinancial public sector, excluding Eletrobras and Petrobras, and includes sovereign debt held by the central bank.

The momentum continued to be positive rising by 0.9 per cent (m-o-m) in January (Chart V.2b). Global merchandise trade volume recorded a modest recovery of 0.4 per cent (y-o-y) in January 2024, as strong trade recovery in EMEs more than offset the freight container pricing index that measures 40-feet container prices, seemed to be losing momentum t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P ) e g a r e v a 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A January and February due to the impact of attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea trade route. The attacks necessitated rerouting of maritime trade, inter alia, Europe and Asia via the South African Cape of Good Hope, leading to higher transit times, freight costs and war-risk premia. The latest reading of the WTO\u2019s goods trade barometer (100.6 in December 2023 slightly above the baseline value of 100) suggests that the merchandise trade could witness a modest recovery in early 2024; however, these gains could reverse due to geopolitical risks. In its WEO update (January 2024), the IMF projected world trade volume (goods and services) to grow at 3.3 per cent in 2024, lower than the historical average of 4.9 per cent, on account of rising trade distortions and geoeconomic fragmentation. Global commodity prices softened by 5.9 per cent (in terms of the Bloomberg commodity price index) during Q4:2023, reflecting moderation in the energy sub- index (Chart V.3a). The commodity prices, however remained volatile in Q1:2024 due to easing in the agriculture sub-index, especially grains and hardening in energy sub-index. Global food prices, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), softened by 2.2 per cent in Q4:2023 and edged down further by 1.6 per cent in Q1:2024 (up to February), primarily driven by correction in the prices of sugar, cereals and meat (Chart V.3b). Sugar prices, however, firmed up partially in Q1:2024. In contrast, the prices of dairy increased steadily throughout Q4:2023 and Q1:2024. , l b b r e p $ S U After staying elevated at US$ 90 per barrel in September-October due to output cuts by the OPEC+ and onset of the Israel-Hamas war, crude oil prices declined in Q4:2023 largely reflecting increase in non-OPEC supply, particularly from the US and Brazil, deteriorating demand prospects, and a seasonal moderation in demand (Chart V.3c). Oil prices ticked up in Q1:2024 in response to the Red Sea crisis, risk of conflagration of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the OPEC+ announcement of extension of voluntary cut for Q2:2024. Natural gas prices (according to World Bank\u2019s natural gas index) remained volatile in Q4:2023 as rising geo-political tensions pushed the prices, which was offset by increased supply, especially from the US. The price of natural gas moderated in Q1:2024 reflecting higher inventory levels and an improving supply outlook (Chart V.3c). and core inflation. In most countries, supply chain disruptions corrected, and central banks kept their monetary policy restrictive. Easing inflationary pressures also reflect fading energy price shocks and attenuating labour market tightness with a decline in job vacancies and a modest rise in unemployment. remained generally muted Wage growth has forestalling the formation of wage-price spirals. Notwithstanding the decline, inflation rules above target in most inflation-targeting AEs and about half of inflation-targeting EMDEs5 (Table V.3). Moreover, the inflation momentum (m-o-m change in the price Prices of base metals like iron and copper firmed up in Q4:2023 as demand conditions improved in China, the top consumer of base metals. Nickel prices, however, declined in Q4:2023 due to a supply glut, especially in Indonesia, before a marginal recovery in prices on improvement in demand for electronic vehicles lent support to prices in Q1:2024. Most base metals, including aluminium, iron and zinc, softened in Q1:2024 as supply of these metals increased amidst looming demand concerns, uncertainty over rate cuts by the US Fed and a cloudy growth outlook for China. Gold prices rallied in Q4 as financial markets priced in deeper policy rate cuts for 2024 as reflected in lower bond yields and a weaker US dollar. The hardening of gold prices continued in Q1:2024 to record high in March on growing expectations of interest rate cuts by the US Fed, coupled with demand by central banks and Chinese investors (Chart V.3d).

Goods inflation in major AEs has exhibited a notable decline while services inflation has remained relatively sticky (Box V.1). On the whole, near-term inflation expectations have fallen in major economies, with long-term expectations remaining anchored. Prices of services generally tend to increase faster than prices of goods due to their non-tradable nature (Balassa- Samuelson effect); higher income elasticity of demand for services; higher productivity growth in goods production than in services; and rising mark ups (ECB, 2009). In the long-run, however, the gap between both the inflation rates tends to close with either a rise in goods inflation or a decrease in services inflation (Peach et al., 2004). The magnitude of the response from goods inflation is generally much greater than the adjustment process for services inflation (Esteve et al., 2006). Emerging market economies (EMEs) Long run equation: Services inflation= \u03b2.Goods inflation + error correction Prior to COVID, co-movement of goods and services inflation was evident. Post the pandemic, however, demand-supply imbalances led to high and persistent inflation amidst tight labour markets, contact-intensive services being the worst affected. As consumer spending shifted towards essentials, goods inflation flared up vis- a-vis services inflation as demand for services declined, breaking the usual co-movement briefly. With easing of restrictions on movement of people and ebbing supply chain pressures, the demand for services surged again and services inflation replaced goods inflation as the main driver of headline inflation (Atkinson and Zhou, 2022). Long run equation: Goods inflation= \u03b2.Services inflation + error correction Long run equation: Services inflation= \u03b2.Goods inflation + error correction A panel regression of 15 economies (comprising both AEs and EMEs) for January 2009 to December 2023 indicates the presence of a cointegrating relationship between goods and services inflation. Accordingly, a vector error correction model (VECM) is estimated by the pooled mean group (PMG) approach (Pesaran et al., 1999). The results indicate that in the pre-COIVD period, coefficients of the error correction term in both goods and services inflation equations are negative and statistically significant (Table V.1.1). Thus, in case of a shock leading to deviation from equilibrium, both goods as well as services inflation adjust, with speed of adjustment in goods inflation being somewhat higher. For the full sample period (including COVID and post-COVID period), both services inflation and goods inflation converge towards equilibrium, at Long run equation: Goods inflation= \u03b2.Services inflation + error correction Notes: (1) Figures in parentheses are t-statistics. least in the short run. The long-run coefficient of services inflation in the goods inflation equation, is, however, insignificant possibly due to a huge shift towards goods consumption during COVID and surge in services consumption post COVID as mobility restrictions were lifted. According to the IMF\u2019s WEO update of January 2024, global inflation is projected to fall from 6.8 per cent in 2023 to 5.8 per cent in 2024 and further to 4.4 per cent in 2025. In the US, headline CPI inflation receded from 3.7 per cent in September 2023 to 3.2 per cent in February 2024, primarily due to decline in energy prices which were partially offset by rise in shelter prices. Core CPI inflation also moderated at a tardy pace from 4.1 per cent in September 2023 to 3.8 per cent in February 2024. Inflation in terms of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index \u2013 the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation \u2013 moderated from 3.4 per cent in September to 2.5 per cent in February (Chart V.4a), while core PCE inflation fell from 3.6 per cent to 2.8 per cent over the same period (Chart V.4b). In the Euro area, CPI inflation eased by 190 bps to 2.4 per cent in March 2024 from 4.3 per cent in September 2023. Core inflation (inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco) also moderated by 160 bps over the same period to 2.9 per cent in March, with non- energy industrial goods inflation declining more (from 4.1 per cent in September to 1.1 per cent in March) than services inflation (from 4.7 per cent in September to 4.0 per cent in March). In the UK, CPI headline inflation eased to 3.4 per cent in February 2024 from 6.7 per cent in September 2023, with core inflation declining by 160 bps to 4.5 per cent in February from 6.1 per cent in September. In Japan, CPI inflation (all items less fresh food), the Bank of Japan\u2019s inflation target metric, moderated steadily from 2.9 per cent in October 2023 to 2.0 per cent in January 2024, but reversed sharply to 2.8 per cent in February driven by inflation in prices of culture & recreation, and communication. Core inflation (inflation excluding both fresh food and energy) declined to 3.2 per cent in February from 4.2 per cent in September. Amongst major EMEs, CPI inflation in Brazil softened to 4.5 per cent in February 2024 from 5.2 per cent in September 2023 (Chart V.4c). In Russia, it edged up to 7.7 per cent in February from 6.0 per cent in September, partly due to soaring government spending on defence. In South Africa, CPI inflation has remained volatile within the upper tolerance band of the central bank\u2019s target since September 2023, reaching 5.6 per cent in February 2024. China, on the other hand, has been experiencing deflation (fall in price level, y-o-y) \u2013 from the no-inflation point in September 2023 to a deflation of 0.8 per cent in January 2024 \u2013 reflecting subdued consumption spending and weak consumer confidence amidst the property sector crisis. In February, however, China exited deflation as inflation rose to 0.7 per cent on robust spending during the Lunar New Year holiday. Like AEs, core inflation in EMEs also remained elevated (Chart V.4d). During Q4:2023 and Q1:2024, monetary policy cycles diverged with the growing deviation in growth- inflation dynamics. Most central banks across AEs maintained their policy rates at restrictive levels. On the other hand, major central banks across EMEs either paused or cut their policy rates, as convergence of inflation towards the target on a durable basis appeared to be in sight. continued to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25-5.50 per cent in all its subsequent meetings (Chart V.5a). As per the Summary of Economic Projections released in March 2024, the majority of Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) participants expected the federal funds rate to be in the range of 4.50-4.75 per cent by end-2024, indicating a rate cut of 75 bps in 2024. The FOMC members, however, agreed that it would not be appropriate to reduce the target range until they gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards the 2 per cent target. The US Fed also continued with its balance sheet reduction policy. The US Fed had started its tightening cycle in March 2022, but paused it in September 2023 and has The ECB also kept its three key interest rates unchanged in each of its October and December s t n i o p s i s a B s t n i o p s i s a B y a w c i l b u p e R h c e z C a i l a r t s u A d n a l a e Z w e N d n a l e c I a e r o K h t u o S l i z a r B a c i r f A h t u o S o c i x e M 2023, and January and March 2024 policy meetings. It indicated that it would continue to follow a data- dependent approach to determine the appropriate level and duration of restriction and to maintain the policy rates at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. Besides, the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) portfolio continues to decline as principal payments from maturing securities are no longer reinvested. It, however, intends to continue to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) during the first half of 2024 and to reduce the PEPP portfolio by \u20ac7.5 billion per month on average in H2:2024 before discontinuing reinvestments at the end of 2024. The ECB announced changes in operational framework for implementing monetary policy on March 13, 2024 that sets out how Governing Council would steer short- term money market rates in line with its monetary policy decisions as Eurosystem normalises its balance sheet6. After pausing its rate hike cycle in September 2023, the Bank of England (BoE) maintained its policy February and March 2024 and judged that monetary policy will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long to return inflation to the target. maintained status quo in all their meetings during Q4:2023 and Q1:2024. After keeping its policy rate Australia raised the cash rate by 25 bps in November and maintained status quo in its subsequent meetings Similarly, the Norges Bank paused its rate hike in November 2023, but raised its policy rate by 25 bps in December 2023 before pausing again in its January and March 2024 meetings. The Czech National Bank, which had maintained a pause since August 2022, 6 The ECB would reduce the spread between Deposit Facility Rate (DFR) and Main Refinancing Operations (MRO) to 15 bps from 25 bps effective September 18, 2024. Liquidity will be provided through various instruments, including (i) short-term credit operations (i.e., MROs); (ii) three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs); and (iii) structural longer-term credit operations. Both MROs and three-month LTROs will continue to be conducted through fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment. embarked on monetary easing cycle by cutting its key rate by 25 bps in December 2023 and 50 bps each in February and March 2024 policy meetings. The Swiss National Bank also began its easing cycle with a 25 bps rate cut in its March meeting. At the same time, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintained an accommodative stance with the overnight interest rate on hold at minus 0.1 per cent till late-March 2024. In its October 2023 meeting, the BoJ increased flexibility in the conduct of yield curve control (YCC) with the upper bound of 1.0 per cent for the yields as reference vis- a-vis 0.5 per cent earlier. In its March 2024 meeting, however, the BoJ became the last central bank to exit the negative rate as it switched from interest rate of (-) 0.1 per cent on Policy Rate Balances to encouraging the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around 0 to 0.1 per cent. It also abandoned the policy of Quantitative and Qualitative Easing (QQE) with YCC7. In the BRICS, the Banco Central do Brasil cut the Selic rate in November and December 2023 and January and March 2024 by 50 bps each after it had embarked on an easing cycle in August 2023. The South African Reserve Bank and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) kept their policy rates unchanged in all their meetings held in Q4:2023 and Q1:2024. The PBoC, however, continued its accommodative stance by lowering the reserve requirement ratio by 50 bps in February 2024, to provide a liquidity boost to the financial system. It also lowered its benchmark five-year loan prime rate by 25 bps, the largest cut since it was introduced in 2019, to boost real estate demand. The Bank of Russia (BoR) continued its tightening cycle that started in July 2023 by increasing the policy rate by 200 bps and 100 bps in October and December 2023 meetings, respectively, prompted by inflationary pressures and a depreciating rouble. It, however, kept the policy rate Among Asian EMEs, the Bank of Thailand kept the benchmark rate unchanged in its November 2023 and February 2024 meetings. The Bank Indonesia raised its key rate in October 2023 by 25 bps before maintaining a pause in all its subsequent meetings. In Latin America, the central bank of Mexico held its policy rate unchanged in all meetings since May 2023, before embarking on a policy easing cycle in March 2024 with a 25 bps rate cut. After keeping the key rate unchanged since June 2023, the central bank of Colombia commenced a monetary policy easing cycle by cutting its benchmark rate by 25 bps each in December 2023 and January 2024 and 50 bps in March. Chile lowered its policy rate by 225 bps to 7.25 per cent during October 2023 - February 2024. Peru cut its policy rate by 25 bps each in all the 6 meetings held during October 2023 - February 2024, before maintaining a pause in its March meeting. Among European EMEs, Hungary switched gears by commencing an easing cycle in October 2023, reducing the policy rate by 75 bps in each of the meetings held in October, November and December 2023 and January 2024, followed by a rate cut of 100 bps in February and 75 bps in March. Poland cut its policy rate by 25 bps in October 2023 and kept it on hold in all its subsequent meetings. The central bank of Turkey, on the other hand, raised its policy rate by 1500 bps cumulatively between October 2023 and January 2024 on the top of 2150 bps hike during June-September 2023 before holding it unchanged at 45.0 per cent in its February 2024 policy as it fights elevated and rising inflation and a weakening currency. It, however, increased its policy rate again by 500 bps in March meeting citing the continuing need to counter climbing inflation (68.5 per cent in March 2024 from 61.5 per cent in September 2023). 7 The BoJ decided to (i) continue its Japanese Government Bond (JGB) purchases of broadly the same amount as before, while making nimble operations in case of a rapid rise in long-term interest rates, (ii) discontinue purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs); and (iii) gradually reduce the amount of purchases of CPs and corporate bonds and discontinue the purchases in about one year. Global financial markets witnessed large swings in Q4:2023 and Q1:2024 in response to fluctuating perceptions on monetary policy trajectories, stickiness of inflation and strength of economic activity. Global equity markets corrected in October over anticipation of \u2018higher for longer\u2019 monetary policy stances but rallied afterwards as a few systemic central banks signalled interest rate cuts in the near future. Overall, bond yields have moderated since the last MPR. The US dollar pared gains in Q4:2023 but strengthened later in Q1:2024. The EME currencies broadly strengthened since last MPR. In terms of MSCI world index, equity markets gained 19.3 per cent since end-September, reflecting gains in both AEs and EMEs (Chart V.6a). Among AEs, the US S&P 500 shed gains in October over \u2018higher for longer\u2019 monetary policy stances and tardy pace of disinflation. It, however, gained starting November as the Fed signalled a possible end of its rate hiking cycle and rate cuts in 2024. Overall, the US S&P 500 index rose by 22.5 per cent during October 2023 and March 2024. European stock markets tracked the US markets, paring gains in October and rallying afterwards with intermittent episodes of volatility as inflation slowed down and the euro area narrowly missed recession. The UK\u2019s stock indices gained by 1.6 per cent in Q4:2023 and by 2.8 per cent in Q1:2024 over a sharp drop in consumer prices though the indices exhibited volatility, especially in Q1, over GDP concerns. The Japanese market outperformed its peers on continuation of ultra-accommodative monetary policy by the BoJ. Tracking global cues in Q4:2023, EME equities, barring China and Russia, gained as they reaped benefits of an early commencement of the tightening cycle leading to lower inflation prints (Chart V.6b). Chinese stocks crashed due to its flagging real estate sector, high unemployment and deflation. It has, however, exhibited signs of recovery since early February 2024 as a wide range of support measures eased bearish sentiment and capital inflows in to equity markets resumed. Overall, in Q1:2024, EME equities soared, barring those of Brazil and South Africa. Sovereign bond yields softened across major AEs in Q4:2023 as systemic central banks signalled the end of tightening cycles and a possible reversal.

Taking b: Portfolio Flows to EMEs n o i l l i b $ S U conditions. Going forward, the chances of hard landing have receded and risks to the outlook are in balance. While continuation of geopolitical tensions, elevated public debt amidst tight financial conditions, weak recovery in China, geoeconomic fragmentation and extreme weather events pose downside risks to the outlook, faster disinflation and slower withdrawal of fiscal stimulus may provide upsides. Changing perceptions on the monetary policy trajectory and persistence of geopolitical conflicts are imparting volatility to global financial markets. Growth prospects in EMEs remain bright though weak global demand, tight financial conditions pose downside risks to their outlook. While inflation has eased across countries with restrictive policies and easing of supply shocks, economies, and the last mile of disinflation is likely to be gradual. Central banks will need to modulate their monetary policies cautiously to support the descent of inflation to the target while supporting the nascent ", "file4": "The outlook for domestic economic activity remains resilient in spite of large supply shocks that have pushed up the trajectory of headline inflation. Energy and food price volatility, geopolitical hostilities, tightening external financial conditions and climate shocks are the key risks to the outlook. Monetary policy remains focused on aligning inflation with the target to pave the path for sustained growth in the medium-term. in response to extended output cuts by key producing Global economic activity and trade are slowing, although unevenly across geographies and sectors. Tightening financial conditions in response to monetary actions to address still elevated inflation, growing persisting geoeconomic fragmentation render the outlook fragile. Manufacturing activity is contracting across many countries, while services are relatively resilient. Headline inflation has been gradually easing across the world, however, in most countries, it remains elevated in relation to targets. Core inflation is moderating but at a tardy pace and services inflation is sticky. These concerns are reflected in 'higher for longer' monetary policy settings. In some countries, however, the monetary policy tightening cycle is complete or nearing it or even in accommodation in response to weakening economic activity. countries. Food prices are volatile on supply concerns arising from the breakdown of the Black Sea deal on Ukrainian grain movements and the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon. Turning to the domestic economy, activity was supported in H1:2023-24 by private consumption and fixed investment, although adverse external conditions are being reflected in a prolonged contraction in net exports. Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 7.8 per cent (year-on-year, indicators for Q2 suggest that the momentum in activity is being maintained. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) is being buoyed by services Headline CPI inflation had moderated from an average Market expectations relating to the global economic outlook are fluctuating widely and sensitive to every incoming information, imparting high volatility. In September, US sovereign bond yields touched their highest levels since the global financial crisis, and the yield curve has seen its longest period of inversion since 1980. Credit growth in major economies is decelerating in response to monetary tightening. After strong gains in the first half of 2023, global equity markets retreated in Q3 (July-September). The US dollar depreciated to a 15-month low in mid- July but has recovered subsequently on better-than- expected US economic data. Crude oil prices firmed up sharply to around US$ 95 per barrel in September response to monetary policy actions and supply side measures. Reversing these gains under the impact of sporadic food supply shocks, inflation jumped to 7.4 other hand, core inflation (i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel) has been gradually ebbing down to sub-5 per 2023 working its way into the economy, the monetary policy committee (MPC) kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent through H1, and it remains firmly committed to aligning inflation with the target going forward. When the MPC met in April 2023, the global economy was going through a period of heightened volatility in the wake of banking sector turmoil in some advanced economies (AEs). Domestic CPI headline inflation was ruling above the upper threshold of the tolerance band in January and February, but was expected to soften with a record rabi foodgrains production, easing input cost conditions and normalisation of supply chain pressures. CPI inflation was projected at 5.2 per cent for 2023-24, 10 bps lower than the February projection. Domestic economic activity was seen to be holding up well, and the real GDP growth projection for 2023-24 was raised to 6.5 per cent from 6.4 per cent in the February meeting. Considering these factors and that previous rate hikes were still working through the system, the MPC unanimously decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, but with a readiness to act, should the situation so warrant. The MPC decided by a majority of 5-1 to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth. inflation trajectory from a spike in vegetable prices. Factoring in the skewed south-west monsoon outturn, the growing likelihood of an El Ni\u00f1o event and the worsening global food prices outlook, the inflation projection for 2023-24 was revised upwards by 30 bps to 5.4 per cent while the April 2023 projection for real GDP was kept unchanged. Taking into account the cumulative policy repo rate increase undertaken thus far, the MPC unanimously decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent with preparedness to undertake policy responses. With a 5 to 1 vote, the MPC reiterated its stance of withdrawal of accommodation. The MPC\u2019s voting pattern reflects the diversity in individual members\u2019 assessments, expectations and policy preferences, a characteristic also reflected in voting patterns of other central banks (Table I.1). III analyse macroeconomic Chapters developments relating to inflation and economic (April\u2013September activity At the time of the June 2023 meeting, CPI headline inflation had fallen to 4.7 per cent (April 2023 print) from an average of 6.2 per cent during the previous quarter. The MPC noted that the moderation in CPI headline inflation reflected the combined and continuing impact of monetary policy tightening, supply augmenting measures and the fuller impact of the previous rate hikes which should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months. Against this backdrop, the MPC unanimously voted again to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent and with a 5-1 vote to continue with its stance of withdrawal of accommodation. In the run up to the August 2023 meeting, headline CPI inflation picked up to 4.8 per cent in June, with sizeable upside pressures on the near-term headline r e p $ S U 2023). Turning to the baseline assumptions, first, international crude prices have exhibited sizeable two-way movements in H1, easing in April amidst a banking crisis in the US and underwhelming Chinese recovery, but they moved higher beginning July, with Brent crude crossing US dollar (US$) 90 per barrel in September due to production cuts referred to earlier, with some correction in early October. Geopolitical tensions impart significant uncertainty to the outlook (Chart I.1.a and Chart I.1.b). The \u2018crack\u2019 spread \u2013 the wedge between global petroleum product prices and crude prices \u2013 is elevated in view of demand-supply refinery mismatches (Chart I.1.c). Taking into account these developments, the baseline assumption for crude price (Indian basket) is retained at US$ 85 per barrel (Table I.2). Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. Second, the nominal exchange rate of the Indian rupee or INR has moved in both directions around the April baseline, varying in a range of INR 81.7-83.3 per US$ in H1. Taking into consideration the uncertainty around US dollar movements, the ebbs and flows of global capital, and international crude oil prices, the baseline assumption for the exchange rate is revised to INR 82.5 per US dollar. Third, multiple headwinds \u2013 tighter monetary and fiscal policies, reduced pent-up demand, financial stability risks, continued geopolitical challenges and geoeconomic fragmentation \u2013 weigh heavily on global growth prospects. The global purchasing managers\u2019 (PMI) for manufacturing has remained in contraction mode since September 2022, while the services PMI is moderating since May 2023, albeit still in expansion mode. In its July Looking ahead, the sharp spike in food prices, especially of vegetables, has started correcting (Chapter II). The three months and one year ahead median inflation expectations of urban households fell by 90 and 40 bps, respectively, to 9.1 per cent and 9.9 per cent in the September 2023 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey1 vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round. Notably, inflation expectations fell to a single digit for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Note: Net response is the difference between the share of respondents reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism. The range is -100 to 100. A positive/ negative value of net response is considered as optimistic/pessimistic from the view point of respondent firms. Therefore, higher positive values of selling prices indicate increase in output prices while lower values for the cost of raw materials/cost of inputs indicate higher input price pressures and vice versa.

A textual analysis of the Reserve Bank\u2019s MPRs shows that their tone has been in consonance with the evolving price and output developments, which strengthens the monetary policy communication channel (Box I.1). pressures to output prices. The downside risks could Central banks communicate through a variety of channels \u2013 monetary policy statements; speeches; press conferences; minutes; testimonies; and monetary policy (or inflation) reports. A growing literature is undertaking a quantitative textual analysis of these documents, especially monetary policy reports (MPRs), to assess the communication tone (Cherry and Tong, 2023). A textual analysis of the Reserve Bank\u2019s 15 MPRs (Chapters 1-3) since April 2016 is undertaken by using a pre- determined list of positive and negative words (Loughran and McDonald, 2011). The quantitative estimate of MPR\u2019s tone and subjectivity is obtained by estimating two parameters - Polarity Ratio6 and Subjectivity Ratio7. Communication can be more effective if it is easily understood by the general public. For this, the readability of the MPRs is checked using Flesch\u2013Kincaid (FK) Grade Level and Gunning-Fog (FOG) indices (Ferrara and Angino, 2022). The scores provided by these indices can be interpreted as the number of years of education required to understand a text. The higher the score, the greater the complexity of the language used. are the number of words where matched with the pre-determined list in each report and The tone of the MPRs, as seen from the polarity score, is within the neutral range (-0.5 to +0.5) and has moved in line with the evolving price and output developments (Chart I.1.1). The MPR has turned more objective over time, as indicated by the downward sloping subjectivity index. According to the readability indices, the MPRs require at least a high school education for understanding9 them, notwithstanding some recent improvement. is the total number of words used. 6 The polarity score is a ratio between -1 and 1. A score in the range of -1 to -0.5 typically indicates negative sentiment, between -0.5 and 0.5 neutral sentiment, and 0.5 to 1 positive sentiment. 7 The subjectivity score captures the number of words that carry sentiment as a proportion of total number of words. 8 Complex words are words with three or more syllables, and that are not proper nouns. 9 This is in line with literature whereby central bank monetary policy press documents are generally observed to have FK and FOG scores in the range of 12-18 years and 17-23 years, respectively. o i t a R o i t a R o i t a R Note: Shaded area in Chart a indicates neutral sentiment for polarity ratio.

Domestic economic activity is being supported by robust agricultural performance, sustained buoyancy in contact-intensive services, the boost to investment from the government\u2019s thrust on capital expenditure, above trend capacity utilisation in manufacturing, double digit credit growth, and healthier corporate and bank balance sheets. Slowing global growth, the drag from exports, geopolitical risks and volatile global financial conditions, however, weigh heavily on the outlook.

Consumers\u2019 optimism for the year ahead, measured by the future expectations optimistic about demand conditions in Q3:2023-24 (Chart I.8a). While the optimism of services sector companies waned in Q3 vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round, infrastructure sector companies remain upbeat in terms of the overall business situation (Charts I.8b and I.8c). Recent surveys by other agencies signal a mixed picture on business expectations relative to the previous round (Table I.4). Manufacturing and services firms in the PMI surveys for September 2023 exhibited optimism for the year ahead. The professional forecasters polled in the September 2023 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey expect real GDP growth at 6.3 per cent in Q2:2023-24, 5.8 per cent in Q3, 5.4 per cent in Q4 and 6.0-6.4 per cent in H1:2024-25 (Chart I.9). index, remains upbeat on improved expectations about the general economic situation, employment, and income conditions (Chart I.7).10 In the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey of July-September 2023, manufacturing firms are Taking into account the baseline assumptions, survey indicators and model forecasts, real GDP growth is expected at 6.5 per cent in 2023-24 \u2013 6.5 per cent in Q2; 6.0 per cent in Q3; and 5.7 per cent in Q4 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path 10 The Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 (13 cities in the previous rounds) and the results of the September 2023 round are based on responses from 6,077 respondents.

For 2024-25, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 6.5 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 6.3-6.6 per cent. There are upside and downside risks to this baseline growth path. The upside risks emanate from a stronger-than-expected rebound in contact-intensive services, some of which have still to catch up to their pre-pandemic levels; a more vigorous boost to private investment from government\u2019s capex push and healthier corporate balance sheets; more resilient global growth; and an early resolution of the geopolitical conflict. On the contrary, an escalation in geopolitical tensions, a further hardening of international crude oil, food and commodity prices, a sharper loss of momentum in global trade and demand, and frequent weather-related disturbances due to climate change pose downside risks to the baseline growth path. The projections of growth and inflation presented in this chapter are contingent upon the baseline assumptions set out in Table I.2. These assumptions remain subject to a range of uncertainties as elucidated earlier. Against this backdrop, this section explores plausible alternative scenarios to assess the balance of risks to the baseline projections. horizon, protracted geopolitical hostilities, supply Global growth is slowing after a relatively strong outturn in H1:2023. There are downside risks to the baseline assumption from the elevated inflation trajectory in major economies, an extended phase of tight financial conditions from expectations of interest rates remaining elevated over a prolonged China. Global inflation, though moderating, remains tight labour markets in several AEs. There is a strong inflation across countries (Box I.2), which could exert The sharp rise in global commodity prices, the widespread supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine, and strong demand due to large monetary and fiscal stimulus led to an upsurge in inflation across geographies in 2022 (Chart I.2.1a and b). Structural factors such as movements in international trade and financial flows and more integrated supply chains added to the synchronisation of inflation (Ha et al., 2019). To empirically assess the role of such global (common) factors, a Generalised Dynamic Factor Model (GDFM) is estimated for headline as well as core inflation for a sample of 26 countries11 including both AEs and emerging market economies (EMEs) for the period January 2012- May 2023 (Equation 1 below). is the idiosyncratic (i.e., country- component whereas specific) component of inflation. The common component captures the impact of a common global shock or factor on country-level inflation filtered through country (Forni et loadings represented by the lag polynomial al., 2000). The global component is the weighted average of the common component of the sample economies, with the weights being their respective shares in the aggregate GDP at market exchange rates. The empirical analysis indicates that the share of the global component12 in the variance of inflation is (i) higher for AEs than EMEs (both for headline and core) on the one hand and (ii) higher for headline than core inflation on the other (Chart I.2.2 a and b). Thus, the co-movement in inflation is stronger in AEs relative to EMEs and in headline inflation relative to core. The share of variance explained by the global common factor for core inflation was muted in the pre- is headline or core inflation of country i at time represents the common 11 The sample AE countries are: Canada, Czech Republic, European Union, Israel, Japan, Norway, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom and United States. The sample EMEs are: Brazil, Colombia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Romania, South Africa and Thailand. 12 Based on 36-month moving average. pandemic period but has surged in the pandemic phase and remains elevated. A deep dive into the potential determinants shows that the global component is highly persistent and driven by international crude prices, global food inflation and US dollar appreciation for headline as well as core inflation, and for AEs as well as EMEs. The volatility in financial markets \u2013 represented by the VIX \u2013 is a significant driver of the common component of core inflation, but not of headline inflation. Shocks to global crude and food prices and the US dollar have stronger impact on the common component of headline inflation than that of core inflation (Table I.2.1).

In such a scenario, if global growth is 100 bps lower than the baseline, domestic growth and inflation could be around 30 bps and 15 bps, respectively, below their baseline trajectories. Conversely, if inflation in major economies retreats faster than anticipated, geopolitical tensions ebb and the stimuli measures are able to reverse the slowdown in the Chinese economy quickly, global growth may remain resilient. In this scenario, if global growth is higher by 50 bps, domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by around 15 bps and Global crude oil prices have remained highly volatile over the past six months. An escalation of geopolitical crude prices. Assuming crude oil price to be 10 per cent above the baseline, domestic inflation and growth could be higher by 30 bps and weaker by around 15 bps, respectively. Conversely, a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions, improved supply from non- OPEC producers and alternative energy sources, and a further weakening of global demand owing to aggressive monetary policy actions by central banks may pull down crude oil prices. If crude oil prices fall by 10 per cent relative to the baseline and assuming their full pass-through to domestic product prices, inflation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 15 bps to growth (Charts I.11a and I.12a). The INR has fluctuated in both directions against the US dollar over the past six months. Looking ahead, the \u2018higher for longer\u2019 interest rate scenario in the US and other AEs could keep risk aversion towards EME assets elevated and impinge upon capital flows. Global foreign direct investment flows are also slowing. Crude oil and other commodity prices could harden over the baseline. Should the INR depreciate by 5 per cent over the baseline, inflation could edge up by around 35 bps while GDP growth could be higher by around 25 bps through stimulating exports. On the other hand, the Indian economy remains the bright spot in the global economy and is pivotal to the global outlook. These developments, along with a strengthening of domestic macroeconomic fundamentals, could enhance India\u2019s attraction as a destination for foreign investors. In this scenario, if the INR appreciates by 5 per cent relative to the baseline, inflation and GDP growth could moderate by around 35 bps and 25 bps, respectively (Charts I.11b and I.12b). Food inflation exhibited sizeable volatility in H1:2023- 24, driven by large shocks to vegetable prices due to extreme weather events which are occurring more frequently and with more force. The risk of El Ni\u00f1o has materialised, resulting in the driest August on record, and water reservoir levels have dipped below the decadal average levels. These developments impart a heightened uncertainty to the kharif and the ensuing rabi crops. The global food price outlook is also subject to significant upside risks from the historically unprecedented heatwave sweeping across the globe. All these developments could impart sizeable upside to the domestic food inflation trajectory and could raise headline inflation by around 100 bps over the baseline. On the other hand, given the robust kharif sowing, improved irrigation facilities, the IOD turning positive, ample foodgrains buffer stocks and effective supply management could help ease food inflationary pressures and pull headline inflation 50 bps below the baseline (Charts I.11b and I.12b). Economic activity in India is expected to remain backed up by strong macroeconomic fundamentals. Large supply shocks are, however, leading to recurrent bouts of inflation and pose challenge to the overall outlook. The uneven south-west monsoon, El Ni\u00f1o formation and the volatile global food prices outlook impart significant uncertainty to the outlook of food and headline inflation, even as core inflation is showing some signs of easing. Thus, price developments warrant heightened vigil and monetary policy remains focused on aligning inflation with the target. A firm anchoring of inflationary expectations can pave the path for sustained growth in the medium-term. Geopolitical hostilities, stubborn global inflation, volatile global financial markets and energy prices, and climate shocks are the key risks to the growth and the inflation outlook. Headline inflation has been undergoing considerable volatility, breaching the upper tolerance band of 6 per cent in July-August, due to repeated supply side shocks even as core inflation has been moderating. Industrial and farm input price pressures have eased while nominal rural wage growth has been firming up. Going forward, the inflation trajectory will be shaped by weather conditions and the evolution of global food and crude oil prices. Since the April 2023 MPR, consumer price index (CPI) headline inflation1 has seen considerable volatility, has eased between February and August 2023 by 1.3 percentage points (Chart II.1). moving in a wide range of 4.3 per cent to 7.4 per cent during February-August 2023. It initially moderated May 2023. These gains were reversed from June on inflation surged to 7.4 per cent in July. In August, the onset of vegetable price correction softened it to 6.8 per cent. Core inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel)2 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections, if any, and the underlying reasons thereof. The April 2023 MPR had projected inflation at 5.1 per cent for Q1:2023-24 and 5.4 per cent for Q2 (Chart II.2). In Q1, actual inflation at 4.6 per cent trailed projection by 50 basis points (bps), as food inflation turned out to be lower than anticipated due to a muted seasonal pick-up in vegetables prices during April-May and a sustained decline in prices of edible oil. In Q2 (July- August), on the other hand, the actual outcome at 7.1 per cent exceeded the projection by 170 bps due to a steep rise in vegetables prices, particularly those of tomatoes. In fact, vegetable prices and even overall food prices registered the highest month over month increase in the current CPI series (2012=100) in July, resulting in the projection error. 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - g u A During H1:2023-24, headline inflation movements benefited from strong favourable base effects3 averaging one percentage point during March-May 2023, which pulled down headline inflation from 6.4 per cent in February to 4.3 per cent in May. Thereafter, a pick-up in the price momentum, 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in the all-India consumer price index (CPI) produced by the National Statistical Office (NSO). 2 Core CPI, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups \u2018food and beverages\u2019 and \u2018fuel and light\u2019 from the headline CPI. 3 A change in CPI year-on-year (y-o-y) inflation between any two months is the difference between the current month-on-month (m-o-m) change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details, see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. alongside waning base effects led to an uptick in headline inflation to 4.9 per cent in June. In July, an all-time high momentum in food prices (5.7 per cent) and strong momentum in fuel (1.8 per cent) led to a record monthly momentum of 290 bps in headline inflation, pushing the y-o-y inflation to 7.4 per cent. In August, a decline in momentum, along with favourable base effects helped soften inflation to 6.8 per cent (Chart II.3). Act alu s The CPI inflation distribution during 2023 vis-\u00e0-vis the earlier years was marked by a significant increase in standard deviation, mirroring the large variation in inflation rates, even as the mean of the distribution fell to 5.8 per cent in 2023 (January-August) from 6.8 per cent in the corresponding period of 2022 d: CPI excluding Food and Fuel s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - g u A Note: The imputed CPI prints for April and May 2020 have been regarded as a break in the CPI series.

Inflation variability increased substantially across the CPI sub-groups during July-August 2023 following the vegetable price shock (Chart II.5). the CPI basket, driven largely by prices of goods Diffusion indices (DIs)4 softened during March-May 2023 as the fall in inflation was accompanied by a adjusted annualised rate (saar) basis were the norm 4 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. The higher the reading above 50, the broader is the expansion or generalisation of price increases; the further is the reading below 50, the broader is the price decline across items. across the CPI basket, there was a marked slowdown in the magnitude of price increases since March 2023 as measured by threshold DI5 (Chart II.6b). During June- August, the diffusion of price increases broadened across goods and services, though a majority of items registered price increases of less than 4 per cent on a saar basis. A historical decomposition of inflation using a vector autoregression (VAR)6 model indicates that the moderation in inflation in Q1:2023-24 came from a waning of supply side shocks as also from the disinflation engendered by the transmission of past monetary policy actions. Of the 270 bps moderation in headline inflation (from 7.3 per cent in April-June 2022 to 4.6 per cent in April-June 2023), 130 bps was due to monetary policy tightening (a cumulative increase of 250 bps in the policy rate) and the remaining 140 bps was due to the waning of supply shocks. The jump in inflation in Q2:2023-24 (up to August) was entirely due to adverse supply shocks even though the restraining effects of cumulative monetary tightening were still playing out (Chart II.7a). Goods inflation (with a weight of 76.6 per cent in overall CPI) contributed around three-fourths of headline inflation during March-May 2023 and services (with a weight of 23.4 per cent) the remaining one-fourth. By August, the contribution of goods to overall inflation rose to 81 per cent (Chart II.7b). Within goods, perishable items (non- durable with a 7-day recall7), particularly fruits, vegetables, and other food items such as eggs, meat, fish and milk were the main drivers. The contribution of semi-perishable items (non-durable goods with a 30-day recall) such as petroleum products, household items (particularly, washing soaps and powders), personal care items (like toiletries) and medicines declined from 46 per cent in March 2023 to 29 per cent in August. Similarly, the contribution of durables (goods with a 365-day recall) like clothing and footwear items, motor cycle/scooter, and household goods (furniture and electronic items) to overall inflation declined to 9 per cent in August 2023 from 14 per cent in March 2023. With the gradual moderation in the international the commodity prices since September 2022, contribution of imported components8 to headline inflation turned negative towards the end of 2022, driven down by the y-o-y fall in the prices of edible oils, energy, electronic goods parts, and polymer (Chart II.7c). With the pick-up in the global commodity prices in July 2023, primarily driven by energy prices, the negative contribution of imported inflation lessened to (-)1.2 per cent in August. 5 Threshold diffusion indices capture the dispersion of price increases in CPI basket beyond the specified saar thresholds of 4 per cent and 6 per cent. 6 Historical decomposition estimates the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period (Q4:2010-11 to Q2:2023-24) based on a vector autoregression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 crude oil prices (US$ per barrel); exchange rate (INR per US$), asset price (BSE Sensex), CPI; the output gap; rural wages; the policy repo rate; and money supply (M3). All variables other than policy repo rate are y-o-y growth rates. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et; where et represents a vector of shocks. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. 7 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Under MMRP, data are collected on expenditures incurred for frequently purchased items \u2013 edible oil, eggs, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, spices, beverages, processed foods, pan, tobacco and intoxicants \u2013 during the last seven days; for clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods, during the last 365 days; and for all other food, fuel and light, miscellaneous goods and services including non-institutional medical services, rents and taxes, data relate to the last 30 days. 8 Global commodities that drive domestic prices include petroleum products, coal, electronic goods, gold, silver, chemical products, metal products, textiles, cereals, milk products, and vegetables oils \u2013 these together have a weight of 36.4 per cent in the CPI basket. pulses, and spices remained elevated. Inflation in oils Food and beverages (weight of 45.9 per cent in the CPI basket) inflation, which was muted in Q1:2023- 24 at 4.1 per cent, increased sharply to 10.6 per cent in July, led by the steep increase in vegetables prices. With corrections in the vegetable prices on fresh crop arrivals, food inflation moderated to 9.2 per cent in August. CPI food inflation excluding vegetables, however, increased to 6.4 per cent during July-August from 5.4 per cent in Q1 as inflation in respect of cereals, and fats remained in deflation, partially offsetting in the food basket (Chart II.8). The sharp increase in vegetables prices in July was due to supply disruptions caused by heavy rainfall and floods in the northern Uneven rainfall distribution, delayed sowing of rice, of spices contributed to the hardening of prices in cereals and spices. prepared meals; non-alcoholic beverages; and eggs \u2013 were lower than their long-term averages (Chart II.9). The overall food price build-up in 2023-24 was higher than historical patterns, driven by vegetables, spices, pulses, sugar and cereals. The price build-ups in six of the twelve sub-groups \u2013 fruits; meat and fish; milk; Inflation in cereals (weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group) remained elevated during April-August 2023 (Chart II.10). After a decline between March and May Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI - food and beverages.

Rice prices increased sharply as uneven rainfall distribution led to delay in kharif sowing. However, sowing eventually picked up (1.9 per cent over last year as on September 29, 2023) on account of revival in monsoon. As part of the supply side interventions to improve domestic supply and ease price pressures, the Government (i) announced to release a cumulative 5 million tonnes of wheat and 2.5 million tonnes of rice in the open market in a phased manner; (ii) imposed an export duty on parboiled rice, restricted exports of non- basmati rice and levied stock limits on wheat; and (iii) stopped the diversion of subsidised rice to distilleries for ethanol production. Note: Figures in parentheses indicate items' weights in CPI-vegetables. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. After being in deflation during November 2022-June 2023, prices of vegetables (weight of 6.0 per cent in the CPI and 13.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) increased sharply to record a y-o-y inflation of 37.4 per cent in July 2023, due to weather related crop damage and disrupted supply chains in North India. A pick- up in market arrivals and improved supply conditions caused inflation in this category to moderate to 26.1 per cent in August (Chart II.11). Among key vegetables, tomato prices, on a y-o-y basis, surged by 202.1 per cent in July. A revival in market arrivals moderated tomato price inflation to 180.3 per cent in August 2023. Potato prices have remained in deflation since February 2023 on account of higher production last year (an increase of 6.3 per cent in 2022-23 as per 1st advance estimates (AE) over 2021-22). Onion prices, which were in deflation during September 2021-May 2023, recorded an inflation of 23.2 per cent in August 2023 on lower production [(-) 2.1 per cent in 2022-23 1st AE over 2021-22] as well as low quality of the rabi crop reducing shelf life. Overall, the record price increase in July propelled the tomato, onion, and potato (TOP) group price build-up (July- August over March) to one of the largest ever seen in the current CPI series (Chart II.12a). Vegetables excluding TOP \u2013 ginger, garlic, cauliflower, cabbage, brinjal and green chillies \u2013 also witnessed high price pressures in July due to rain induced supply disturbances. The price build-up in non-TOP vegetables during 2023-24 (up to August) was unprecedented by historical patterns and contributed substantially to the spike in vegetables inflation (Chart II.12b). With the improving supply situation, the prices of vegetables excluding TOP corrected in August. To rein in prices, the government announced sale of tomatoes at concessional rates at several markets in the country during July-August 2023 and release of onions (under the Price Stabilisation Fund) at subsidised rates from the buffer stocks. Inflation in fruits (weight of 2.9 per cent in the CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages group) has moderated since April 2023 on the back of higher production (0.2 per cent as per 2022-23 1st AE over 2021-22). However, there was an uptick in inflation in July-August 2023, primarily driven by a rise in apple prices to 21.3 per cent (y-o-y) in August from an average of 5.1 per cent in Q1:2023-24 as floods in Himachal Pradesh damaged apple plantations and led to supply disruptions. Mango prices remained in deflation since April 2023, while banana price inflation moderated from 21.8 per cent in March 2023 to 2.2 per cent in August on the back of comfortable production. masoor under the Price Support Scheme (PSS) for 2023-24 to encourage higher sowing acreage; and (iii) decided to release tur from the national buffer in a calibrated manner. Inflation in pulses (weight of 2.4 per cent in the CPI and 5.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) increased gradually, with a substantial price build-up from April leading to a print of 13.0 per cent in August 2023. The uptick came from lower production and deficient kharif sowing. As per the 3rd AE of 2022-23, the kharif production of pulses was lower than the final estimates for 2021-22, particularly for tur and urad ((-) 18.7 per cent and (-) 3.2 per cent, respectively). Owing to the downward revision, the pulses stock-to- use (STU) ratio has also fallen. Furthermore, deficient kharif sowing of (-) 4.9 per cent in tur, (-) 1.3 per cent in urad and (-) 6.0 per cent in moong (as on September 29, 2023) also added to price pressures (Chart II.13 and Chart II.14). To contain price pressures and improve domestic availability, the government (i) imposed stock limits on tur and urad on June 2, 2023, which will be effective till December 31, 2023; (ii) removed procurement ceilings of 40 per cent for tur, urad and Prices of animal-based protein increased sharply in H1:2023-24 (April-August), driven by milk r p A y a M g u A c e D r a M Amul raised retail prices by `2-3 per litre twice from February 2023, citing high input costs.

As part of price stabilisation measures, the government reduced the basic import duty on refined soyabean oil and refined sunflower oil from 17.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent (on June 15, 2023, effective till March 31, 2024) and exempted imports of crude soybean oil and crude sunflower oil from basic customs duty and agriculture infrastructure and development cess (AIDC) till June 30, 2023 for tariff rate quota (TRQ) holders to ensure domestic availability and affordable prices. Ghee and butter price inflation remained at elevated levels, reflecting the pass-through of higher milk prices. s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e p n n o i t u b i r t n o C 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - g u A Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI-animal protein group.

Inflation in prices of sugar and confectionery (weight of 1.4 per cent in the CPI and 3.0 per cent in the food and beverages group) increased gradually during April-August 2023, reflecting reduced production in 2022-23 season from the earlier estimate and the pickup in demand during summer months. cent in August; inflation in prices of dry chillies was also elevated averaging 24.2 per cent during April- August 2023. Inflation in prepared meals moderated gradually, reflecting the waning of the pass-through of past increases in input costs such as edible oils, LPG, and transport costs. Among other food items, inflation in prices of spices witnessed a sustained rise, averaging 19.9 per cent during April-August 2023 and driven mainly by jeera (cumin) and dry chillies due to subdued production for the second consecutive year in 2022-23 on account of poor weather conditions and crop substitution in major producing states. On a y-o-y basis, jeera recorded the highest increase in prices at 118.2 per Retail price margins \u2013 the difference of retail and wholesale prices9 \u2013 remained broadly unchanged for cereals. Pulses price margins underwent an increase during July-September 2023, driven by retail prices of tur, urad, moong and gram.

Data for January-March 2021 have been excluded due to changes in price collection mechanism and item varieties by DCA. oil) remained elevated and steady even as wholesale prices registered a downward movement. Margins in vegetables prices picked up significantly during June- August 2023, owing to the sharp increase in retail margins in tomatoes (Chart II.17). With an easing of tomato prices starting the third week of August 2023, retail margins for vegetables softened in September 2023. The sensitivity of margins to wholesale prices in the TOP group is the highest for tomatoes and the lowest for potatoes (Box II.1). Volatile movements in food items, especially vegetables, have brought increased focus on retail margins and their behaviour in the past few years (Jose et al. 2021, Bhoi et al. 2019). During January 2014-August 2023, margins10 were the highest for tomatoes, followed by onions and potatoes (Chart II.1.1a). Mapping TOP margins with the corresponding wholesale price levels, it is observed that as wholesale prices increase, margins also rise. During July 2014 to August 2023, when the TOP wholesale prices rose from the 10th to the 100th percentile of the distribution, margins increased by three times for tomatoes, and two times for onions, while the increase was low in case of potatoes. However, as a percentage of wholesale prices, margins were seen to fall. From the 10th to the 100th percentile, the margins in tomatoes fell from 39 per cent to 23 per cent, in onions from 37 per cent to 17 per cent, and in potatoes from 36 per cent to 22 per cent (Chart II.1.1b). The sensitivity of retail TOP margins to changes in wholesale prices can be assessed by regressing the TOP margins (expressed as ` per kg) on to their respective wholesale prices (bracketed into percentiles of the wholesale price distribution). For tomatoes, for each one rupee increase in wholesale prices in the lowest 10th percentile, margins increased by 30 paise; the increase was lower at 25 paise in the 50th percentile and 20 m a r g o l i k r e p ` s n i g r a M s n i g r a M 10 Margins have been computed as the difference between retail and wholesale prices.

For onions, the sensitivity of margins to changes in wholesale prices was lower and more stable \u2013 for each one rupee increase in the wholesale prices, retail margins increased by around 10-12 paise across percentiles. In the case of potatoes, the sensitivity of margins to wholesale prices remained largely insignificant within the 10th to 70th percentiles and became significant only when the wholesale prices reached the highest end of the percentile distribution (Table II.1.1). Overall, the analysis shows that margins are the highest and most sensitive to wholesale price variations in the case of tomatoes and least in the case of potatoes. The margin sensitivities to wholesale price changes taper along higher percentiles of wholesale prices and decline or at most remain stable, when expressed as a percentage of wholesale prices.

Kerosene prices remained in deflation during May- CPI fuel inflation moderated from 8.8 per cent in March 2023 to 3.7 per cent in July on account of softening of kerosene and domestic liquified petroleum gas (LPG) prices, before it rose to 4.3 per cent in August.

During June-August, the diffusion index rebounded, but threshold core DIs for saar of greater than 4 per cent and 6 per cent remained in contraction (Chart II.20). During 2023-24 (April-August), the contribution of transportation and communication and clothing and footwear sub-groups registered a significant softening (Chart II.21). CPI excluding food and effec Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in the respective sub-group. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. The movement of petrol and diesel prices into deflation during Q1:2023-24, along with a softening in transportation fares and communication services, led to the sharp moderation in transportation and communication inflation. A firming up of gold and silver prices kept personal care and effects inflation and its contribution to core inflation elevated (Chart II.22). A decomposition of CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold, and silver inflation into its goods (with a weight of 20.7 per cent in the headline CPI) and services (weight of 23.0 per cent) components shows a softening in both the categories, but mainly led by goods. While core goods inflation moderated by 190 bps from 7.3 per cent in February 2023 to 5.4 per cent in August, services core inflation fell by around 90 bps to 4.2 per cent. The key drivers of the softening in goods inflation were clothing and footwear, household goods and personal care and effects (excluding gold and silver) (Chart II.23a). In the case of services, transportation fares (bus/tram/ taxi fare, air fare) and communication services along with housing drove the moderation in inflation (Chart II.23b). Trimmed mean measures11 also indicate a tempering of underlying inflation pressures, with weighted median inflation registering a decline of 140 bps between February and August 2023 (Table II.2). 11 While exclusion-based measures drop a fixed set of volatile items (for example, food and fuel) in each period, trimmed measures exclude items located in the tails of the inflation distribution - items displaying changes more than the specified threshold in prices each month are excluded, and the items dropped differ from month to month. 5% trimmed 10% trimmed 25% trimmed (CPI-RL) as also for industrial workers (CPI-IW) exceeded CPI headline inflation during March-June 2023 across most major groups. During July-August 2023, CPI-AL, CPI-RL, and CPI-IW edged up on higher food prices, in line with headline CPI. Wholesale price index (WPI) inflation, which was on a downward trajectory since October 2022, spiralled down into deflation in April-August, partly offset by higher vegetable prices in July, and fuel prices in August. The deflation in WPI pulled down the deflators for gross value added (GVA) and gross domestic product (GDP) in Q1:2023-24 (Chart II.24a). Overall, WPI inflation remained far below headline CPI inflation during March-August 2023, driven down by the fuel group \u2013 CPI contains transport fuel (petrol and diesel) prices of which have remained flat since August 2022, whereas WPI contains in s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A addition to petrol and diesel, other fuels such as which were by and large in deep deflation tracking and higher domestic production.

Inflation in the price of WPI electricity \u2013 a key input in both industrial and farm inputs \u2013 declined sharply post April 2023 on account of a substantial decrease in coal prices coupled with favourable base effects. Nominal rural wage growth accelerated to 6.6 per cent in July 2023 from 5.7 per cent in March 2023, with both agricultural and non-agricultural wages rising by more than 6 per cent (Chart II.26). While the increase in agricultural wage growth was recorded primarily in ploughing, picking works, horticulture, watering and irrigation works, packaging, and plant protection works, that in non-agricultural wages were broad based across the rural sector. In the organised sector, staff cost growth (y-o-y) quickened in Q1:2023-24 in the manufacturing sector. In the services sector, staff cost growth (y-o-y) decelerated, notwithstanding positive momentum, due to a strong favourable base effect. The share of staff cost in the value of production rose in Q1 for both manufacturing and services sectors (Chart II.27).

As per the firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys12, the pace of salary outgoes for the manufacturing, infrastructure and services sectors is expected to moderate in Q3:2023-24. Both input cost pressures and selling prices are expected to moderate in Q3 for services and infrastructure sectors.

Going forward, the likely be shaped by the intensity of El Ni\u00f1o conditions, As per manufacturing firms polled for the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), the pace of increase in input prices which quickened for the third successive month in August 2023, significantly retreated in September due to reduction in aluminium and oil prices. Higher raw materials, labour costs and increased demand led to an increase in output prices in July-September albeit at a slower pace than in May-June 2023. For services sector, the pace of increase in input prices started to fall in August-September 2023 converging towards its long-run average which also led to easing in prices charged to a six-month low. The input- output price gap reversed for manufacturing sector in September 2023 while it narrowed for services sector. (Chart II.29). Pro-active supply side measures assume importance in mitigating the adverse impact of supply shocks in the short-run. Medium-term policies to encourage crop diversification, promote climate-resilient crops, improve storage conditions, facilitate value addition would make food prices more resilient to climate vagaries. Monetary policy would persevere in its efforts to maintain price stability, to progressively align inflation with the target rate, thereby securing 13 Based on the monthly Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. The survey polls a panel of business leaders primarily from the manufacturing sector about their inflation expectations in the short and medium term. Domestic economic activity held up well in H1:2023-24, underpinned by private consumption and investment activity. The sustained buoyancy in services, consumer and business optimism, government\u2019s continued thrust on capex, and healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates brighten the outlook. Geopolitical tensions, geoeconomic fragmentation, signs of a global economic slowdown and El Ni\u00f1o conditions pose risks. Underpinning the resilience of domestic economic activity in H1:2023-24, private consumption was driven by stable urban demand and a gradual revival in rural demand. Investment activity gained traction from sustained government capex. On the other hand, weak external demand restrained domestic activity.

Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) \u2013 the mainstay of aggregate demand \u2013 rose by 6.0 per cent in Q1:2023-24 and contributed 3.5 percentage points to overall GDP growth. Amongst the high frequency passenger traffic and passenger vehicle sales recorded consumer durables were subdued during April-July, dragged down by textiles, readymade garments, and cut and polished diamonds (Chart III.3c). Bank credit to households remained supportive of urban Rural demand showed incipient signs of recovery in H1 (Chart III.4). Tractor sales recovered during May- August, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.

Consumer non-durables h k a L r a M r p A y a M g u A c e D 2 2 - g u A and sales volume of major fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) improved in H1. Fertiliser sales recovered in July-August after a dip in Q1 with the progress of kharif sowing. s e n n o t h k a L r a M r p A y a M g u A c e D The labour force participation rate1 inched up to 40.9 per cent in September 2023 from 39.8 per cent in March (Chart III.5a). The unemployment rate increased to 8.9 per cent in September from 8.6 per cent in March in urban areas while in rural areas it moderated to 6.2 per cent from 7.8 per cent during this period. The Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) payrolls data point to an improvement in employment conditions in the organised sector during June-July (Chart III.5b). Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by 8.0 per cent in Q1:2023-24, driven up by the government\u2019s capex push and a modest uptick in private sector investment. The share of GFCF in GDP was 34.7 per cent in Q1, the same as a year ago. Amongst the key underlying indicators, imports of capital goods expanded during April-August, led by machinery, electrical and non-electrical goods and iron and steel (Chart III.6a). Railway locomotives, separators, bodies of trucks and buses supported the domestic production of capital goods (Chart III.6b). Coincident indicators of construction activity \u2013 steel consumption and cement production \u2013 posted strong growth in H1, bolstered by both residential spending and government\u2019s infrastructure push (Chart III.6c and d). Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector2 recorded a seasonal dip to 73.6 per cent in Q1:2023-24 from 76.3 per cent in Q4:2022-23, close to the long- term average of 73.7 per cent3. Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation improved to 75.4 per cent from 74.1 per cent (Chart III.7). Stretched capacity utilisation in manufacturing presages the need for new capacity additions to keep pace with the strength of underlying domestic demand in the economy.

Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) contracted by 0.7 per cent in Q1:2023-24, pulling down GDP growth. The central government\u2019s revenue expenditure excluding interest payments and subsidies grew by 13.1 per cent (y-o-y) during April- August 20235. The outgo on major subsidies surged by 32.5 per cent during April-August due to higher food and fertiliser subsidies. Capital expenditure expanded by 48.1 per cent (y-o-y) during April-August, driven by 35.3 per cent increase in capital outlay, led by railways sector (Chart III.9a). The revenue expenditure to capital outlay (RECO) ratio decreased to 4.1 in April- August from 4.9 a year ago, indicative of the ongoing qualitative in central government improvement expenditure (Chart III.9b). Chart III.10). GST collections (centre plus states) drew buoyancy from improving economic activity and compliance. Custom duty receipts surged - despite a contraction in merchandise exports and imports - on account of, inter alia, higher export and import duties for a few items. Union excise duties inched down, d n a s u o h t On the receipts side, the central government\u2019s gross tax revenues increased by 16.5 per cent y-o-y during April-August 2023, driven by a growth of 26.1 per cent in direct taxes. Indirect tax revenues expanded by 7.9 per cent y-o-y, aided by goods and services tax (GST) collections and custom duties (Table III.2 and 5 Growth was (-)7.3 per cent in Q1:2023-24 and 65.4 per cent in July-August 2023. The high July-August growth was partly due to base effect. Per cent to BE Note: BE: Budget Estimates.

Overall, net tax revenue of the central government increased by 14.8 per cent during April-August. central government\u2019s gross fiscal deficit (GFD) stood at 36.0 per cent of the full year\u2019s budget estimates (BE), higher than 32.6 per cent a year ago. The central government\u2019s non-tax revenues jumped by 79.4 per cent during April-August 2023 due to higher dividends and profits (Chart III.11). The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s dividend rose to `87,416 crore from `30,307 crore last year. During April-August, the Turning to state governments, their consolidated GFD is budgeted at 3.1 per cent of the GDP in 2023-24, i.e., within the 3.5 per cent limit stipulated by the central government. Growth in revenue receipts is budgeted to accelerate, led by tax revenue (Table III.3 and Chart III.12a). Capital spending is expected to rise by 40.3 per cent in 2023-24 on top of 18.5 per cent a year ago, boosted by the support of `1.3 lakh crore from the central government under the \u2018Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment\u2019. The revenue expenditure to capital outlay ratio is budgeted to fall to 5.0 in 2023-24 from 6.1 in 2022-23. Notes: A: Actuals; PA: Provisional Accounts; BE: Budget Estimates.

Amongst the key deficit indicators of the states/UTs, consolidated revenue deficit improved during April- July 2023, while gross fiscal deficit deteriorated due to front loading of capex during this period (Chart III.12b). Capital expenditure of the states increased by 49.8 per cent y-o-y during April-July, aided by an additional instalment of tax devolution from the central government and an approval of `84,884 crores (as on July 25, 2023) from the centre under the \u2018Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment\u2019. The Union Budget 2023-24 provided for gross and net market borrowings through dated securities at `15.43 lakh crore and `11.81 lakh crore, respectively. The centre\u2019s gross issuances of market borrowings through dated securities amounted to `8.88 lakh crore during H1 (57.6 per cent of the full year\u2019s budgeted amount) (Table III.4). The weighted average cost of issuances during H1 at 7.2 per cent was marginally lower than 7.3 per cent a year ago, while the weighted average maturity elongated to 17.6 years from 15.7 years. During H2, the Centre's gross market borrowings through dated securities have been planned for `6.55 lakh crore. States raised gross market borrowings of `3.58 lakh crore during H1 as against `4.37 lakh crore in the indicative calendar. During Q3:2023-24, indicative calendar has placed states gross market borrowings at `2.37 lakh crore. To meet the transitory mismatches between receipts and expenditure, the Ways and Means Advances (WMA) limit for the central government for H1 was `1.5 lakh crore, and it has been fixed at `50,000 crore for H2. For states/ union territories, the WMA limits remained at `47,010 crore as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advances to State Governments (Chairman: Shri Sudhir Shrivastava). India\u2019s external demand was weighed down by the slowing global economy, persisting geopolitical fragmentation. tensions, Merchandise exports and imports (US$ terms) have been in contraction territory since February 2023. Services trade exhibited slowdown during April-August amidst global headwinds. According to the NSO, exports of goods and services contracted by 7.7 per cent in real terms, while imports of goods and services grew by 10.1 per cent, resulting in a sharp jump in the drag from net exports to (-) 6.4 per cent of GDP in Q1:2023- 24 from (-) 0.1 per cent in Q4:2022-23 and (-) 2.3 per cent a year ago. 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A n o i l l i b $ S U rade b a Merchandise exports (US$ terms) fell by 11.9 per cent y-o-y during April-August 2023, and merchandise imports by 12.1 per cent.

In the case of imports, 17 major commodities, accounting for 55.4 per cent of the imports basket, registered contraction during April-August 2023, driven by petroleum and crude products, coal and chemicals. Electronic goods, machinery, electrical and non-electrical products and gold imports, on the other hand, expanded (Chart III.15). Non-oil non-gold imports fell by 9.0 per cent. account, net FDI inflows moderated to US$ 5.8 billion during April-July 2023 amidst a broader fall in global FDI flows (Chart III.17). Manufacturing, financial services, business services, and computer services were the major recipient sectors while Singapore, Japan, the Netherlands, the USA and Mauritius were the major source countries of inward FDI to India. Services exports were buoyed by software services, business and financial services and travel services in Q1:2023-24. Services exports growth moderated substantially to 6.8 per cent during April-August 2023 from 32.1 per cent a year ago, partly reflecting slowdown in key partner countries (Chart III.16). Services imports posted a muted growth of 0.9 per cent in Q1:2023-24, with decline in outgoes under transportation servces. Services imports declined by 1.5 per cent y-o-y in July-August 2023. On a balance of payments basis, the current account deficit narrowed to 1.1 per cent of GDP in Q1:2023-24 from 2.1 per cent of GDP in the corresponding period of the previous year on the back of lower merchandise trade deficit, higher net surplus in services exports and robust inward remittances.

Moderating global energy and non-energy prices supported value addition in both manufacturing and services sectors. Petroleum product prices have an asymmetric impact on activity: the positive impact of easing prices is lower than the negative impact of an equivalent increase in prices (Box III.1). Global energy prices have a sizeable impact on output and prices in countries heavily dependent on imports of energy. The impact of oil and other energy prices increases/decreases on output can be asymmetric (Rahman and Serlitis, 2010; Catik and Onder, 2013). Against this backdrop, the potential asymmetric impact of oil prices on aggregate gross value added (GVA) and manufacturing GVA is assessed by using a non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) modelling framework over the period Q1:2005-06 to Q1:2023-24. A linear model is also estimated for comparative analysis. The model includes the real weighted average lending rate (IR), the global index of industrial production (GIIP) as a control for global economic activity and wholesale price index (WPI) of diesel (OIL) (as a measure of domestic oil price). All variables, except the interest rate, are in log form in the long-run equation and in first differences in the short-run equation. Two models are estimated: (i) excluding GIIP (Model 1) and (ii) including GIIP (Model 2). The NARDL model takes the following form: overall GVA growth by around 33-36 bps and 24-39 bps, respectively, whereas an equivalent reduction of one per cent in diesel prices boosts manufacturing GVA and overall GVA growth by a lower magnitude of around 7-8 bps and 4-9 bps, respectively (Table III.1.1). In the linear model, a one per cent increase/decrease in oil prices where Y is the dependent variable (Aggregate GVA or Manufacturing GVA) and X are the explanatory variables (IR, GIIP, Oil+, Oil-). The bound tests confirms the presence of a long run cointegrating relationship. The model diagnostics are satisfactory and the coefficient of the error correction term in the short-run equations is negative, less than 1 and statistically significant. (H0: Coefficients are symmetric) The results indicate that an increase of one per cent in domestic diesel prices reduces manufacturing GVA and Note: Figures in parentheses are p-values. Source: RBI staff estimates. reduces/increases manufacturing GVA and overall GVA by a relatively modest 14 bps and 19 bps, respectively. The asymmetric impact could reflect incomplete pass-through by firms of higher input costs during the upswing phase of oil prices and the lower downward rigidity in output prices when oil prices correct. With oil prices remaining highly volatile, the adverse impact of any positive oil price shock is thus not fully offset by a similar degree of price correction. \u00c7at\u0131k, A and \u00d6nder, A.

The momentum of GVA was negative in Q1, reflecting the post-pandemic pattern (Chart III.18). Real GVA in agriculture, forestry and fishing posted a growth of 3.5 per cent in Q1:2023-24 (2.4 per cent a year ago). The south-west monsoon (June-September 2023) remained uneven in terms of spatial and temporal rainfall distribution. After a sluggish start in June, the monsoon gained strength in July but lost momentum in August and rainfall deficiency for the month at 36 per cent touched a new record. The monsoon, however, recovered in September, which helped to narrow the cumulative rainfall deficit to 6 per cent below the long period average (LPA) (6 per cent above LPA a year ago), with 29 out of the 36 sub-divisions receiving normal or above normal rainfall (Chart III.19a and b). The area under kharif sowing during 2023-24 swas marginally higher than last year. Amongst the major crops, area under rice was 1.9 per cent higher while acreage under pulses and oilseeds was lower by 4.2 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively (Chart III.19c). As of September 29, 2023, the reservoir levels stood at 73 per cent of the full capacity \u2014 below the last year\u2019s level of 89 per cent and the decadal average of 79 per cent (Chart III.19d). The production weighted rainfall (PRN) index was 93 as on September 30, 2023. The PRN for major crops was below normal except for cotton, pulses and oilseeds (Chart III.19e and f). The government announced an increase of 5.3-10.4 per cent in minimum support prices (MSP) for kharif crops, ensuring a return of at least 50 per cent over the cost of production (as measured by A2 plus FL7). The procurement of rice during the kharif marketing season 2022-23 ended at 570 lakh tonnes was 3.9 per cent lower than in the previous year. For wheat, on the 7 A2 (out of pocket expenses) plus FL (family labour) includes all paid out costs such as expenses on hired labour, machines, rent paid for leased land, seeds, fertilisers, irrigation charges, depreciation as well as imputed value of family labour. s e r a t c e h h k a L y t i c a p a c eAr a* ga ca Su r ne Note:*Normal area as on date is the average of 5 years - 2018-19 to 2022-23.

Industrial GVA expanded by 4.6 per cent in Q1:2023- 24 (7.3 per cent a year ago), driven by stronger manufacturing activity than a year ago, benefitting from easing input cost pressures and normalisation of supply chains (Chart III.21). The index of industrial production (IIP) posted a growth of 4.8 per cent y-o-y during April- July 2023 (9.2 per cent above the pre-pandemic level), supported by all its constituents \u2013 mining, manufacturing and electricity (Chart III.22 and Table III.6).

In terms of the use-based classification, the production of infrastructure and construction goods posted double digit growth, while that of consumer durables contracted. Electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services registered moderate growth, owing to lower household demand for electricity due to the relatively colder weather conditions during Q1. Electricity generation rose by 5.3 per cent y-o-y in April-August 2023 (10.6 per cent a year ago).

Region-wise, electricity demand remained strong in all regions except in the northern region. Demand in the northern region picked up in July-August (Chart III.23b). The manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) indicated improvement in overall business conditions. It rose to 57.9 in H1:2023-24 from 55.7 in Q4:2022-23, with pick up in domestic and export orders. The future output index also strengthened (Chart III.24a). ing Note: >50: Expansion, < 50: Contraction. Source: S&P Global. Services sector GVA recorded a robust growth of 10.0 per cent y-o-y in Q1:2023-24, exceeding the pre-pandemic level by 14.1.per cent. It was buoyed by sustained growth in contact-intensive services, financial services, real estate activities and revival in construction activity (Chart III.25a). Trade, hotels, transport, communication, and other services trailed the pre-pandemic level by 2.0 per cent. Residential housing demand and infrastructure spending by the government propelled a strengthening of construction activity. The traction in trade and transportation services continued in Q2, as reflected in high frequency indicators. GST collections and issuances of e-way bills \u2013 indicators of wholesale and retail trade \u2013 remained solid. Cement production and steel consumption reflected the improvement in construction activity traffic III.25b). Domestic air passenger (Chart expanded by 19.1 per cent in Q1 and by 24-26 per cent in July-August on the back of increased travel and business-related activities (Table III.7). High-speed diesel and toll collections point to a healthy growth in road transport in H1. Railway freight traffic and port cargo, after a muted growth of 1.1 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively, in Q1 made a smart recovery in Q2 especially in August. Real GVA growth in financial, real estate and professional services accelerated to 12.2 per cent in Q1:2023-24 from 8.5 per cent a year ago. Bank credit and deposits expanded by 15.3 per cent (y-o-y) and 12.3 per cent as on September 22, suggesting continued buoyancy in financial services. In the real estate sector, new launches and sales increased by 10.9 per cent and 8.4 per cent respectively on a y-o-y basis during Q1 and surpassed their pre-pandemic levels (Chart III.26a). According to the RBI\u2019s all-India housing price index, housing prices increased by 5.1 per cent y-o-y in Q1, the highest in 19 quarters, led by Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai (Chart III.26b). Public administration, defence and other services (PADO) posted a robust growth of 7.9 per cent y-o-y in Q1 (21.3 per cent in Q1 of last year) primarily due to healthy growth in services like education, health, Trade, hotels, transport, communica services related to broadcasting PMI: Services (>50 indicates growth over previous month) Construction Steel consumption Cement production Trade, Hotels, Transport, Communication and Services related to Broadcasting Commercial vehicle sales Domestic air passenger traffic Domestic air cargo International air cargo Railway freight traffic Port cargo Toll collection: volume Petroleum consumption 14 Credit outstanding Bank deposits 15 16 Life insurance premium 17 Non-life insurance premium recreation and cultural services, which offset the muted growth in government consumption. driven by demand and new business gains strengthened Domestic economic activity held up well in H1:2023- demand. Private consumption improved across urban, and rural constituents. Investment activity drew strength mainly from government capex. Looking and business optimism, government\u2019s continued thrust on capex, healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates, and supply chain normalisation should support economic activity. Geopolitical tensions and geoeconomic fragmentation, volatility in global financial markets and energy prices, global economic slowdown and El Ni\u00f1o conditions pose risks to the domestic outlook. Domestic financial markets exhibited orderly movements and were range-bound during H1:2023-24. Bank lending and deposit rates increased, but the pass-through of the past rate hikes is still incomplete. Bank credit growth remained strong. Going forward, the Reserve Bank will conduct market operations to ensure financial stability while providing liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy. During H1:2023-24, global financial markets were volatile, reflecting heightened uncertainty around the trajectory of monetary policy. Sovereign bond yields firmed up with core inflation remaining sticky, tight labour markets and disinflationary resolve in monetary policy stances. Global equity markets gained during April-July 2023 on optimism about an early end to the tightening cycle, but they corrected subsequently on expectations of policy rates staying higher for longer. The US dollar remained volatile as it fell to a 15-month low in mid-July but recouped its losses subsequently. Swings in capital flows and tight global financial conditions posed challenges to macroeconomic and financial stability in emerging market economies (EMEs). Domestic financial markets exhibited orderly movements. Money market rates were largely range bound while government bond yields eased from end-March 2023. The risk premium on corporate bonds moderated, equity market exhibited buoyancy and the INR underwent two-way movements. The transmission of cumulative policy rate changes led to a sustained firming up of bank deposit and lending rates. Growth in bank credit was robust, outpacing deposit expansion. During H1:2023-24, money market rates oscillated within the policy corridor in tune with evolving liquidity conditions and market operations of the Reserve Bank (Chart IV.1a). On an average basis, the weighted average call money rate (WACR), the operating target of monetary policy, was 5 bps above the repo rate (Chart IV.1b). the share of reported deals in the total call money market volume declined sharply from 33 per cent in September 2022 to less than 1 per cent in September 2023. Other overnight money market rates viz., triparty repo (TREPS) and market repo moved in tandem with the WACR, which intermittently firmed up above the MSF rate \u2013 the ceiling of the LAF corridor \u2013 in August and September due to frictional liquidity tightness caused by advance tax payments, goods and services tax (GST) outflows and the incremental CRR (I-CRR) prescribed for all scheduled banks in August 2023. In the overnight call money segment, the weighted average rate (WAR) of traded deals1 was 5 bps above the policy repo rate (on an average basis) while that of reported deals was 13 bps below during H1:2023- 24 (Chart IV.2a). The average monthly volume of traded deals (`2.1 lakh crore) dominated the reported segment (`0.1 lakh crore) due to the Reserve Bank\u2019s (including to all eligible participants directive cooperative banks) to obtain NDS-CALL membership as well as the restoration of regular market hours in the call money market (Chart IV.2b). Consequently, Money market activity remained dominated by the collateralised segments, with the share of the uncollateralised call money market unchanged at 2.0 per cent in H1. The share of TREPS moderated to 64 per cent in H1 from 70 per cent in H2:2022-23, with a corresponding increase in the share of market repo to 34 per cent from 27 per cent (Chart IV.3). Among investors, mutual funds (MFs) remained the major lenders in the triparty repo segment (64 per cent share in H1 as compared with 67 per cent in H2:2022-23) as well as in the market repo segment (unchanged at 40 per cent). On the borrowing side, the share of public sector banks (PSBs) in TREPS and market repo declined to 50 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, in H1 from 61 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively, in H2:2022-23. Among money market instruments, the yield on 3-month T-bills (TBs) was broadly aligned with the \u2018Traded deals\u2019 are negotiated directly on the NDS-Call platform whereas \u2018reported deals\u2019 are over-the-counter (OTC) deals which are reported on the MSF rate in H1 while that on commercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposit (CDs) ruled above the MSF rate (Chart IV.4). The spreads of TBs, CDs and CPs over the policy repo rate narrowed to 27 bps, 50 bps and 66 bps, respectively, in H1:2023-24 from 30 bps, 85 bps and 99 bps, respectively, in H2:2022-23. crore in H2:2022-23 as deposit growth accelerated.

Corporates remained the major issuers of the MPC\u2019s decision to pause, lower than expected domestic CPI inflation for March-April and softening US yields. In June, yields hardened taking cues from rise in US yields. Overall, the 10-year benchmark yield fell by 21 bps in Q1 to close at 7.10 per cent. In Q2, yields firmed up in July on the back of hardening US yields and crude oil prices but remained steady Outstanding (as at end-period) yields rose by 12 bps to 7.22 per cent in Q2. Yields on T-bills softened across tenors between Among various maturity buckets, the 31-90 days segment had the largest share in fresh CP issuances [45 per cent in H1 as against 49 per cent in H2:2022- 23] (Table IV.1). expectations remaining anchored on unchanged The trading volume in G-secs and T-bills increased in IV.1.2 Government Securities (G-sec) Market During H1:2023-24, the 10-year G-sec yield softened by 9 bps reflecting domestic as well as global factors (Chart IV.6). Yields eased in April-May 2023 due to G-secs declined by 20 bps while it increased by 15 bps The overall dynamics of the yield curve are captured by its level, slope, and curvature2. During H1, the average level of yields softened by 2 bps while, the slope steepened by 8 bps. The curvature rose by 2 bps as yields in the mid-segment of the curve increased more than in the short and long segments (Chart IV.9). In the Indian context, the level and curvature of the yield curve are found to have more future macroeconomic information content on outcomes than the slope, unlike in AEs.3 The level is the average of par yields of all tenors up to 30-years published by FBIL and the slope (term spread) is the difference in par yields of 3-months and 30-year maturities. The curvature is calculated as twice the 14-year yield minus the sum of 30-year and 3-month yields. 3 Patra, M.D., Joice, J., Kushwaha, K.M., and I. Bhattacharyya (2022), \u201cWhat is the Yield Curve telling us about the Economy?\u201d, Reserve Bank of India Bulletin, June. To facilitate debt consolidation, the Reserve Bank conducted six switch auctions on behalf of the Central Government amounting to `51,597 crore during H1. The weighted average maturity (WAM) of the outstanding stock of G-secs rose to 12.22 years at end- September 2023 from 11.94 years at end-March 2023. The weighted average coupon (WAC) at 7.28 per cent at end-September 2023 was marginally higher than 7.26 per cent as at end-March 2023. s t n i o p s i s a B The weighted average spread of cut-off yields on state government securities (SGS) over the G-sec yields of comparable maturities was 24 bps in H1 (Chart IV.10). The average inter-state spread on securities of 10-year tenor (fresh issuances) was 1 bp in H1:2023-24 as against 4 bps in H2:2022-23. Corporate bond yields softened and spreads narrowed during H1:2023-24, mirroring G-sec yields. The average yield on AAA-rated 3-year bonds issued by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and corporates declined by 29 bps (to 7.83 per cent) and 24 bps (to 7.83 per cent), respectively, in September over March 2023. The average yield on issuances by public sector undertakings (PSUs), financial institutions (FIs) and banks softened by 10 bps to 7.65 per cent (Chart IV.11a). The risk premium (the spread over 3-year G-sec yields) moderated from 73 bps to 51 bps for NBFCs, from 68 bps to 51 bps for corporates and from 36 bps to 33 bps for PSUs, FIs and banks (Chart IV.11b). Note: Data for spreads are monthly averages. Source: Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA). The reduction in risk premia was seen across tenors and the rating spectrum (Table IV.2). The average 3-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the State Bank of India\u2019s paper trading overseas reduced by 26 bps while that of ICICI Bank moderated by 25 bps in H1:2023-24 over H2:2022-23. Spread (bps) (over corresponding risk-free rate) Primary issuances of corporate bonds rose during H1 (up to August 2023) to `3.4 lakh crore \u2013 substantially higher than `1.9 lakh crore during the corresponding period of 2022-23 \u2013 due to stable long term yields and cost advantage vis-a-vis bank loans (Chart IV.12a). Overseas issuances, however, remained muted. Almost the entire resource mobilisation in the corporate bond market (97.6 per cent) was through the private placement route (up to August 2023). Outstanding investments by foreign portfolio in corporate bonds decreased investors Note: Yields and spreads are computed as monthly averages.

Secondary market activity exhibited strong momentum, with daily average trading volume during H1 (up to August 2023) at `5,958 crore \u2013 19.3 per cent higher than `4,994 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart IV.12c). Domestic equity markets remained buoyant in H1:2023-24 due to strong buying support from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), positive Q1 corporate earnings and a stable domestic economic outlook. From late July, however, markets reversed some of the earlier gains amidst weak global cues following the US sovereign rating downgrade and hawkish Fed monetary policy messages. The markets resumed upward momentum in September amidst optimism over moderating domestic inflation and positive industrial production data with the benchmark BSE Sensex closing at an all-time high of 67,839 on September 15, 2023. Thereafter, the US Fed's hawkish interest rate projections prompted some correction in equity prices. Overall, the BSE Sensex gained 11.6 per cent during H1 to close at 65,828. Equity market volatility was low, with the India VIX \u2013 which captures the short-term expected volatility of Nifty 50 \u2013 averaging 11.6 during H1 as compared with 15.1 in H2:2022-23 (Chart IV.13a). The Indian equity markets outperformed most EMEs and advanced economies (AEs) in H1 (Chart IV.13b). The 12-month trailing price-earnings ratio for the BSE Sensex at 23.0 as at end-September 2023 was around its 10-year average. Broader market indices outperformed the benchmark Sensex with the BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap indices rising by 34.4 per cent and 39.3 per cent, respectively, during H1:2023-24. Foreign investors remained net buyers in equities in H1, with the flows touching a 10-month high in June 2023. In contrast, flows from domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were muted. Net purchases by DIIs and FPIs amounted to `0.39 lakh crore and `1.41 lakh crore, respectively in H1:2023-24 (Chart IV.14a). Despite an increase in the number of primary issuances, resource mobilisation in equity market declined to `0.51 lakh crore during H1 (up to August 2023) from `0.91 lakh The Indian rupee largely remained range-bound in H1:2023-24 (Chart IV.15a). It traded with an appreciating bias during April-July 2023, mainly on the back of stable macroeconomic fundamentals and revival in FPI flows. From August, the INR exhibited a depreciation bias, with the US dollar strengthening on the back of expectations about the US policy rate remaining higher for longer. The INR volatility \u2013 e g a t n e c r e P a n i t n e g r A d n a l i a h T a c i r f A i p p i l i l i z a r B o c i x e M measured by the 1-month at the money (ATM) option implied volatility4 \u2013 exhibited a declining tendency, averaging 3.6 per cent during H1, down from 5.3 per cent during H2:2022-23 (Chart IV.15b). Bank credit6 growth remained strong in H1:2023-24 in tandem with economic activity. Non-food bank credit extended by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose by 15.3 per cent (y-o-y) as on September 22, 2023 over and above a growth of 16.9 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.18). Between end-March and end-September 2023, the INR depreciated by 1.0 per cent against the US dollar although it outperformed many EME currencies like the Argentina Peso, the Turkish Lira, the Russian Ruble, the Thai Baht and the Malaysian Ringgit (Chart IV.16). In terms of the 40-currency real effective exchange rate, the INR appreciated by 5.4 per cent between March and end-September 2023 (Table IV.3). Forward premia eased across tenors during H1:2023- 24, driven by narrowing interest rate differentials. The 1-month forward premia declined to an average of 1.42 per cent in H1 from 2.38 per cent during H2:2022- 23 while the 12-month premia fell to 1.87 per cent from 2.25 per cent over the same period (Chart IV.17). Implied volatility is derived from an option\u2019s price and depicts the markets\u2019 expectations about the future volatility of the currency. 5 While overall bank credit and non-food credit data are based on Section-42 return (which covers all SCBs), sectoral non-food credit data are based on sector-wise and industry-wise bank credit (SIBC) return, which covers select banks accounting for about 93 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all SCBs. 6 Data on banking and select monetary aggregates exclude the impact of merger of a bank with a non-bank. \u00e0-vis PSBs (14.4 per cent) (Chart IV.19a). PSBs were, however, the major driver of incremental bank credit (Chart IV.19b). Sector-wise, services and personal loans were the key avenues of bank credit deployment and their share in total incremental credit offtake rose in H1:2023-24 vis- \u00e0-vis the same period of the previous year. Personal loans and services credit contributed 37.7 per cent and 36.9 per cent, respectively, of incremental bank credit (y-o-y) in August 2023 (Chart IV.20). Credit growth remained higher for private sector banks (PVBs) (18.1 per cent as on September 22) vis- Bank lending to agriculture sector remained buoyant, with a growth of 16.6 per cent (y-o-y) in August 2023. Credit growth to industry decelerated to 6.1 per cent in August 2023, with flows to MSMEs (10.1 per cent) exceeding those to large industries (4.8 per cent). All the major industries, barring textiles and basic metals, experienced a slowdown in credit growth relative to August 2022. Credit growth to the infrastructure Private banks (including s 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - g u A sector weakened, mainly due to decline in credit to the power and telecom sectors (Chart IV.21). Services sector credit expanded by 20.7 per cent (y-o-y) in August, led by NBFCs. Within services, credit growth 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - r p A 2 2 - g u A 3 2 - r p A 3 2 - g u A b: Bank Credit to NBFCs to commercial real estate and transport operators also improved (Chart IV.22). Retail loans rose by 18.3 per cent (y-o-y) in August and remained the prime contributor of overall credit growth. Credit to the housing sector recorded consistent double-digit expansion (13.8 per cent in August) while vehicle loan growth strengthened to 20.6 per cent. Credit card loans maintained high growth (30.0 per cent in August) reflecting inter alia the buoyancy in demand from contact-intensive services (Chart IV.23). The composition of bank credit has witnessed substantial change over time, with an increasing proportion of credit now going to services and retail loans relative to industry (Chart IV.24). Amidst these structural changes, the impact of bank credit on GDP growth appears to have strengthened (Box IV.1). In a bank-based economy like India, bank credit serves as an in sustaining the growth momentum and is a key conduit for monetary policy transmission (Samargandi and Kutan, 2016). Impulse responses from a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model \u2013 including the following variables: GDP growth; CPI inflation; weighted average call rate; real non-food credit growth; and bank capital growth \u2013 for the period 2000-2023 and for the sub-period 2008-2023 indicate that: (i) credit shocks appear to have turned less persistent in the latter period (i.e., 2008-2023); (ii) bank credit continues to have a positive effect on growth and its impact has somewhat strengthened over time; and (iii) the effect of a monetary policy (interest rate) shock has become more pronounced, albeit less persistent (Chart IV.I.1). Note: The grey areas represent two-third of the identified posterior distribution. x-axis is horizon (quarters ahead) and y-axis is percentage points. Sources: RBI staff estimates. A historical decomposition based on the SVAR indicates that the drag from the contraction in real credit on GDP growth is fast diminishing and the recent positive trajectory of real bank credit should provide tailwinds to domestic demand in the ensuing quarters (Chart IV.I.2). Note: Shocks are defined as follows: AD shock increases output, inflation and credit; AS shock increases inflation but decreases GDP and credit; MP shock increases WACR but decreases inflation, GDP and credit; NFC shock captures exogenous increase in credit; DC shock moves GDP and credit in opposite direction and hence captures the decoupling between the two.

The asset quality of SCBs improved during H1:2023- 24, with the overall non-performing assets (NPA) ratio declining to 3.7 per cent in June 2023 from 5.7 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.25a). Asset quality improved across all the major sectors over the same period (Chart IV.25b). Amidst sustained growth in bank credit, banks\u2019 non-SLR investments (i.e., investments in CPs, and bonds, debentures and shares of public and private corporates) declined in H1:2023-24 as against an increase in H1:2022-23. The growth in adjusted non-food credit (i.e., non-food bank credit plus non-SLR investments) moderated to 14.4 per cent (y-o-y) as on September 22, 2023 from 15.1 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart IV.26b). 2023 as compared with 8.7 per cent at end-March 2023 (Chart IV.27). Excess SLR holdings provide collateral buffers to banks for availing funds under the LAF and from collateralised markets. They are also a component of the liquidity coverage ratio. The excess holdings of statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) securities by banks was 8.8 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as on August 25, Bank lending and deposit rates rose further in H1:2023-24, reflecting the lagged impact of the policy rate hikes during May 2022-February 2023, the external benchmark-based lending rate (EBLR) system of loans pricing and the moderation of surplus liquidity. In response to the 250 bps increase in the policy repo rate since May 2022, the weighted average lending rates (WALRs) on fresh and outstanding rupee loans increased by 196 bps and 112 bps, respectively, during May 2022-August 2023. On the deposit side, the weighted average domestic term deposit rates (WADTDRs) on fresh and outstanding term deposits rose by 233 bps and 157 bps, respectively, over the same period. The transmission to outstanding term deposits during H1:2023-24 (up to August) at 44 bps outpaced transmission on the lending side (12 bps), with the repricing of an increasing proportion of term deposits at higher rates (Table IV.4). EBLR loans now dominate the floating rate loans. Their share increased from 44.0 per cent in March 2022 to 50.2 per cent in June 2023, while that of MCLR-linked loans declined from 48.6 per cent to 44.8 per cent during the same period (Chart IV.28). The increasing share of EBLR-linked loans with shorter reset periods and the increase in the MCLRs aided transmission to WALR on outstanding loans of SCBs. Bank-group wise, the proportion of EBLR- linked loans was the highest in the case of foreign banks (87.6 per cent), followed by PVBs (73.2 per cent) and PSBs (36.1 per cent). The transmission to WALR on fresh rupee loans during May 2022 to August 2023 was higher in the case of PSBs relative to PVBs, while transmission to lending rates on outstanding rupee loans was higher for PVBs (Chart IV.29a). The lending rates of PVBs remained above those of PSBs (Chart IV.29b). The maximum transmission to lending and deposit rates was in the Notes: 1. \u2018Others\u2019 include base rate, benchmark prime lending rate and other case of foreign banks, reflecting a higher share of low- cost and lower duration wholesale deposits in their total liabilities and a high share of EBLR-linked loans. s t n i o p s i s a B Sector-wise, the WALR on fresh rupee loans rose by 213 bps for large industry, 128 bps for MSMEs and 113 bps for housing loans (Chart IV.30a). For floating rate loans mandatorily linked to EBLR, the WALR on fresh loans rose by 173 bps for MSMEs loans, by 159 bps for vehicle loans, and by 127 bps for housing loans (Chart IV.30b). i o p s i s a B i o p s i s a B g n i s u o H e l c i h e V s n a o L l a n o s r e P r e h t O rupee l n o i t a c u d E e r u t l u c i r g A ) e g r a L ( e r u t c u r t s a r f n I e d a r T s e c i v r e S l a n o i s s e f o r P t i d e r C t r o p x E e e p u R l l a r e v O Pri a The WADTDR on fresh term deposits declined during H1:2023-24 while that on outstanding deposits rose with an increasing proportion of deposits getting renewed at higher deposit rates. Across bank groups, the transmission to WADTDR on fresh deposits was higher for PSBs as compared with PVBs. Across tenors, the maximum increase was observed for shorter maturities (up to 180 days) (Chart IV.31). In the case of repo rate-linked loans, the spreads of WALR (fresh loans) over the policy repo rate narrowed, thereby moderating the transmission to actual lending rates on new loans (Table IV.5). While the increase in term deposit rates in the current tightening cycle has exceeded that in lending rates (both in terms of fresh and outstanding deposits/ loans), the savings deposit rates of banks \u2013 which are a third of total deposits \u2013 have remained almost unchanged, while current account balances (share of 9.6 per cent in total deposits) earn no interest. This has moderated the increase in the banks\u2019 overall cost of funds and is mirrored in higher net interest margins (Chart IV.32). i o p s i s a B Pri a k an s n o i s s i e v i t a l u m u C i o p s i s a b ( ing n o i s s i m s n a r t e v i t a l u m u C i o p s i s a b ( ing s an ) The Government of India (GOI) raised the interest rates on small savings instruments (SSIs), which are linked to secondary market yields on G-secs of comparable maturities, by 40-150 bps in five successive quarters beginning Q3:2022-23 (Chart IV.33). With these revisions, the actual interest rates on most SSIs are now better aligned with the formula-based rates (Table IV.6). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934 requires the RBI to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time, if any, in the public domain. During H1:2023-24, the monetary policy committee (MPC) kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent and continued with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation (see Chapter I).

It was indicated that the I-CRR would be reviewed on or before September 8, 2023 with a view to return the impounded funds to the banking system ahead of the festival season. On a review on September 8, the I-CRR was discontinued in a phased manner so that system liquidity is not subjected to sudden shocks and money markets function in an orderly manner: 25 per cent of the impounded I-CRR funds was released on September 9 and another 25 per cent on September 23 and the remaining 50 per cent are to be released on October 7. During H1, impacted substantially by the return of currency to the banking system following the Reserve Bank\u2019s decision on May 19 to withdraw `2,000 banknotes from circulation. In Q1, surplus liquidity shrank between April and mid-May with the seasonal expansion in currency in circulation (CiC) and the build-up of government cash balances. Between the third week of May and up to mid-June, liquidity conditions improved due to the (i) the return of `2,000 banknotes from circulation (Chart IV.34), (ii) an accelerated pace of Government spending before the onset of the monsoon season; and (iii) the Reserve Bank\u2019s market operations. Advance tax payments and GST related outflows moderated surplus liquidity in the second half of June 2023. In liquidity conditions were 7 The existing cash reserve ratio (CRR), however, remained unchanged at 4.5 per cent. s n o i t a i r a V y l k e e W balances due to advance tax collections and GST payments tightened liquidity conditions, particularly in the second half of September. Overall, net average absorption under the LAF at `1.1 lakh crore in H1 was higher than `0.4 lakh crore in H2:2022-23. Of the average total absorption of about `1.6 lakh crore in H1, `1.1 lakh crore (about 72 per cent) was through the standing deposit facility (SDF) while the remaining was mopped up through variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) operations \u2013 both main and fine-tuning \u2013 of various tenors. Q2, liquidity surplus rose amidst the continued return of `2,000 banknotes, with the net average absorption under the LAF increasing from `0.8 lakh crore in May 2023 to `1.6 lakh crore in July. With the I-CRR coming into effect from August 12, system liquidity, although somewhat moderating, remained in surplus barring a few days. Thereafter, build-up of government cash Overall, the build-up of government cash balances moderated surplus liquidity in H1 which was largely replenished by the return of currency to the banking system and the RBI\u2019s market operations (Table IV.7). In terms of liquidity management, absorptions under the LAF and increase in reserve requirements (through I-CRR) were the main instruments for mopping up the liquidity surplus. Borrowings under the MSF averaged `29,287 crore in H1, higher than `8,438 crore in H2:2022-23, peaking at `1.99 lakh crore on September 21. Net LAF (inclusive of MSF) slipped into deficit (injection (iii) GoI Cash Balances [build-up (-) / drawdown (+)] (iii) Excess Reserves [build-up (-) / drawdown (+)] (ii) Required Reserves [including both change in NDTL and I-CRR] (iii) Outstanding Net LAF as at the end of period [absorption (+)/injection (-)] e r o r c h k a l mode) on August 21 for the first time in 2023-24 and remained so till August 23; therafter, it again turned into deficit mode from the second half of September. On a monthly basis, net LAF slipped into deficit in September 2023 - the first time since May 2019 - with an average daily net injection of `0.15 lakh crore. At the overall level, the deployment of large surplus funds under the SDF and simultaneous recourse to the MSF was symptomatic of skewed liquidity distribution within the banking system (Chart IV.35). The frictional liquidity conditions led to the WACR breaching the MSF rate on 18 occassions in H1:2023- 24 \u2013 six in May; three in June; five in August; and four in September with the average spread (over the MSF) on these days at 3 bps. improvement in liquidity conditions, a 14-day variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auction (main operation) of `2.0 lakh crore was conducted on June 2 to absorb liquidity, followed by five fine tuning operations during June 5-13 of varying sizes \u2013 between `0.50 lakh crore to `1.0 lakh crore \u2013 with maturities between 2-4 days. To alleviate the liquidity stress caused by advance tax payments and GST outflows in the second half of June, a VRR fine tuning operation was conducted on June 19 injecting `75,004 crore into the banking system. With increased aversion among banks to park surplus funds for longer tenors, the Reserve Bank conducted six-fine tuning VRRR operations of 1-4 days maturity in July of size `1.0-2.0 lakh crore. Overall, 12 VRRR main operations and 11 VRRR fine tuning operations along with one VRR main operation and one VRR fine tuning operation were conducted in H1. The fine-tuning operations, on average, elicited better response from banks relative to the fortnightly 14-day main operations, with average bid-cover ratios of 0.46 and 0.35, respectively, in H1 (Chart IV.36). Banks need to hone their liquidity forecasting skills to efficiently assess liquidity requirements over the reserve maintenance cycle and bid accordingly in the main operation auctions, since fine tuning operations are neither a substitute of the main operation nor are they standing facilities \u2013 they are conducted at the discretion of the central bank as per operational requirements. During H1:2023-24, the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity management involved two-way operations. To assuage the liquidity tightness in the middle of May, a 14-day variable rate repo (VRR) auction (main operation) was conducted to inject liquidity amounting to `50,000 crore on May 19, 2023. Subsequently, however, with an Reserve money (RM) expanded by 6.4 per cent (y-o-y) as on September 29, 2023 as compared with 12.9 per cent a year ago (5.0 per cent adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the CRR as against 10.3 per cent a year ago).

Going forward, the Reserve Bank will remain agile and nimble in conducting market operations to ensure financial stability financial market conditions evolved in H1:2023-24. Market while providing liquidity to meet the productive The global economy is slowing. Headline inflation remains above target in major economies, prompting central banks to persist with monetary tightening. Uncertainty about the monetary policy trajectory is imparting volatility to global financial markets. Stubborn core inflation, tightening financial conditions, high public debt, geopolitical tensions, geoeconomic fragmentation and extreme weather events pose downside risks to the global growth outlook. The global economy is slowing, with divergent growth trajectories across countries and sectors. Headline inflation is easing unevenly but it remains above targets in major economies, while core inflation (headline excluding food and energy) remains elevated. Major central banks have accordingly persisted with monetary tightening during April-September, albeit with some moderation in the pace. Financial markets remain unsettled, anticipating \u2018higher for longer\u2019 stances in the future conduct of monetary policy. Sovereign bond yields have firmed up while the US dollar is exhibiting sharp two-way movements since the April 2023 MPR. Global equity markets gained during April-July 2023 on optimism about an early end to monetary tightening but have corrected recently on expectations of more monetary policy actions. Risks to global growth prospects are tilted to the downside. of 2.8 per cent, with the projection for 2024 retained at 3.0 per cent. The global growth in 2023-2024 is expected to be sizeably below the 2022 outturn (3.5 per cent) and the historical average (2000 to 2019) of 3.8 per cent1. Amongst the advanced economies (AEs), the US economy grew by 2.1 per cent (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualised rates (q-o-q, saar)) in Q2:2023, similar to its Q1 outturn (2.2 per cent) (Table V.1). This growth was driven by non-residential fixed investment, consumer spending, and government spending, though exports and residential fixed investment contracted. Tightness in the labour market persisted, with the unemployment rate at 3.8 per cent in August. The US composite S&P global purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI2) at 50.2 in September 2023 signalled its weakest performance since February 2023. Global growth appears to have lost pace in the third quarter of 2023, dragged down by tight financial conditions, high inflation weighing on consumer spending, slowdown the Chinese economy and renewed geopolitical hostilities. Lacklustre manufacturing and trade is holding back the revival, offsetting relatively robust services expansion. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) update of July 2023 revised up the global growth projection for 2023 by 20 basis points (bps) to 3.0 per cent from its April projection In the euro area, real GDP growth remained subdued at 0.5 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q2 (0.2 per cent in Q1) due to flat household consumption demand and contraction in exports. Services exhibited resilience, benefitting from strong demand for tourism and activities. The Eurozone other composite PMI remained in contraction for the fourth consecutive month at 47.2 in September due to deteriorating demand and a sharp drop in new orders. The unemployment rate was 6.4 per cent in August 2023, broadly comparable with 6.5 per cent in March. 1 The OECD in its Interim Economic Outlook (September 2023) revised up global growth forecast for 2023 to 3.0 per cent and revised it down to 2.7 per cent for 2024 from June 2023 projections of 2.7 per cent and 2.9 per cent, respectively. 2 The references to PMIs are to S&P Global indices, unless specified otherwise. Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted, annualised rate (q-o-q, saar) since late-2021. The UK composite PMI at 48.5 in September was the weakest since January 2023 and signalled a reduction in private sector output amidst weak manufacturing activity. Japan\u2019s GDP growth accelerated from 3.2 per cent in Q1:2023 (q-o-q, saar) to 4.8 per cent in Q2, led by car exports and inbound tourism benefiting from a weaker yen. The composite PMI (au Jibun Bank) remains in expansion since the beginning of 2023, though it declined from 52.9 in April 2023 to 52.1 in September. Amongst emerging market economies (EMEs), China\u2019s real GDP moderated to 3.2 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q2 from 9.1 per cent in Q1. The upturn in economic activity following the reopening of the economy waned amidst weakened consumer spending, lower exports and the beleaguered real estate sector. The composite PMI (Caixin) slowed to a 9-month low at 50.9 in September, as both manufacturing and services PMIs moderated despite remaining in expansionary territory, with the latter falling more sharply. Chinese economy is projected by the IMF to grow by 5.2 per cent in 2023 and 4.5 per cent in 2024 (Table V.2). China undertook monetary easing and provided regulatory relaxation for its real estate sector to stimulate the economy. P: Projection.

The UK\u2019s GDP grew by 0.8 per cent in Q2:2023 (q-o-q, saar) (1.3 per cent in Q1), supported by the extension of an energy price guarantee by the government to ease the cost of living, as well as fall in energy and commodity prices. The labour market remains tight, notwithstanding an increase in the unemployment rate to 4.3 per cent in May-July 2023, the highest Amongst other major EMEs, Brazil\u2019s GDP growth decelerated from 4.0 per cent (y-o-y) in Q1:2023 to 3.4 per cent in Q2. The labour market remained resilient albeit with some moderation. The composite PMI fell to a 29-month low of 49.0 in September from 50.6 in August amid contraction in both manufacturing and services sectors. The South African economy grew by 1.6 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2023 from 0.2 per cent in the previous quarter, with a rise in investment demand and government expenditure. The composite PMI for South Africa fell to 49.9 in September, indicating stagnation after expanding for the first time in six months in August.

In its July 2023 WEO update, the IMF projected world trade (goods and services) growth to decelerate from 5.2 per cent in 2022 to 2.0 per cent in 2023. Reflecting the subdued global trade outlook, the Baltic Dry Index (BDI), a benchmark of shipping costs of dry bulk, trailed its 2022 average (Chart V.2b). Global commodity prices declined by 4.2 per cent (q-o-q) index before rising from July 2023 onwards on higher deal (Chart 3a). Global food prices, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), eased by 3.2 per cent (q-o-q) in Q2:2023 and a further 1.7 per cent in Q3 (up to August), primarily driven by a correction in the prices of cereals and dairy products. Meat and sugar prices, which had hardened in Q2, softened in Q3, while vegetable oil prices reversed the easing in Q2 and rose in Q3 (Chart V.3b). to the World Bank, natural gas prices softened by 28.4 per cent in Q2 because of high inventories as heating demand declined owing to a mild winter. The softening continued till July before prospects of a strike at a liquefied natural gas producer in Australia intensified fears of disruption to global supplies in August. Overall, natural gas prices edged up by 2.2 per cent in Q3 (Chart V.3c). Crude oil prices have firmed up since the last MPR. They initially softened during Q2, largely reflecting weak global economic demand (Chart V.3c). Crude oil prices rose sharply in Q3 in response to cuts in oil supplies by Saudi Arabia and Russia that were extended through the rest of 2023. Brent crude prices crossed US$ 90 per barrel in September, touching their highest level since November 2022. According Base metal prices have generally remained stable since April 2023 in view of weak economic activity in China and sustained monetary tightening worldwide. Gold price rebounded in the first half of Q2 on safe haven demand amidst bank failures in the US and Europe. It fell in June as central banks\u2019 purchases slowed down and retail demand for gold moderated. Gold price declined further in August as the US dollar strengthened. In September, most base metals prices hardened on Chinese stimulus measures to support the housing market through relaxation in requirements for mortgage down payments and interest rates (Chart V.3d). of moderation is tardy (Box V.1). Core goods inflation eased as demand and supply for consumer goods moved into better balance. Services price inflation remains strong, contributing to wage pressures. According to the IMF\u2019s WEO July 2023 update, global inflation is projected to moderate from an annual Consumer price is easing, reflecting softening energy and food prices, improving supply chains and tighter monetary policy. It is, however, ruling well above targets, especially in AEs (Table V.3). Core inflation is relatively sticky, and the pace In the US, headline CPI inflation decelerated from 5.0 P: Projection.

(2) Figures in the parentheses for US are year-on-year change in personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index. The combination of the surge in demand fuelled by unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus and sustained supply distortions and commodity price shocks caused by the pandemic and accentuated by the war in Ukraine triggered a flaring up of inflation, both headline and core, across the world in 2021-2022 to multi-decade high levels. While more recently inflation is easing, a sticky core and its potential spillovers to headline inflation have emerged as the key policy concern. If headline inflation converges to core inflation, then increases in food and energy inflation may not lead to a persistent rise in headline. By contrast, if core inflation converges to headline, this would indicate second-round effects that can cause inflation expectations to rise, triggering appropriate responses from monetary policy makers (Cecchetti and Moessner, 2008). Long run equation: Headline inflation= \u03b2. Core inflation + error correction Long run equation: Core inflation= \u03b2. Headline inflation + error correction To explore these feedback mechanisms, a panel regression for 26 economies (comprising both AEs and EMEs) for January 2012 to July 2023 is undertaken which indicates cointegration between core and headline inflation. Accordingly, a vector error correction model (VECM) is estimated by using the pooled mean group (PMG) approach (Pesaran et al., 1999). The short-run dynamics indicate that the coefficients of the error correction terms in both the equations are negative and statistically significant. Thus, in the case of a shock, both core and headline inflation adjust, and the speed of adjustment in headline inflation towards core is somewhat higher than in the core inflation equation4 (Table V.1.1). The potential two-way spillovers and the generalisation of inflation risks can warrant priority in policy settings to contain them quickly, which vindicates the \u2018higher for longer\u2019 stance going forward.

Core CPI inflation eased from 5.6 per cent to 4.3 per cent during the same period. Inflation in terms of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index \u2013 the US Federal Reserve (Fed)\u2019s preferred measure of inflation \u2013 moderated from 4.4 per cent in March to 3.5 per cent in August (Chart V.4a), while core PCE inflation fell from 4.8 per cent to 3.9 per cent (Chart V.4b). eased to 6.7 per cent in August 2023 from 10.1 per cent in March 2023 while core inflation at 6.2 per cent in August was unchanged from its level in March. In Japan, CPI inflation (all items less fresh food) was 3.1 per cent in August 2023, the same level as in March, though core inflation (inflation excluding fresh food and energy) edged up to 4.3 per cent in August from 3.8 per cent in March 2023. In the Euro area, CPI inflation eased by 260 bps to 4.3 per cent in September 2023 from 6.9 per cent in March. Core inflation (inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco) moderated by only 120 bps to 4.5 per cent in September. In the UK, CPI inflation Amongst major EMEs, CPI in Brazil moderated during March-June 2023 but then edged up to 4.6 per cent in August 2023 (Chart V.4c).

In China, headline inflation remained subdued during 2023 \u2013 it moderated from 0.7 per cent in March 2023 to 0.1 per cent in August (with a temporary descent into deflation of 0.3 per cent in July), reflecting weak demand. Core inflation across EMEs has generally remained stickier than headline inflation (Chart V.4d). During Q2 and Q3 of 2023, major central banks across AEs and EMEs hiked their benchmark rates in steps of 25 bps or retained their policy rates at restrictive levels. A few central banks especially among EMEs initiated an easing cycle in response to a softening inflation trajectory. 2023 meeting, it decided to discontinue reinvestments under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) from July 2023 while continuing to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) until at least the end of 2024. In its July meeting, the ECB reduced the remuneration of minimum reserves to zero per cent (the remuneration was at the deposit facility rate earlier). The Bank of England (BoE) raised its policy rate in its May 2023 meeting by 25 bps, followed by 50 bps in June and 25 bps in August, taking the cumulative increase to 515 bps in the current tightening cycle that started in December 2021. The BoE maintained its policy rate at 5.25 per cent in its September meeting while announcing an enhanced reduction of \u00a3100 billion in the stock of UK government bonds. After initiating the tightening cycle in March 2022, the US Fed raised the target range for the federal funds rate in all its subsequent policy meetings till May 2023 although it reduced the size of rate increase to 25 bps from hikes of 50 and 75 bps in 2022. In its June 2023 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to pause for the first time in over a year following a cumulative increase of 500 bps. In its July meeting, the Fed raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 bps to 5.25-5.50 per cent, taking it to its highest level in 22 years and maintained the level in its September meeting (Chart V.5a). As per the Summary of Economic Projections released in September 2023, the majority of FOMC participants expected the federal funds rate to be in the range of 5.5-5.75 per cent by end 2023 and 5.0-5.25 per cent by end 2024, indicating further monetary tightening this year and fewer rate cuts next year as compared to June projections. The US Fed also continued with its balance sheet reduction policy. The ECB increased its policy rate by 25 bps in each of its May-September 2023 meetings, cumulatively increasing the benchmark rate by 450 bps. In its May Amongst other major AEs, the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate by 25 bps each in its June and July 2023 meetings after a pause in the previous two meetings (March and April 2023) \u2013 a cumulative hike of 475 bps in the current tightening cycle. It kept the rate unchanged in its September 2023 meeting. The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its cash rate target by 25 bps each in its May and June meetings while pausing in the July-September meetings. It has cumulatively increased its policy rate by 400 bps since May 2022. The Norges Bank and the Bank of Korea have raised their policy rates by 375 bps and 250 bps, respectively, since 2022 while the Central Bank of Iceland and the Czech National Bank effected cumulative hikes of 725 bps and 325 bps, respectively (Chart V.5a). On the other hand, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remained an outlier, maintaining an accommodative stance with the overnight interest rate on hold at minus 0.1 per cent. The BoJ in its July 2023 meeting, however, amended the conduct of yield curve control (YCC) to incorporate greater flexibility regarding the upper and lower bounds as references. It offered to purchase 10- Amongst the BRICS, the Banco Central do Brasil started a rate cut cycle in August 2023 with a reduction of 50 bps after raising rates cumulatively by 1175 bps between March 2021 and August 2022. It was followed by another 50 bps cut in September 2023. The South African Reserve Bank continued with the tightening cycle and increased its policy rate by 50 bps in its May 2023 meeting, cumulatively increasing its benchmark rate by 475 bps before pausing in its July and September meetings. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) adopted an accommodative monetary policy stance, effecting its first cut in 10 months in the policy rates in June 2023. In August, it further reduced its 1-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) and 7-day reverse repurchase agreements rate by 10 bps each and the 1-year medium-term lending facility loans rate by 15 bps while maintaining the 5-year LPR at 4.20 per cent. In September it reduced its reserve requirement ratio by 25 bps for all banks except those that have implemented a 5 per cent reserve ratio. The Bank of Russia (BoR) switched gears by commencing a tightening cycle in July 2023, increasing the policy rate by 100 bps to contain price stability risks, following it by increases of 350 bps in an off-cycle meeting in August and 100 bps in the September meeting, taking the policy rate to 13.0 per cent. Earlier, it had cumulatively cut the policy rate by 1250 bps between April-September 2022 and held it steady for the next 6 meetings until June 2023 (Chart V.5b). Amongst Asian EMEs, the Bank of Thailand, which embarked on the tightening cycle in August 2022, raised the rate by 25 bps in all its subsequent meetings. The Bank Indonesia maintained its policy rate at 5.75 per cent in all its meetings since February 2023. In Latin America, central banks of Mexico and Colombia held their policy rates constant in all meetings since May 2023. On the other hand, Chile lowered its policy rate by 175 bps to 9.5 per cent during July-September 2023, after hiking it by 1075 bps between July 2021 and October 2022. Peru cut its policy rate by 25 bps in its September meeting after holding it steady for seven months. Among European EMEs, Poland embarked on a rate cutting cycle, lowering its policy rate by 75 bps in its September meeting after keeping it on hold since October 2022. The central bank of Turkey raised its policy rate by 2150 bps between June and September 2023, after cutting it cumulatively by 550 bps between August 2022 and February 2023. Global financial markets exhibited high flux during Q2 and Q3, responding to changing expectations on the monetary policy trajectory. Markets turned buoyant during April-July 2023 as prospects of hard landing receded and hopes of an end to the monetary tightening cycle in the US, earlier than expected, gained ground. Financial markets corrected in Q3 on stronger data and 'higher for longer' monetary policy stances. Overall, bond yields have firmed up since the last MPR. The US dollar has remained volatile with a strengthening bias since August. The EME currencies broadly weakened since Q2:2023. Equity markets, in terms of MSCI world index, gained 1.6 per cent since end March reflecting gains in AEs equity markets (Chart V.6a). Among AEs, US S&P 500 gained about 8 per cent in Q2:2023 supported by better economic data, optimism over the peaking of policy rates and a rally in technology stocks. In August and September, however, sentiment took a blow from the rise in long-term bond yields and the hawkish tone in minutes of the FOMC\u2019s July meeting and FOMC's statement of September. Overall, the US S&P index rose by 4.3 per cent during April-September 2023. The European stock market underperformed, given relatively weak economic data. The UK\u2019s stock indices declined in Q2 as consumer price inflation slowed less than anticipated, but reversed the trend in Q3 with lower than expected inflation print. The Japanese market outperformed its peers on continuation of ultra-accommodative monetary policy by the BoJ. EME equities, barring China and South Africa in Q2, gained, tracking global cues and reaping benefits of an early commencement of the tightening cycle leading to lower inflation prints (Chart V.6b). In Q3, however, EME equities barring Russia and India corrected on tighter financial conditions globally and volatile capital flows. Chinese stocks lost ground amidst the flagging economic recovery. Portfolio outflows exerted downward pressures on equities. Sovereign bond yields across major AEs hardened in Q2:2023 and Q3, reflecting ongoing monetary tightening and the slow pace of disinflation. The US 10-year treasury yield rose by 37 bps during Q2 and rose further in Q3 to its highest level since 2007 following a hawkish policy stance, announcement of larger debt issuance by the US Treasury and the sovereign rating downgrade by Fitch Ratings. The German 10-year bond yield broadly tracked the US market while the UK 10-year yield hardened before moderating on a benign inflation print for July. The 10-year Japanese Government bond yield hardened by 36 bps during Q3 pushed up by the BoJ\u2019s incorporation of greater flexibility in its conduct of yield curve control (Chart V.7a). bps following modest inflation prints.

The US dollar\u2019s volatility Bond yields in several EMEs exhibited a hardening bias, driven by domestic monetary tightening as well as global cues (Chart V.7b). Brazilian 10-year bond yield softened in the second quarter of 2023 by 219 was mirrored in the EME currencies, exacerbated b: Portfolio Flows to EMEs Global growth is losing momentum, with downside risks to the outlook from stubborn core inflation, tight financial conditions, high public debt, weak recovery in China, geopolitical tensions, geoeconomic fragmentation and extreme weather events. Inflation is easing unevenly across countries but rules above the target, especially in advanced economies. Core inflation is softening at a more moderate pace than is imparting volatility to global financial markets. in an environment in which financial conditions are ", "file5": "Domestic economic activity remains resilient in a slowing global economy. Inflation has persisted at elevated levels across the world and in India. Monetary policy remains focussed on progressively aligning inflation with the target. Geopolitical hostilities, volatile global financial markets and climate shocks are the key risks to the growth and the inflation outlook. Since the release of the September 2022 Monetary Policy Report (MPR), the persistence of inflation at elevated levels across economies, continuing geopolitical uncertainties, and tightening financial conditions are taking their toll on global economic activity. Most central banks remain in tightening mode. Financial markets have turned volatile and highly sensitive to incoming information. Sovereign bond yields softened during November-December on hopes of a monetary policy pivot towards smaller rate hikes but hardened during February on stronger than anticipated economic activity and unrelenting price pressures. US short-term bond yields reached their highest levels in a decade and a half in early March. Equity markets recovered some lost ground. Crude oil and natural gas prices eased to their pre-war levels, but metal prices remain firm. Globally, supply conditions have improved in recent months. The banking turmoil in the US and Europe and the accompanying financial stability concerns rattled global financial markets in March. Increased risk aversion triggered flight to safety and the expectations of an early reversal of the monetary tightening cycle led to a sharp decline in sovereign bond yields across maturities, correction in equity prices and jump in market volatility indicators. The US dollar has retreated unevenly from its September 2022 highs. Domestic economic activity exhibited resilience in H2:2022-23. The National Statistical Office\u2019s (NSO's) second advance estimates placed real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.0 per cent for 2022-23, driven by private consumption and investment. Real GDP growth in Q3 was 4.4 per cent (year-on-year, y-o-y), boosted by investment demand while private consumption slowed. On the supply side, activity was supported by agriculture and services sectors, while manufacturing was restrained under the pressure of high input costs. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation persisted at elevated levels during 2022-23, impacted by a series of adverse supply shocks and the continuing pass- through of high input costs. Briefly edging into the tolerance band during November-December with the stronger than usual seasonal correction in food prices, it surged again to 6.4 per cent (y-o-y) in February as food inflation rose. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) increased the policy repo rate by 250 basis points (bps) during May 2022-February 2023 and monetary policy remains focussed on progressively aligning inflation with the target, while supporting growth. When the MPC met in September 2022, CPI headline inflation was at 7.0 per cent in August. Domestic economic activity was gaining traction ahead of the festival season with double digit GDP growth in Q1:2022-23. CPI headline inflation was projected to remain above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through the first three quarters of 2022-231. The MPC felt that further calibrated monetary policy action was 1 The GDP growth forecast was revised downward by 20 bps to 7.0 per cent (relative to the August 2022 projections) while the inflation forecast was retained at 6.7 per cent for 2022-23. The GDP growth forecast was revised to 6.8 per cent in the December 2022 meeting and the inflation forecast to 6.5 per cent in the February 2023 meeting of the MPC. necessary to keep inflation expectations anchored, restrain the broadening of price pressures and pre- empt second round effects. Accordingly, the MPC raised the policy repo rate by 50 bps to 5.9 per cent with a 5-1 vote. One member voted for a smaller increase of 35 bps. The MPC also decided by a majority of 5-1 to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. At the time of its December 2022 meeting2, the MPC noted that the CPI inflation print in October was persisting above the tolerance band. Real GDP registered a growth of 6.3 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2022- 23. The MPC observed that while headline inflation was likely to moderate in H1:2023-24, it would still be well above the target. Economic activity had held up well and was expected to remain resilient. The impact of monetary policy measures undertaken needed to be monitored carefully. Against this backdrop, the MPC increased the policy repo rate by 35 bps to 6.25 per cent with a 5-1 vote and continued with its stance of withdrawal of accommodation on a 4 to 2 majority vote. In the run up to the February 2023 meeting, CPI headline inflation had eased to 5.7 per cent in December 2022, driven by strong deflation in vegetable prices even as inflationary pressures became accentuated across other food items and in the core category. Domestic economic activity was expected to be sustained by the focus on capital and infrastructure spending in the Union Budget 2023-24. Looking beyond the transitory respite in inflation due to the fall in vegetable prices, the MPC regarded inflation as a major risk to the outlook and observed that further calibrated monetary policy action was warranted to keep inflation expectations inflation persistence and anchored, break core thereby strengthen medium-term growth prospects. Accordingly, the MPC increased the policy repo rate by 25 bps to 6.50 per cent and committed to continue withdrawal of accommodation with a 4-2 vote for both the rate action and the stance decision. The MPC\u2019s voting pattern reflects the diversity in individual members\u2019 assessments, expectations and policy preferences, a characteristic also reflected in voting patterns of other central banks (Table I.1). Chapters analyse macroeconomic developments related to inflation and economic activity during H2:2022-23 (October 2022-March 2023). The evolution of key macroeconomic and financial variables over the past six months warrants revisions in the baseline assumptions (Table I.2). 2 A separate meeting of the MPC was held on November 3, 2022 to discuss and draft the report to be sent to the Government by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the provisions of Section 45ZN of the RBI Act, 1934 and Regulation 7 of the RBI MPC and Monetary Policy Process Regulations, 2016, consequent to inflation exceeding 6 per cent, the upper tolerance threshold around the target, for three successive quarters \u2013 Q4:2021-22 (6.3 per cent), Q1:2022-23 (7.3 per cent) and Q2 (7.0 per cent). First, international crude prices eased in H2 on slowing global growth and a milder than expected winter in Europe. Geopolitical tensions and output curtailment by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus (OPEC plus) impart significant uncertainty to the outlook (Chart I.1.a & Chart I.1.b). Global petrol and diesel prices, which are the key determinant of domestic product prices, are elevated in view of demand-supply refinery mismatches (Chart I.1.c). Taking into account these developments, crude prices (Indian basket) are assumed at US$ 85 per barrel in the baseline as compared with US$ 105 in the September MPR baseline. Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. Second, the nominal exchange rate of the Indian rupee or INR moved in a range of INR 81-83 per US dollar (USD) in H2. The INR was supported by a correction in the US dollar while risk-off sentiments towards emerging market economies (EME) assets and a widening current account deficit exerted downward pressures on the currency. Taking these developments into consideration, the exchange rate is assumed at INR 82 per US dollar in the baseline as against INR 80 in the September 2022 MPR. Third, while global economic prospects have improved modestly compared to a few months ago, the outlook is highly uncertain. The global composite purchasing managers index (PMI) moved into expansion mode in February after remaining in the contraction territory for six consecutive months during July 2022 - January 2023. According to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF\u2019s) January 2023 update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO), global growth is expected to moderate from 3.4 per cent in 2022 to 2.9 per cent in 2023, and 3.1 per cent in 2024, with a sharper deceleration projected for advanced economies (AEs) relative to emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) (Chart I.2). Alongside, global trade is expected to decelerate in 2023. Adverse supply shocks and the pass-through of inputs costs to output prices imparted sustained upward pressures on CPI inflation in H2 (Chapter II). Looking ahead, the three months ahead and the one year ahead median inflation expectations of urban households fell by 30 bps each in the March 2023 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey3. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate decreased for both the horizons vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round (Chart I.3). Manufacturing firms polled in the January-March 2023 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expected the pace of increase in cost of raw materials to remain steady and in selling prices to moderate in Q1:2023-24 (Chart I.4a).4 Services sector and infrastructure firms expected modest softening in the growth of input cost and selling prices in Q1:2023-24 (Charts I.4b and I.4c).5 In the PMI surveys, manufacturing and services firms lower input cost inflation but higher reported in March compared to output price February 2023. 3 The Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 (18 cities in the previous rounds) and the results of the March 2023 round are based on responses from 6,075 households. 4 The results of the January-March 2023 round of the industrial outlook survey are based on responses from 1066 companies. 5 Based on 522 services companies and 116 infrastructure firms polled in the January-March 2023 round of the services and infrastructure outlook survey. Note: Net response is the difference between the share of respondents reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism. The range is -100 to 100. A positive/ negative value of net response is considered as optimistic/pessimistic from the view point of respondent firms. Therefore, higher positive values of selling prices indicate increase in output prices while lower values for the cost of raw materials/cost of inputs indicate higher input price pressures and vice versa. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in March 2023 expected CPI inflation to moderate from 6.2 per cent in Q4:2022-23 to 5.0 per cent in Q1:2023-24, 5.3 per cent in Q2, 5.5 per cent in Q3 and 5.2 per cent in Q4 (Chart I.5a and Table I.3).6 The respondents expected CPI inflation excluding food and beverages, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, and fuel and light to move from 6.2 per cent in Q4:2022-23 to 5.4-5.6 per cent during 2023-24.

Looking ahead, the inflation outlook will be conditioned by several factors, both global and domestic. While crude oil and commodity prices have corrected in recent months, their future trajectories remain uncertain, given the lingering geopolitical hostilities and likely demand rebound from countries reopening from pandemic-related lockdowns. Global financial markets are exhibiting volatility. Domestically, the expectations of a bumper rabi harvest augur well for the future trajectory of food inflation. On the other hand, adverse weather shocks are becoming more frequent and there is heightened uncertainty about the south-west monsoon rains. Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from structural and other time- series models7, CPI inflation is projected to average 5.2 per cent in 2023-24 \u2013 5.1 per cent in Q1:2023-24, 5.4 per cent in Q2 and Q3, and 5.2 per cent in Q4, with risks evenly balanced (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2023-24 are 3.8-6.6 per cent and 3.1-7.3 per cent, respectively. For 2024-25, assuming a normal monsoon, a progressive normalisation of supply chains, and no further exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will average 4.5 per cent. In Q4:2024-25, CPI inflation is projected at 4.4 per cent, with the 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals at 3.0-5.8 per cent and 2.2-6.5 per cent, respectively. The baseline forecasts are subject to several upside and downside risks, given the volatile global environment and the cross-country experience with large deviations of inflation from forecasts (Box I.1). Upside risks emanate from possible escalation of geopolitical conflicts, higher global crude and commodity prices, Since the pandemic, overlapping supply and demand shocks have led to inflation surging to its highest levels since the 1970s and 1980s, with increased volatility (Chart I.1.1). This has led to large inflation forecast errors by both central banks and market forecasters (Chahad et al, 2022; Reserve Bank of Australia, 2022). The Phillips curve framework \u2013 the workhorse model for inflation forecasting \u2013 appears to have broken down in the face of large shocks and non-linearities. An analysis of inflation forecasts among a sample of eight central banks8 shows a deterioration in forecasting performance during the pandemic period. The forecast errors were higher for longer horizons and for the advanced economies. Forecast errors in India were the lowest in this cross-country comparison (Chart I.1.2). Note: Inflation is expressed as y-o-y percent change. Data for the US pertain to Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation. Sources: Bloomberg; RBI staff estimates. Prior to the pandemic, forecast errors were statistically not different from zero (as suggested by the statistically insignificant constant term) and hence they can be regarded as unbiased. More recent forecasts have been biased, with actual outcomes systematically overshooting Observations Country fixed effects Note: ***, **, * denote the level of significance at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively. p-values are in parentheses.

A dynamic panel data model estimated for a sample of seven countries covering the period Q1:2017-Q4:2022 by the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) (Arellano and Bond, 1991) shows high persistence in forecast errors (Table I.1.2). The substantial increases in international energy and food prices, combined with currency depreciations, seem to be the key drivers of the forecast errors. Note: ***, **, * denote the level of significance at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively. p-values are in parentheses.

Overall, the global experience suggests that forecast errors can turn sizeable in the face of large supply shocks and complicate the conduct of forward-looking monetary policy. In such a dynamic and uncertain environment, there is a need to supplement baseline forecasts with alternate scenarios and modelling approaches for more precision. an Application to Employment Equations\u201d, The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 58, No.2, April.

Downside risks could stem from an early resolution of geopolitical tensions, correction in global crude and commodity prices due to slowing global demand, and further improvement in supply conditions. 9 The unbiasedness of forecasts is evaluated by estimating the following equation: error at different horizons made by central banks and captures the effect of the pandemic on the forecast error.

Slowing global growth, geopolitical tensions, upsurge in financial market volatility and tightening global financial conditions, however, weigh heavily on the outlook. Turning to the key messages from forward-looking surveys, consumer confidence (the current situation index) improved in the March 2023 survey round vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round on account of improved perceptions situation, employment and household income, though it remains in the pessimistic zone. Consumers\u2019 expectations for the year ahead continued in the optimistic territory, albeit with some moderation (Chart I.7).11 The optimism of firms in the manufacturing sector ebbed for the quarter ahead relative to the previous round in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey (Chart I.8a).

Taking into account the baseline assumptions, survey indicators and model forecasts, real GDP growth is expected at 6.5 per cent in 2023-24 \u2013 7.8 per cent in Q1; 6.2 per cent in Q2; 6.1 per cent in Q3; and 5.9 per cent in Q4 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path (Chart I.10 and Table I.3). For 2024-25, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks, the structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 6.5 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 5.5-7.0 per cent.

On the contrary, an escalation in geopolitical tensions, a further hardening of international crude oil and other commodity prices, sustained disruptions to supply chains, persistence of global financial market volatility, a sharper loss of momentum in global trade and demand and weather-related disruptions pose downside risks to the baseline growth path. The baseline projections of growth and inflation in this chapter are inter alia conditional on assumptions of the future trajectory of key domestic and international macroeconomic variables set out in Table I.2. The uncertainties surrounding these assumptions have increased significantly due to protracted geopolitical tensions, upside globally, inflation international financial market volatility and recurrent adverse weather events. Against this backdrop, this section explores plausible alternative scenarios to assess the balance of risks around the baseline projections. Global growth is slowing with significant downside risks to the baseline outlook. Globally, inflation remains the key concern and more monetary tightening may be warranted to quell it. This could, however, push global interest rates higher for longer than currently anticipated. Debt servicing costs could escalate and add to financial stability risks. Moreover, geopolitical tensions could ratchet up further. In such a scenario, if global growth is 100 bps lower than the baseline, domestic growth and inflation could be around 30 bps and 15 bps, respectively, below the baseline trajectories. Conversely, if inflation in major economies retreats quickly and global financial conditions ease, geopolitical tensions ebb and global growth surprises on the upside by turning out to be higher by 50 bps, domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by around 15 bps and 7 bps, respectively (Charts I.11a and I.12a). International crude oil prices have eased since the last The INR depreciated relative to the US$ in H2:2022- MPR but remain volatile.

Assuming international crude oil prices to be 10 baseline in such a scenario, inflation could edge up growth could be higher by 30 bps and weaker by by around 35 bps while GDP growth could be higher around 15 bps, respectively. Conversely, an early de- escalation of geopolitical tensions and subdued global demand owing to aggressive monetary policy action may lead to a moderation in global crude oil prices and outlook is relatively better than peers, it could become attractive for foreign investors. Furthermore, below the baseline. If, as a result, the Indian basket of crude prices falls by 10 per cent and assuming full could appreciate relative to the baseline. With five per could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 15 bps to the monsoon from its normal pattern are occurring weather events could lead to upward pressures on food prices which could raise headline inflation by around 50 bps (Charts I.11b and I.12b). On the other hand, the government, and an improving global food situation could exert downward pressures on food inflation and The Indian economy is expected to be amongst the fastest growing major economies in 2023-24, backed by strong domestic drivers and strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals. The Indian financial sector remains stable. Headline inflation is expected to moderate from its prevailing elevated levels and move below the upper tolerance band during 2023- 24. Monetary policy remains focused on progressively aligning target. Geopolitical hostilities, stubborn global inflation, volatile global financial markets and climate shocks are the key risks to the growth and the inflation outlook. risk are strongly conditional on the evolving weather The path of inflation in H2:2022-23 was buffeted by overlapping domestic food supply shocks which kept inflation above the upper tolerance band barring a transient softening in November-December 2022. Core inflation persisted at elevated levels in spite of input costs moderating with the softening in international commodity prices. Since the September 2022 MPR, the headline CPI inflation1 path has been impacted by domestic food supply shocks amidst weather vagaries and the pass- through of pent-up input costs. A transitory but more than anticipated seasonal correction in vegetable prices during November-December 2022 brought some relief but this reversed in January-February 2023 due to sustained price pressures from cereals and spices and a pick-up in protein-based food inflation. With improving domestic demand conditions, input costs were steadily passed on to retail prices of goods and services, imparting considerable stickiness to the already elevated core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation2. prices that also commenced earlier than usual - the month-on-month (m-o-m) decline in prices of CPI vegetables at (-) 8.3 per cent in November 2022 was the highest in the current CPI (2012=100) series for the month of November (Chart II.2). This was followed by an even larger decline in vegetable prices in December. In fact, the cumulative price decline of around 20 per cent in November-December turned out to be the highest in the current CPI series. In Q4 (January- February 2023), the situation reversed, with higher than anticipated cereal price inflation catapulting inflation by around 70 bps above projections. Forecast errors in Q4 were also attributable to the CPI Reflecting these multiple shocks, headline inflation averaged 7.1 per cent (year-on-year, y-o-y) during September-October before a short-lived dip to 5.7 per cent by December. A resurgence of food price pressures pushed headline inflation to 6.5 per cent during January-February 2023. Core inflation hovered at or above 6 per cent throughout H2 (Chart II.1). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections, if any, and to explain the underlying reasons thereof. The September 2022 MPR had projected inflation at 6.5 per cent for Q3:2022-23 and 5.8 per cent for Q4. Actual inflation trailed the projection by 40 bps in Q3 mainly due to the sharper than expected seasonal correction in vegetables 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year changes in the all-India consumer price index (CPI) produced by the National Statistical Office (NSO). The y-o-y inflation numbers for April and May 2021 have been calculated based on the imputed index for April and May 2020 released by NSO. 2 Core CPI, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups \u2018food and beverages\u2019 and \u2018fuel and light\u2019 from the headline CPI. positive price momentum. In October, the headline inflation softened by around 60 bps to 6.8 per cent on account of strong favourable base effects across food, fuel and core categories, despite a further pick- up in the price momentum. Thereafter, headline CPI momentum registered a decline driven by lower food prices. This, along with favourable base effects, moderated headline inflation by close to 90 bps in November. A further sharp correction in headline momentum in December, despite an unfavourable base, led to a second consecutive month of softening in headline inflation. In January 2023, the positive price momentum in food and core categories and an adverse base effect pulled headline inflation up by 80 bps to 6.5 per cent. In February, the decline in food prices along with a favourable base effect led to a marginal softening in headline inflation to 6.4 per cent (Chart II.3). aggregation methodology due to the redistribution of weights away from the freely distributed rice and wheat under the public distribution system (PDS) towards high market price cereal items3, and to the depreciation of the rupee vis-\u00e0-vis the US$ relative to the September 2022 MPR baseline assumption. The distribution of CPI during 2022-23 revealed a pattern distinct from the previous year. The mean of the distribution rose to 6.8 per cent in 2022-23 (April-February) from 5.5 per cent during 2021-22 while lower standard deviation and a lower positive skew pointed towards the generalisation of inflation pressures in the CPI basket (Chart II.4 and II.5). Headline inflation dynamics in H2 reflected the interplay of volatile food price momentum and base effects4. The acceleration in headline inflation to 7.4 per cent in September 2022, an increase of around 40 bps from August, came from a broad-based The broad-basing of price pressures was also visible in CPI diffusion indices (DIs)5, which increased during September 2022 to January 2023, driven by CPI goods, with some moderation in February 3 The zero price for PDS wheat and rice due to free distribution resulted in the transfer of their weights to other items in the cereals group (Das, Praggya and Asish Thomas George (2023), \u201cConsumer Price Index: The Aggregation Method Matters\u201d, Reserve Bank of India Bulletin, March). 4 A change in CPI y-o-y inflation between any two months is the difference between the current m-o-m change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details, see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. 5 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. The higher the reading above 50, the broader is the expansion or generalisation of price increases; the further is the reading below 50, the broader is the price decline across items. d: CPI excluding Food and Fuel (Chart II.6a). The threshold DI6 for price increases remained in excess of 6 per cent on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (saar) basis on an average during the last six months (Chart II.6b). 6 Threshold diffusion indices capture the dispersion of price increases in CPI basket beyond the specified saar thresholds of 4 per cent and 6 per cent. exerted downward pressure (Chart II.7a). An analysis A historical decomposition of inflation using a vector autoregression (VAR)7 model indicates that supply shocks drove the inflation trajectory in H2, while monetary actions and aggregate demand conditions of supply-side cost-push shocks suggests that while direct effects dominate in terms of their impact on headline CPI, indirect effects can also be significant Elevated inflation and its persistence reflect a series of multiple supply side shocks. It has been observed that as the direct impact of the shocks wane, second-round effects can take hold, causing generalisation of price pressures. Moreover, some sectors are systemically more important than others in this propagation mechanism (Weber et al., 2022). Direct and indirect effect of domestic cost-push shocks to various sectors of the economy can be analysed by using input-output tables (IOTs)8. The IOTs are mapped to CPI items/sub-groups to understand the total impact in the CPI basket from a shock to each of the sectors. The impact of the sectoral shocks on headline inflation is estimated by using the Leontief Inverse Matrix (RBI, 2022), i.e., where L is the Leontief inverse, I is an identity matrix of dimension (J*K x J*K), A is the technical coefficient matrix derived from the IOTs and J and K are the total number of economies and industries. 7 Historical decomposition estimates the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period (Q4:2010-11 to Q4:2022-23) based on a vector autoregression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 crude oil prices (US$ per barrel); exchange rate (INR per US$), asset price (BSE Sensex), CPI; the output gap; rural wages; the policy repo rate; and money supply (M3). All variables other than policy repo rate are y-o-y growth rates. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et; where et represents a vector of shocks. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. 8 The IOTs are based on the Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) tables (OECD, 2021) applied to Indian context. the maximum impact (41 bps) on headline inflation, followed by real estate (10 bps), food products (8 bps) and refined petroleum (7 bps) (Chart II.1.1). Direct effects, which depend on the size of the shock and weights of CPI items, dominate. The indirect effects on CPI inflation are relatively sizeable in the case of shocks to sectors like trade, chemicals, non-metallic minerals and financial activities, although these sectors have no direct impact as they are not part of the CPI basket. Sectors like refined petroleum, land transport, pharmaceuticals and electricity have both direct and indirect effects on CPI inflation. These findings can inform supply responses to recent inflation pressures. The empirical analysis shows that a 1 percentage point shock to each of the sectors can raise CPI inflation by 1.46 percentage points, with an indirect impact of 46 basis points. Sector-wise, shocks to agriculture have cent in overall CPI) to headline inflation averaged averaged 19 per cent. (Chart II.7b). Within goods, well as durables (goods with a 365-day recall) like clothing and footwear items, motor cycle/scooter and gold were the main drivers. The contribution of perishable goods to overall inflation halved to 19 per cent in February 2023 from 38 per cent in September 2022. The increase in global commodity prices following the Ukraine conflict contributed to a surge in the imported components10 during contribution of 9 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Under MMRP, data are collected on expenditures incurred for frequently purchased items \u2013 edible oil, eggs, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, spices, beverages, processed foods, pan, tobacco and intoxicants \u2013 during the last seven days; for clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods, during the last 365 days; and for all other food, fuel and light, miscellaneous goods and services including non-institutional medical services, rents and taxes, data relate to the last 30 days. 10 Global commodities that drive domestic prices include petroleum products; coal; electronic goods; gold; silver; chemical products; metal products; textiles; cereals; milk products, and vegetables oils \u2013 these together have a weight of 36.4 per cent in the CPI basket. March-June 2022. Subsequently, with the decline in international commodity prices, the contribution of imported inflation moderated \u2013 it turned negative during November 2022-February 2023, driven down by the y-o-y fall in in prices of edible oils, LPG, electronic goods parts, polymer, petrol and diesel (Chart II.7c). Inflation in food and beverages (weight of 45.9 per cent in the CPI basket) moderated from 8.4 per cent in September 2022 to 4.6 per cent in December, on the back of sharp correction in vegetable prices alluded to earlier. It, however, rose again to 6.3 per cent by February 2023, as increases in prices of cereals and products, milk and spices outweighed the seasonal easing in vegetables prices. Lower rabi production of wheat and spices, lower kharif production of rice, higher fodder and feed costs, and a decline in wheat buffer stocks led to the hardening of prices of cereals, milk and spices (Chart II.8). Excluding vegetables, CPI food inflation rose from 7.0 per cent during September-October 2022 to 9.0 per cent in February. While the overall food price build-up in 2022-23 was lower than the historical experience, the build-ups in respect of five of the twelve sub-groups \u2013 cereals; eggs; spices; milk; and prepared meals \u2013 were higher than their long-term averages (Chart II.9). increased from less than 10 per cent in August 2022 current CPI series (Chart II.10).

The release of a cumulative 3.4 million tonnes of wheat in the open market by the Government, at a lower reserve price, along with the higher estimated rabi production in 2022-23 (an increase of 4.1 per cent), has led to a gradual ebbing of price pressures. The Government continued with restrictions on wheat exports since May 2022 and banning of exports of wheat flour from August 25, 2022 to improve domestic supplies and ease price pressures. Inflation in rice remained elevated due to decline in kharif production ((-) 2.6 per cent) in 2022- 23. Further, exports also registered higher volumes (6.5 per cent y-o-y during April 2022-January 2023). Note: Figures in parentheses indicate items' weights in CPI-vegetables. Item level data were not released by NSO for the months of March, April and May 2020. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. Inflation in vegetables prices (weight of 6.0 per cent in the CPI and 13.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) remained volatile during 2022-23. It moderated from a high of 18.2 per cent in September 2022 and entered into deflation in November on the back of an early onset of seasonal easing of price pressures, reaching (-)11.6 per cent in February 2023. Onion prices remained in deflation throughout 2022-23 on account of higher production in 2021-22 (an increase of 17.4 per cent), record procurement (buffer stock of 2.5 lakh metric tonnes in 2022-23) and better rabi crop prospects. Potato price inflation, however, generally remained high during the year on lower production in 2021-22 ((-) 5.0 per cent). With stock releases from cold storages and arrivals of the kharif crop, prices declined from November 2022 as per the seasonal pattern, leading inflation to turn negative in February 2023. Imports of potatoes from Bhutan till June 2023, without the need for any import license, also reined in price pressures. Tomato prices exhibited high volatility due to a setback to production from heat wave in major producing states, cyclone Asani in Andhra Pradesh and excess/unseasonal rains. Prices fell from November as per the seasonal pattern and on expectations of good production owing to increased group) was relatively subdued, averaging 4.5 per cent in 2022-23 (April-February).

To augment extended the period for free import of tur and urad to March 2024, increased the procurement ceiling under 40 per cent for tur, urad and masoor and allowed disposal of chana to states at a discounted price under the PSS. Government has stepped up monitoring of stock disclosures and futures trading in chana has been banned. November 2022, inflation in meat and fish (weight of 3.6 per cent in CPI and 7.9 per cent within the food and beverages group) increased to 6.0 per cent in January 2023 before moderating sharply in February 2023 due to a correction in prices as well as a favourable base effect. On the whole, record pulses production during 2022-23 at 278 lakh tonnes and a higher stock-to-use (STU) ratio augur well for domestic availability and effective price management (Chart II.13). Inflation in animal-based protein items increased sharply in H2:2022-23 (October-February), driven mainly by milk and products (weight of 6.6 per cent in the CPI and 14.4 per cent within the food and beverages group) (Chart II.14). Major milk co- operatives like Amul and Mother Dairy raised retail prices by `2-3 per litre in two and three spells since September 2022, respectively, followed by other state cooperatives, attributed to increase in feedstock costs. Inflation in prices of eggs increased during November 2022-January 2023 due to high feed cost and a spurt in exports to Malaysia before easing to 4.3 per cent in February 2023. After remaining muted during July- Note: Figures in parentheses indicate items' weights in CPI-animal protein group. H2:2022-23 refers to October-February.

Among other food items, inflation in prices of spices averaged 16.0 per cent during April 2022-February 2023, reflecting production shortfalls in key spices, especially dry chillies, cumin and coriander in 2021- 22. Prepared meals prices rose due to the gradual pass- through of past increases in input costs from edible oils, LPG and transport costs. Inflation in prices of oils and fats (weight of 3.6 per cent in the CPI and 7.8 per cent within the food and beverages group), which was elevated in the initial months of 2022-23 due to increase in global prices in the aftermath of the conflict in Ukraine and an export ban on palm oil by Indonesia, eased considerably to (-)0.5 per cent in February 2023 (Chart II.15). This moderation was supported by easing global prices, supply-side measures by the Government (extension of reduction in basic customs duty on crude and refined oils and imposition of stock limits on edible oil and oil seeds) and higher estimated domestic production of oilseeds in 2022-23 (5.4 per cent). Inflation in prices of sugar and confectionery (weight of 1.4 per cent in the CPI and 3.0 per cent in the food and beverages group) moderated sharply in September 2022 and remained muted in the subsequent months on the back of higher domestic production and export Retail price margins \u2013 the difference of retail and wholesale prices11 \u2013 for cereals and pulses remained elevated during 2022-23. Retail margins rose for edible oils as decline in retail prices (groundnut, soyabean, sunflower and mustard oil) was less than that in wholesale prices. Margins picked up in September-November 2022 in the case of vegetables, driven by all the three constituents, i.e., potatoes, tomatoes and onions. Subsequently, there was a sharp seasonal correction in prices and margins (Chart II.16). CPI fuel inflation during September 2022 to February 2023 was high and sticky in a range of 9.9 per cent to 10.9 per cent. While domestic LPG prices remained unchanged till February 2023, kerosene (PDS) prices fell after July 2022 in line with international prices. Kerosene prices inflation moderated from around 60 per cent in September 2022 to 30 per cent by February 2023. Electricity prices, on the other hand, moved out of deflation in November 2022 and have remained largely steady since then. Firewood and chips inflation 11 Item level retail and wholesale prices are aggregated at respective sub-groups using item level CPI weights. Data for January-March 2021 have been excluded due to changes in price collection mechanism and item varieties by DCA. pressures rose during Q3 before moderating in February (Chart II.17). Core inflation (CPI inflation excluding food and fuel) exhibited stickiness at or above 6 per cent in H2. Elevated inflation pressures were visible across all exclusion-based measures of core inflation (Table II.1). In 2020-21, high core inflation was due to price pressures in select categories like transport and communication, and personal care and effects. Since 2021-22, however, it has become increasingly generalised and persistent (Chart II.18). During 2022-23 (April-February), core inflation averaged 6.1 per cent vis-\u00e0-vis 6.0 per cent in 2021-22.

The contribution of core services increased during 2022-23 while that of core goods fell (Chart II.19). Petrol and diesel prices moved into deflation on a y-o-y basis during August-November 2022 and stood at 0.9 per cent in February, resulting in a significant drop in transport and communication inflation and its contribution to CPI core inflation (Chart II.21). On the other hand, gold prices firmed up y-o-y, resulting in an increase in personal care and effects inflation and its contribution to core inflation. Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in the respective sub-group. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. Threshold diffusion indices for CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver indicate a high number of items registering price increases in excess of 4 per cent during September-October 2022. Since November 2022, the diffusion index for items registering price increases in excess of 6 per cent (saar) has moved lower, suggesting easing in the intensity of price increases (Chart II.22). A decomposition of CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver inflation into its goods (with a weight of 20.7 per cent in the headline CPI) and services (weight of 23.0 per cent) components shows that goods inflation averaged 7.4 per cent during September 2022 to February 2023, higher than services inflation of around 5.4 per cent. The key drivers of goods inflation were clothing and footwear, household goods and services, and health (Chart II.23a). In services inflation, housing (primarily house rental charges) was the largest contributor, followed by transport services (bus/ tram/taxi fares; air fare), and education (tuition and other fees) (Chart II.23b). Trimmed mean measures12 also indicated elevated underlying inflation pressures, with the weighted median inflation rate at 6.8 per cent during December 2022-February 2023 (Table II.2). After ruling in double digits between April 2021 and September 2022, wholesale price index (WPI) inflation CPI inflation for agricultural labourers (CPI-AL) and rural labourers (CPI-RL) exceeded CPI headline inflation during September 2022 - February 2023, primarily on account of food inflation being higher in CPI-AL and CPI-RL. Inflation in terms of CPI for industrial workers (CPI-IW), on the other hand, was below the headline CPI during the same period due to lower inflation in food, clothing and footwear, housing as well as the miscellaneous categories in CPI-IW vis-\u00e0-vis headline CPI. 5% trimmed 10% trimmed 25% trimmed 12 While exclusion-based measures drop a fixed set of volatile items (for example, food and fuel) in each period, trimmed measures exclude items located in the tails of the inflation distribution - items displaying changes more than the specified threshold in prices each month are excluded, and the items dropped differ from month to month.

The sharp moderation in WPI inflation pulled down inflation measured by the deflators for gross value added (GVA) and gross domestic product (GDP) in Q3:2022-23 (Chart II.24a). While WPI inflation outpaced CPI inflation in the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine, it moved below CPI inflation since December 2022. During September 2022-February 2023, CPI inflation ruled above the corresponding WPI groups/ sub-groups in respect of spices, fruits, protein- based goods (pulses, egg and milk), and clothing and footwear. Deflation in edible oil and vegetable prices was higher in the WPI than in the CPI. On the other hand, inflation in fuel, petrol and diesel was higher in the former vis-\u00e0-vis the latter (Chart II.24b)13. Costs, as measured by WPI inflation relating to industrial raw materials and farm inputs prices, moderated gradually during H2:2022-23 (Chart II.25). Inflation in the prices of industrial inputs \u2013 such as high-speed diesel (HSD); naphtha; aviation turbine fuel (ATF); bitumen; and furnace oil \u2013 eased, mirroring the correction in international crude oil prices. The prices of non-food primary articles, particularly raw cotton and oilseeds softened in tandem with international prices and expectations of higher domestic production. Minerals price inflation moderated and turned to deflation from November 2022, driven by deflation in iron ore prices, and in copper concentrate prices from January 2023. Notwithstanding the easing in HSD prices, farm input price inflation remained elevated on account of high fodder price inflation. Inflation in price 13 The divergence in WPI and CPI petrol and diesel inflation emanated from the fact that while the cut in the central excise duties led to a fall in CPI petrol and diesel prices (on a y-o-y basis), WPI was not impacted as prices in WPI are computed net of domestic excise duty effects. of WPI electricity \u2013 a key input in both industrial and farm inputs \u2013 persisted at elevated levels, reflecting higher input costs on the back of firmer international coal prices and increased domestic demand. (y-o-y basis) accelerated in Q3:2022-23 for both manufacturing and services sectors. The share of staff Nominal rural wage growth for both agricultural and non-agricultural labourers increased during October 2022-January 2023. While agricultural wage growth was broad-based across all occupations, the growth in non-agricultural wages was mainly driven by categories like beedi makers, blacksmiths, masons, electricians, and light motor vehicle (LMV)/tractor drivers (Chart II.26). and services was broadly unchanged in Q3:2022-23 As per the firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s sectors is expected to remain broadly stable in Q1:2023-24.

The survey polls a panel of business leaders primarily from the manufacturing sector about their inflation expectations in the short and medium term. As per manufacturing firms polled for the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), input prices picked up during December-February and output prices in general moderated with the input-output price gap returning to positive territory by February. The month of March saw a reversal in this trend with the gap again turning negative as input prices fell (Chart II.29a). In PMI services, input as well as output prices momentum softened during December-February and the input- output price gap has been largely range-bound since August 2022. There was an uptick in prices charged in the month of March with softening in input prices, leading to narrowing of input output price gap (Chart II.29b). prices exerted sustained pressures on headline inflation during 2022-23. The outlook for 2023-24 is subject to uncertainties surrounding climate-related lead to supply chain dislocations and commodity geopolitical hostilities can soften price pressures. Global demand conditions are turning more uncertain amidst rising financial market turbulence and financial stability concerns, which could weigh in on commodity policy remains focussed on progressively aligning inflation with the target. Pro-active supply measures by the Government remain vital to address bottlenecks A combination of adverse supply-side shocks and the pass-through of pending input costs to output and shortages in critical areas to mitigate volatility in inflation and enable a sustained disinflation. Domestic demand remained resilient in H2:2022-23, with investment activity gaining ground but private consumption exhibiting sluggishness. On the supply side, a rebound in contact-intensive services compensated for manufacturing sector which was pulled down by elevated input cost pressures. Protracted geopolitical tensions, tighter global financial conditions, global financial market volatility and slowing external demand pose risks to the outlook. Domestic demand remained resilient in H2:2022- 23, with investment activity gaining ground on the back of the government\u2019s continued thrust on capex. Private consumption exhibited sluggishness induced with normalisation of pent-up demand and the dampening effect of inflationary pressures. Slowing global demand weighed on merchandise exports; however, with imports declining, the drag from net exports moderated. Overall, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 4.8 per cent in H2:2022-23, up by 12.3 per cent over its pre-pandemic level. On the supply side, the rebound in contact-intensive services was sustained. The manufacturing sector was pulled down by elevated input cost pressures. Spillovers from protracted geopolitical tensions, tighter global financial conditions, global financial market volatility and slowing external demand pose risks to the outlook. Aggregate demand, measured by real GDP, expanded by 4.4 per cent (year-on-year, y-o-y) in Q3:2022-23 and by an estimated 5.1 per cent in Q4 (Chart III.1 and Table III.1). The momentum \u2013 the quarter-on- quarter (q-o-q) seasonally adjusted annualised growth rate (saar) \u2013 remained strong in Q3 and Q4.

The impulse responses indicate that a one standard deviation negative shock to global GDP growth (around 3.5 percentage points) reduces domestic growth by over 2 percentage points with a lag of a quarter (Chart III.1.1). The variance decomposition suggests that global factors explain only 17-18 per cent of the variability in India\u2019s GDP growth, reflecting dominance of domestic growth drivers (Chart III.1.2).

Quarterly data from Q1:1997-98 The September 2022 Monetary Policy Report (MPR) projected real GDP growth at 6.3 per cent for Q2:2022- 23, and 4.6 per cent each for Q3 and Q4. The actual growth rate at 6.3 per cent in Q2 turned out to be in line with the projection (Chart III.2). In Q3, the outturn undershot the projection by 20 basis points (bps) due to lower than expected growth in private consumption and government expenditure.

Consumer durables, on the other hand, contracted in Q3 and January 2023, partly reflecting a shift in households spending from goods to services with the receding pandemic. Rural demand showed some signs of recovery in H2, albeit it is lagging urban demand. Amongst the HFIs, tractor sales grew robustly in H2 while motorcycle The labour force participation rate, as per the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy\u2019s (CMIE) Consumer Pyramid data, remained unchanged in Q4 and the unemployment rate moved lower across both urban and rural segments (Chart III.5a). Organised sector employment, as reflected in the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) payrolls data, strengthened considerably in Q3 and in January 2023 as compared sales growth returned to positive territory with the same period last year (Chart III.5b). According to Naukri Jobspeak data, increased hiring was witnessed in insurance, hospitality, banking, financial services and real estate sectors.

According to the RBI\u2019s survey2, capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector improved marginally however, dropped to 74.1 per cent from 74.5 per cent over the period, although it remained above its long- period average (Chart III.7). The Union Budget 2023- 24 has projected a growth of 37.4 per cent in capital expenditure over its revised estimates for 2022-23 and this is expected to crowd in private investment (Box III.2). The interest coverage ratio (ICR)3 of listed private companies in the manufacturing and information technology (IT) sectors remained comfortable in indicating adequate debt servicing Q3:2022-23, capacity (Chart III.8). The ICR of services sector (non- IT) improved in Q3 and crossed the threshold level of unity for the first time since Q1:2019-20. The investment rate \u2013 the ratio of gross capital formation (GCF) to GDP at current prices \u2013 rose to 31.4 per cent in 2021-22 from 27.9 per cent in the preceding year. Over the same period, the gross domestic saving rate improved to 30.2 per cent of GDP from 28.8 per cent a year ago (Chart III.9), with lower In recent years, the government expanded capital expenditure to improve infrastructure, create additional capacity, enhance productivity and crowd in private investment. Public investment multipliers are higher in emerging market economies (EMEs) with a lower initial stock of public capital (Izquierdo, A. et al., 2019; Serven, 1999; Bahal et al., 2015; RBI, 2019). Against this backdrop, the effect of public investment on private investment is investigated in a SVAR framework for 1980-2019 period. Public investment, private investment, and GDP in real per capita are included in the model (all variables in growth rates), with global GDP growth as a control variable to account for external demand shocks. The impulse responses indicate that a 1 percentage point increase in public investment increases private investment by 0.6 percentage point in the first year and the cumulative impact over a 3-year period is over 1.0 percentage point (Chart III.2.1). The multiplier for public investment on private investment is 1.2 and on overall GDP is 1.7 over a three-year period, well over unity. Thus, the empirical analysis indicates that the government\u2019s focus on capital expenditure in the recent budgets, including the Union Budget 2023-24, could be effective in stimulating private investment and domestic demand with beneficial effects accruing over time.

The net household financial saving \u2013 the source of funding for deficit sectors \u2013 moderated to 7.6 per cent of GDP in 2021-22 from 11.5 per cent in 2020-21, reflecting a surge in consumption and associated drawdown in precautionary saving.

In 2022-23, the centre\u2019s gross market borrowing stood at `14.21 lakh crore as against `14.37 lakh crore planned in the indicative calendars for H1 and H2. The Reserve Bank also conducted eleven switch auctions States\u2019 revenue receipts remained buoyant across all sub-components (Chart III.13a). Capital expenditure grew by 12.5 per cent during April-January 2022-23 despite contracting in Q1 (Chart III.13b). The states have spent around 53 per cent of their budgeted capital expenditure during this period, in line with past trends. The Central Government released the fourteenth instalment of tax devolution amounting on behalf of the central government amounting to `1.05 lakh crore for debt consolidation. The weighted average cost of issuances during 2022-23 inched up year, with the weighted average maturity declining to 16.05 years from 17.0 years. States raised gross market borrowings of `7.58 lakh crore in 2022-23 as against the total sanctioned amount of `8.81 lakh crore. Note: The data pertains to 24 states/UTs. Sources: CAG; and Budget Documents of State Governments. In the Union Budget 2023-24, gross and net market borrowings were placed at `15.43 lakh crore and `11.81 lakh crore, respectively, an increase of about 8.6 per cent and 6.6 per cent, respectively, over the previous year (Table III.4). In H1:2023-24, gross market borrowings of the central government through dated securities have been planned for about `8.9 lakh crore, constituting 57.6 per cent of total amount budgeted for the year. The Ways and Means Advances (WMA) limit for the central government for H1:2023-24 will be at `1,5 lakh crore for meeting temporary mismatches between receipts and payments. For states/union territories, the WMA limits have been fixed at `47,010 crore with effect from April 1, 2022, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advances to State Governments (Chairman: Shri Sudhir Shrivastava). Amidst protracted geopolitical frictions and slowing global demand, merchandise exports contracted during H2:2022-23. Merchandise imports registered a deceleration in growth during Q3 and contracted in Q4 (upto February) owing to a slowdown in export- related demand as well as a reduction in commodity prices (Chart III.14). The drag from net exports, however, declined in Q3 from the previous quarter, reflecting continued strength in services exports. exports growth (Chart III.15). The share of petroleum products in total merchandise exports rose to 20.3 per cent during H2:2022-23 (October-February) from 16.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Merchandise import growth moderated to 1.9 per cent in H2:2022-23 (October-February) to reach US$ 280.7 billion. Oil imports rose while gold imports declined as retail demand remained sluggish amidst higher prices. The deceleration in non-oil non-gold imports was driven by electronics goods, pearls and precious stones, chemicals and silver (Chart III.16). The merchandise trade deficit in H2 (October-February) widened to US$ 106.6 billion from US$ 96.3 billion during the corresponding period of the previous year. During H2:2022-23 (October-February), exports of engineering goods, cotton yarn, gems and jewellery, plastic and linoleum, and chemicals declined, while petroleum products, electronics, rice, oil meals and iron ore contributed positively to overall merchandise Services sector trade sustained its post-pandemic buoyancy reflecting strong global demand for Indian services (Chart III.17). Services exports grew by 24.5 per cent in Q3 and 29.2 per cent in Q4 (up to February) on top of 30.2 per cent growth in Q2, propelled by software, business, financial and travel services. Inward remittances exhibited resilience with a y-o-y growth of 31.7 per cent to reach US$ 30.8 billion in Q3. The current account deficit narrowed to 2.2 per cent of GDP in Q3 from 3.7 per cent in Q2, mirroring the trend in merchandise trade deficit. Turning to the financial account, capital flows ebbed in H2:2022-23. Net FDI dropped to US$ 2.1 billion in Q3 from US$ 4.6 billion a year ago, owing to lower inflows and higher outward FDI (Chart III.18). During April- January 2022-23, manufacturing, financial services and computer services together accounted for more than half of total FDI inflows. The top sources for FDI inflows were Singapore, Mauritius, USA and UAE. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) turned optimistic in Q3, with net purchases of US$ 4.5 billion. They were net sellers during Q4 with net outflows of US$ 2.2 billion, mainly on account of equity segment following heightened uncertainty over monetary policy spillovers and geopolitical concerns. External commercial borrowings (ECBs) recorded net outflows of US$ 6.4 billion during 2022-23 (up to February 2023) due to lower inflows and higher principal repayments. ECBs amounting to US$ 22.8 billion were approved during 2022-23 (April-February) for inter alia on-lending/sub-lending, new projects, refinancing of earlier ECBs, sourcing of capital goods billion during April-January 2022-23 from US$ 2.7 billion during the same period last year, aided by the RBI\u2019s July 2022 measures to attract such flows. As on March 31, 2023, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stood at USD 578.4 billion, equivalent to 9.8 months of projected merchandise imports in 2022-23 or 94.4 per cent of outstanding external debt at end-December 2022.

Net inflows under non-resident deposit accounts rose to US$ 6.0 Aggregate supply \u2013 measured by real gross value added (GVA) at basic prices \u2013 expanded by 4.6 per cent (y-o-y) in Q3:2022-23 (4.7 per cent a year ago), surpassing its pre-pandemic level of Q3:2019-20 by 12.6 per cent (Table III.5). While agriculture and services sectors remained resilient, the manufacturing sector contracted amidst sustained input cost pressures. The momentum of overall GVA, measured by q-o-q saar, recorded double digit growth in Q3 (Chart III.19). Notes: FRE: First revised estimates; SAE: Second advance estimates; #: Implicit.

GVA in agriculture, forestry and fishing posted a growth of 4.0 per cent in H2:2022-23 (3.1 per cent a year ago), even as kharif production was dented by below normal rainfall in key rice producing states and excess rains during the harvesting stage. Replenished reservoir levels and improved soil moisture helped rabi acreage to increase by 3.3 per cent in 2022-23 over the previous year. The overall procurement of rice at 492.2 lakh tonnes during kharif marketing season 2022-23 was 2.2 per cent lower than that in the previous year. Foodgrains buffer stocks were 443.2 lakh tonnes for rice (5.8 times Foodgrains production touched a new record in 2022- 23. The production of pulses rose by 1.9 per cent in 2022-23, primarily on account of gram, moong and other rabi pulses. Among commercial crops, oilseeds and sugarcane achieved record production levels in 2022-23 (Table III.6). Allied activities \u2013 livestock, forestry and fishing \u2013 with a share of about 45 per cent of the agricultural GVA \u2013 contributed almost three-fourth of agricultural GVA growth in 2021-22 (Chart III.20). the norm) and 100.6 lakh tonnes for wheat (0.7 times the norm) as on March 16, 2023.

Industrial activity remained sluggish in Q3, driven decelerated pace (Chart III.22). Mining activity got a boost from coal production, which outweighed trailers and semi-trailers, machinery and equipment, and other non-metallic mineral products recorded expansion. In terms of the use-based classification, infrastructure/construction capital goods expanded at a healthy pace during Q3 and January, while consumer durables output contracted (Chart III.23). Growth in core infrastructure output accelerated from 4.5 per cent in Q3 to 7.5 per cent in Q4 (upto February). Industrial activity improved in Q4. Electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services recorded a The index of industrial production (IIP) grew by 2.6 per cent in Q3:2022-23 and 5.2 per cent in January as compared with 1.6 per cent in Q2, supported by electricity and mining. It was weighed down by manufacturing sector activity, which expanded by 1.1 per cent in Q3 and 3.7 per cent in January. The labour- intensive sectors such as textiles, wearing apparel, leather and related products, and electrical equipment contracted in Q3, while basic metals, motor vehicles, Electricity generation rose by 7.9 per cent (y-o-y) in Q3:2022-23 (18.2 per cent above the pre- pandemic generation level). Thermal power increased by 7.3 per cent in Q3 and contributed 75.8 per cent of total generation. Renewable energy sources (share of 11.5 per cent in total generation) expanded by 22.9 per cent. In Q4 (up to February), electricity generation growth accelerated to 10.1 per cent (Chart III.24a).

The output of manufacturing, primary goods, infrastructure and construction, capital goods and consumer non-durables sectors has surpassed their pre-pandemic levels, while that of consumer durable goods is still trailing. Amongst the major sub-sectors, steel production, cement production, electricity generation, and production of passenger vehicles and tractors are ruling above their 2019-20 levels, while two-wheelers and three-wheelers production is lagging (Table III.8).

Private services slowed down be supported by improving rural demand, the Domestic economic activity exhibited resilience in H2:2022-23, amidst accentuating global headwinds. Investment activity was robust while private consumption growth moderated. On the supply side, services sector was the main driver, with elevated input cost pressures dragging down the manufacturing sector. Going ahead, the economic activity would Government\u2019s thrust on and moderating and slowing external demand are the key risks to the Domestic financial markets evolved in an orderly manner during H2:2022-23 amidst policy repo rate hikes, moderating liquidity and recurrent bouts of global volatility impacting, in particular, equity and forex segments. Bank deposit and lending rates moved higher. Going forward, the RBI will need to remain vigilant in mitigating the impact of global spillovers on domestic financial markets. Since the September 2022 MPR, global financial markets have remained volatile amidst protracted geopolitical tensions, inflation remaining well above target across economies and aggressive monetary tightening. Sovereign bond yields fluctuated widely in line with incoming data and high intensity banking turmoil events in March. Equity markets in advanced economies (AEs) rallied on expectations of monetary policy pivots towards less restrictive stances, with EME stocks mirroring global sentiments, until the collapse of a few banks in the US triggered a flight to safety. In the currency markets, the US dollar eased from a two-decade peak and weakened against most currencies during October 2022-January 2023 but gained in February on strong US data. Volatility impacted EME currencies in an environment of risk aversion, safe haven demand, and correction in global equity markets. Money market rates firmed up across maturities during H2:2022-23, mirroring the increases in the policy repo rate and the ebbing of surplus liquidity. Reflecting these developments, the weighted average call money rate (WACR), on an average, was broadly aligned with the repo rate \u2013 3 basis points (bps) above the repo rate in H2 as compared with 27 bps below in H1 (Chart IV.1). In the overnight call money segment, the weighted average rate (WAR) on traded deals (on an average) was 5 bps above the policy repo rate while it was 15 bps below on reported deals1 during H2 (Chart IV.2a). The average monthly volume of traded deals during In contrast, domestic financial markets evolved in an orderly manner. Money market interest rates hardened during H2:2022-23, while bond yields were largely range-bound. Equity markets exhibited two-way movements in H2. The Indian rupee (INR) depreciated vis-a-vis the US dollar. Bank deposit and lending rates moved higher in response to monetary policy actions. Bank credit growth remained in double digits throughout 2022-23 although it showed signs of slowdown from December 2022. \u2018Traded deals\u2019 are negotiated directly on the NDS-Call platform whereas \u2018reported deals\u2019 are over the counter (OTC) deals which are reported on the H2 at `2.32 lakh crore was notably higher than `0.24 lakh crore in the reported segment (Chart IV.2b). The share of reported deals in the total call money market volume declined to 5 per cent in March 2023 from 33 per cent in September 2022 due inter alia to the Reserve Bank\u2019s directive to all eligible call money participants (including cooperative banks) to obtain NDS-CALL membership, the restoration of regular market hours and tightening liquidity conditions. in TREPS and market repo declined to 61 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively, in H2 from 65 per cent and 19 per cent, in H1. The interest rates on longer-term money market instruments \u2013 3-month T-bills (TBs); certificates of deposit (CDs); and commercial paper (CPs) \u2013 rose in sync with the policy rate. The spread of TBs over Within the money market, the collateralised segments remained dominant. The share of the uncollateralised call money market in total money market volume was 2 per cent in H2. Amongst the collateralised segments, the share of triparty repo (TREPS) moderated to 71 per cent in H2 from 76 per cent a year ago, while that of market repo increased to 27 per cent from 22 per cent (Chart IV.3). Among investors, the share of mutual funds (MFs) \u2013 the major lenders in the collateralised segment \u2013 declined to 67 per cent in H2 from 71 per cent in H1 in the TREPS segment and to 40 per cent from 45 per cent in the market repo segment, mainly because of reduced inflows under debt funds. On the borrowing side, the share of public sector banks (PSBs) the policy repo rate at 30 bps in H2 was marginally higher than 25 bps in H1, while the spreads of CDs and CPs widened to 85 bps and 99 bps, respectively, from 46 bps and 63 bps, amidst receding surplus in risk premia2 during H2 liquidity and rise (Chart IV.4). Banks continued to rely on CDs for funding, with issuances of `3.8 lakh crore in H2 (up to March 24, 2023) on top of `3.0 lakh crore in H1. Resource mobilisation through CPs tapered from `7.3 lakh crore in H1 to `6.4 lakh crore in H2, revealing a preference for bank credit. The weighted average discount rate (WADR) on CP issuances firmed up to 7.21 per cent in H2 from 5.53 per cent in H1 (Chart IV.5a). Corporates remained the major issuers of CPs, although their share declined to 42 per cent in H2 from 52 per cent in H1 (Chart IV.5b). September. They moderated in November, taking cues from softening US yields with a lower-than-expected US CPI print and declining crude prices. Overall, the 10-year benchmark yield softened by 7 bps in Q3 to close at 7.33 per cent. In Q4, yields softened in early February on a lower than anticipated market borrowing programme of the central government for 2023-24. They hardened subsequently on higher domestic and US inflation prints and stronger US economic data. In March, the yields softened, taking cues from US yields following bank collapses which drove investors to safe assets. Overall, the 10-year benchmark yield fell by 3 bps to 7.31 per cent at end-March 2023. The yields on T-bills firmed up across tenors in sync with the policy repo rate increases and moderation in surplus liquidity (Chart IV.7). The CP issuances were dominated by 31-90 days maturity segment with a share of about 49 per cent in H2 as against 33 per cent a year ago (Table IV.1). During H2, G-sec yields were largely range-bound (Chart IV.6). Yields hardened in October 2022, tracking higher than expected domestic CPI inflation for The trading volume in G-secs increased in H2 compared to the corresponding period of 2021-22 while it declined for T-bills over the same period (Chart IV.8). The weighted average yield on traded maturities for G-sec and T-bills increased by 107 bps and 293 bps, respectively, in H2 from their corresponding levels in H2 of the previous year. The overall dynamics of the yield curve are captured by its level, slope, and curvature3. During H2, the average level of yields softened by 11 bps while the slope flattened by 70 bps due to relatively higher increase in short-term rates consequent upon policy tightening, mirroring global movements. The curvature declined by 66 bps in response to yields hardening less in the mid-segment of the curve than in the short and long segments (Chart IV.9). In the Indian context, the level and curvature of the yield curve have more information 3 The level is the average of par yields of all tenors up to 30-years published by FBIL and the slope (term spread) is the difference in par yields of 3-months and 30-year maturities. The curvature is calculated as twice the 14-year yield minus the sum of 30-year and 3-month yields. In line with the announcement in the Union Budget for 2022-23, the Reserve Bank issued Sovereign Green Bonds (SGrBs) amounting to `16,000 crore in two tranches of `8,000 crore each on January 25 and February 9, 2023. The proceeds are to be used exclusively for financing or re-financing new and/or existing projects compatible with the environment and/or climate. To facilitate debt consolidation, the Reserve Bank conducted five switch auctions on behalf of the Central Government amounting to `49,387 crore during H2. The weighted average maturity (WAM) of the outstanding stock of G-secs at 11.94 years during H2 was similar to 11.96 years at end-September 2022. The weighted average coupon (WAC) at 7.26 per cent at end-March 2023 was higher than 7.15 per cent at end-September 2022. The weighted average spread of cut-off yields on state government securities (SGS) over G-sec yields of comparable maturities was 30 bps in H2 (Chart IV.10). The average inter-state spread on securities of 10-year tenor (fresh issuances) was 4 bps in H2. The increase in risk premia was seen across tenors (albeit more at shorter segments) and rating spectrum (Table IV.2). The average 3-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads for State Bank of India\u2019s paper trading overseas reduced by three bps while that of ICICI Bank moderated by four bps in H2 over H1. Corporate bond yields and spreads moved higher during H2, in sync with G-sec yields. The average yield on AAA-rated 3-year bonds issued by non- banking financial companies (NBFCs) and corporates increased by 57 bps (to 8.12 per cent) and by 49 bps (to 8.07 per cent), respectively, in March 2023 over September 2022. The average yield on issuances by public sector undertakings (PSUs), financial institutions (FIs) and banks rose by 46 bps to 7.75 per cent (Chart IV.11a). The risk premium (measured by the spread over 3-year G-sec yields) increased from The primary market issuances of corporate bonds increased to `3.9 lakh crore during H2 (up to February 2023) from `2.5 lakh crore during the corresponding period of 2021-22, offsetting the moderation in overseas issuances from `0.5 lakh crore in H2:2021- 22 to `0.1 lakh crore in H2:2022-23 (Chart IV.12a). Banks tapped the bond market to raise capital for their rapidly expanding balance sheets, driven by the surge in credit demand (Chart IV.12b). Nearly the entire resource mobilisation in the corporate bond market (98.7 per cent) was through the private placement Note: Data are monthly averages for spreads over G-secs.

The outstanding investments by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) in corporate bonds declined marginally from `1.14 lakh crore at end-September 2022 to `1.04 lakh crore at end-March 2023, pulling down the utilisation of the approved limits from 17.9 per cent to 15.5 per cent (Chart IV.12c). The daily average secondary market trading volume during H2 (up to February 2023) at `5,332 crore was 7.7 per In H2, domestic equity markets began on a positive note, amidst strong buying by FPIs and robust touched an all-time high of 63,284 on December 1, 2022.

Barring brief phases of turbulence, equity market volatility trended downwards with the India VIX \u2013 which captures the short-term expected volatility of Nifty 50 \u2013 declining from 20 at end-September 2022 to 12.9 at end-March 2023 (Chart IV.13a).

Foreign investors turned net buyers the other hand, were net buyers amidst steady retail FPI flows to EMEs rebounded during H2 (Chart IV.14a). In India, foreign investors were net buyers in the domestic equity market in October-November 2022, (SIP) route, enabling the market to remain resilient. FPIs and DIIs were net buyers to the tune of `25,027 crore and `1.10 lakh crore, respectively, in H2 (Chart IV.14b). Activity in the domestic primary market remained subdued in H2, with issuers reconsidering IPOs amidst volatile market conditions (Chart IV.14c). c: Amount Raised through IPOs/ FPOs The appreciation of the US dollar, triggered by aggressive rate hikes and the hawkish stance of the US Fed, exerted depreciation pressure on EME currencies in H2 (Chart IV.15a). Buffeted by these global spillovers, the INR touched an all-time low of 83.2 per US$ on October 20, 2022. It recovered in November 2022, riding on a depreciating US dollar and net inflows through foreign portfolio investments. Since then, it has remained largely range-bound. The INR volatility \u2013 measured by the 1-month at the money (ATM) option implied volatility \u2013 increased marginally from 5.29 per cent during H1 to 5.33 per cent during H2 (Chart IV.15b). In terms of the 40-currency nominal and real effective exchange rate, the INR depreciated by 4.2 per cent and On a financial year basis, the INR outperformed major EME currencies, including the Argentine Peso, the South African Rand, and the Turkish Lira during 2022-23 (Chart IV.16). Bank credit growth remained robust in H2:2022-23 in tandem with economic activity. Growth in non- food bank credit accelerated to 15.4 per cent (y-o-y) as at end-March 2023 from 9.7 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.18). With credit growth outpacing growth in aggregate deposits, the incremental credit deposit ratio was above 100 per cent, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of high credit growth (Box IV.1). Forward premiums fell during H2 \u2013 the 1-month forward premia declined to an average of 2.39 per cent during H2 from 3.38 per cent during H1 (Chart IV.17). While credit growth picked up across the board, it remained higher for private sector banks (PVBs) (18.4 per cent) vis-\u00e0-vis the PSBs (13.7 per cent) (Chart IV.19a). PSBs were, however, the major driver of the incremental credit extended by all scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) in 2022-23 (Chart IV.19b). Credit offtake was led by personal loans and services6. While the share of personal loans in incremental 6 While overall bank credit and non-food credit data are based on Section-42 return (which covers all SCBs), sectoral non-food credit data are based on sector-wise and industry-wise bank credit (SIBC) return, which covers select banks accounting for about 93 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all SCBs. Bank credit growth reflects factors such as swings in economic activity, the availability and cost of non-bank funding, the relative cost of bank funding, the banking sector\u2019s health and risk appetite. Bank credit growth during 2022-23 was in large part a cyclical rebound from the subdued profile during the pre-pandemic year (2019- 20) and the pandemic phase (2020-21 and 2021-22). While deposit growth trailed credit growth in 2022-23, the position was the reverse in the previous two years, reflecting higher savings due to reduced spending on contact-intensive services. More recently, deposit growth has accelerated, partly boosted by higher deposit rates. bank deposits and credit are cointegrated, i.e., they co- move over time7. The long-run elasticity of credit with respect to deposits is 0.94, attesting to this high degree of co-movement. The error correction coefficient is (-)0.08 (and highly statistically significant with z-statistic of -3.94), which indicates that around 8 per cent of any divergence between credit and deposit growth is eliminated every month. Despite the buoyancy in bank credit in 2022-23, the credit-to-GDP gap remains negative (Chart IV.1.1). Overall, the credit growth is driven by a rebound in economic activity and is supported by an improvement in deposit growth. An econometric analysis of monthly non-food credit and deposit data of all scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) for the period April 2007-December 2022 shows that credit offtake declined vis-\u00e0-vis the previous year, the share of the services sector nearly doubled in February 2023 (Chart IV.20). year ago, driven by large industries, especially metals, petroleum, and chemical industries. Credit growth to the infrastructure sector decelerated on the back of Sector-wise, growth in agriculture credit accelerated to 14.9 per cent (y-o-y) in February 2023 from 10.3 per cent a year ago. Bank credit to industry rose by 7.0 per cent in February 2023 as compared with 6.7 per cent a credit growth remained buoyant, shored up by the extended till March 2023 (Chart IV.21). 7 The vector error correction model includes eight lags, based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Johansen\u2019s test confirms the presence of one cointegrating vector. The regression diagnostics are satisfactory. R2 for the short-run equation is 0.70. The Lagrange multiplier (LM) test for autocorrelation in the residuals confirms no autocorrelation up to lag 12. Services sector credit gained further traction in H2, propelled by flows to NBFCs, both housing finance companies and others NBFCs. With wholesale and retail trade included under the MSME category and easier access to loans under the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE), credit to the trade sector registered accelerated growth Retail loans remained the prime contributor to to the housing sector recorded consistent expansion, vehicle loan growth strengthened further. Credit card loan growth was in high double digits throughout 2022-23 reflecting pent-up consumption demand (Chart IV.23). b: Bank Credit to NBFCs Banks\u2019 non-SLR investments \u2013 i.e., investments in CPs, corporates \u2013 were lower during H2 than a year ago, as banks preferred to support the commercial sector in adjusted non-food credit (i.e., non-food bank credit and non-SLR investments taken together) accelerated a year ago, driven by non-food credit (Chart IV.25b). securities by banks moderated to 8.5 per cent of 2022 as banks funded credit demand by shedding excess investments (Chart IV.26). Excess SLR holdings provide collateral buffers to banks for availing funds The asset quality of SCBs improved during 2022-23, with the overall non-performing assets (NPA) ratio declining to 4.5 per cent in December 2022 from 6.5 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.24a). Asset quality improved across all the major sectors over the same period (Chart IV.24b). under the LAF and are also a component of the to deposit and lending rates of banks strengthened in H2:2022-23, reflecting the combined impact of the external benchmark regime for loans, the moderation in surplus liquidity in the banking system and credit growth persisting above deposit growth. Banks revised upwards their external benchmark-based lending rates (EBLRs) by 250 bps during May 2022- March 2023 in tandem with the increase in the policy repo rate. The marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) \u2013 the internal benchmark for loan pricing \u2013 rose by 140 bps over the same period. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on sanctioned fresh rupee loans increased by 173 bps and that on outstanding rupee loans by 95 bps during May 2022 to February 2023 (Table IV.4). The external benchmark linked loans now dominate outstanding floating rate loans, with their share in total increasing from 44.0 per cent in March 2022 to 48.3 per cent in December 2022. Correspondingly, the share of MCLR-linked loans declined from 48.6 per cent to 46.1 per cent over the same period (Table IV.5). Within EBLR loans, the RBI\u2019s repo rate is the preferred benchmark, with a share of 81 per cent of all EBLR linked loans at end-December 2022. The significant increase in the share of repo linked loans with shorter reset periods aided the pace of transmission to WALR on outstanding loans. Across domestic banks, the increase in the WALRs on fresh rupee loans was higher in the case of PSBs than PVBs during May 2022 to February 2023 (Chart IV.27a). The lending rates of PVBs remained higher than those of PSBs (Chart IV.27b). The transmission to lending and deposit rates was the maximum in the case of foreign banks, reflecting a higher share of low cost and lower duration wholesale deposits in their total liabilities, which facilitates faster adjustment in interest rates. Base rate regime MCLR regime External benchmark regime Others Note: Data pertain to 74 scheduled commercial banks. Source: RBI. The WALRs increased across all the sectors during May 2022-February 2023 (Chart IV.28). The transmission to retail deposit rates gathered pace in H2 after remaining subdued in H1 as banks The spreads charged by domestic banks over the policy repo rate (in the case of floating rate fresh rupee loans where the repo rate is the external benchmark) moderated for personal and MSME loans during H2:2022-23 (Table IV.6). intensified their efforts to garner retail deposits to fresh deposits (including retail and bulk) increased by banks had focussed on mobilising bulk deposits.

Interest rates on small savings instruments (SSIs) \u2013 administered by the government and linked to secondary market yields on G-secs of comparable maturities \u2013 were revised upwards by 10-30 bps for Q3:2022-23, 20-110 bps for Q4:2022-23 and 10-70 bps for Q1:2023-24 after being left unchanged for nine consecutive quarters, i.e., from Q2:2020-21 to Q2:2022-23. With these adjustments, rates on most of the SSIs are closely aligned with the formula-based rates (Table IV.7).

Amidst waning surplus liquidity, the Reserve Bank conducted two variable rate repo (VRR) main operation auctions in February-March and one fine-tuning VRR in March 2023. The Reserve Bank remained committed to meeting the productive requirements of the economy, with flexibility on conducting operations on either side of the LAF, depending on evolving liquidity conditions. The standing deposit facility (SDF), which has been operational over the past year as the floor of the LAF corridor, allowed the RBI to seamlessly absorb the surplus liquidity without being constrained by the availability of collateral. Currency in circulation (CiC) was the key driver of liquidity drainage during H2. CiC expanded by `2.2 lakh crore during H2 (up to March 24, 2023), driven by festival season demand (Table IV.8). This was partly offset by the net forex purchases (`0.5 lakh crore) and the pick up in government spending (`0.3 lakh crore). Banks drew down their excess CRR holdings (`0.4 lakh crore) which also augmented liquidity. In terms of the management of liquidity, OMO sales and the increase in cash reserve balances (due to higher reserve base) sucked out liquidity from the system during H2:2022-23. Net average daily absorptions under the LAF moderated to `0.4 lakh crore during H2 from `3.3 lakh crore during H1 (Chart IV.32a). The net LAF slipped occasionally into deficit mode in H2, triggered by frictional pressures from festival-related currency demand, month-end GST outflows and quarterly advance tax payments. In this regard, net LAF injections increased to `1.05 lakh crore on March 17, 2023 \u2013 the highest since April 24, 2019 (`1.42 lakh crore). Amidst waninig liquidity surplus, the amounts absorbed under the variable reverse repo rate (VRRR) auctions fell in H2; the average offer-cover ratio of the auctions was 0.26 was in H2 as compared with 0.40 in H1. Moreover, banks also took greater recourse to the marginal standing facility (MSF), with daily average borrowings of `8,438 crore during H2 as compared with `3,448 crore during H1 (Chart IV.32b). During 2022-23, MSF borrowings touched a high of `65,646 crore on October 24, 2022. The increased access to the MSF window, even as large surplus funds were placed under the SDF, reflected skewed liquidity distribution within the banking system. To meet liquidity requirements, the RBI conducted 14-day VRR auctions on February 10 and March 10, 2023 and a fine-tuning 5-day VRR auction on March 24. An amount of `5,000 crore was also made available to standalone primary dealers (SPDs) under the standing liquidity facility (SLF) on March 31, 2023 at the prevailing repo rate, with funds availed under this facility repayable on or before April 5, 2023. round impact of the change in the CRR as against 10.3 per cent at end-March 2022). Money supply (M3) With the periodic policy rate hikes accompanied by the progressive normalisation of surplus liquidity, the WACR was closely aligned with the repo rate in H2 in contrast to H1 when surplus liquidity conditions had kept the WACR below the repo rate (Chart IV.33).

With a view to enabling banks to better manage their investment portfolios, the dispensation of the enhanced held to maturity (HTM) limit of 23 per cent was extended by one year from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024. Banks were also allowed to include securities acquired between September 1, 2020 and March 31, 2024 in the enhanced HTM limit. The Domestic financial market conditions adjusted in H2:2022-23 to monetary tightening and ebbing liquidity while exhibiting resilience to global policy spillovers. Market rates firmed up at varying degrees across segments, instruments, and maturity spectrum. Bank credit offtake remained buoyant on resilient economic activity. Bank lending and deposit rates rose in tandem with monetary policy actions. The INR depreciated reflecting the strengthening US dollar and portfolio outflows. Going forward, the RBI will remain vigilant, agile, and nimble in its liquidity management operations to meet the productive requirements of the economy while mitigating the impact of global spillovers on domestic financial markets. The global economy is slowing under the impact of tighter financial conditions, high inflation, and the lingering conflict in Ukraine. Global financial markets have exhibited heightened volatility in response to the evolving inflation and financial stability developments, in particular, recent banking sector stress. Food and energy insecurity, financial stability concerns and risks of debt distress pose downside risks to the outlook for emerging market and developing economies. The global economy is slowing under the impact of tighter financial conditions, high inflation, and the lingering conflict in Ukraine. Consumer price inflation is ruling well above targets and is exhibiting persistence. In March, global financial markets were rattled by the failures/bailouts in the banking space which triggered extreme risk aversion, meltdowns, and flight to safety. Sovereign bond yields exhibited sizeable movements over the past six months \u2013 easing during November-January on expectations of less aggressive monetary tightening over softer inflation prints; hardening in February 2023 on stickier inflation and strong labour market conditions; and crashes across maturities in March on banking and financial stability concerns. Short-term yields recorded the sharpest single-day decline in decades in March. The US dollar weakened until January 2023, but it appreciated in February 2023. Global equity markets remained cautious with an upward bias up to February, with sharp corrections in mid-March. Looking ahead, food and energy insecurity, financial stability concerns and risks of debt distress pose downside risks to the outlook for emerging market and developing economies. supply bottlenecks and sharp corrections in energy prices. High frequency indicators for Q1:2023 point to an easing of the downturn in manufacturing and an uptick in service sector activity. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) update of January 2023 revised up global growth projections for 2022 and 2023 by 20 basis points (bps) each to 3.4 per cent and 2.9 per cent, respectively1. Emerging out of two quarters of sequential contraction, the US economy grew by 3.2 per cent (quarter-on- quarter, seasonally adjusted annualised rates (q-o-q, saar)) in Q3:2022 and 2.6 per cent in Q4 (Table V.1). The improvement was driven by private inventory investment, consumer spending, non-residential fixed investment, government spending and exports. The labour market recorded strong gains, with the unemployment rate at a multi-decade low. Nominal wage growth was robust, albeit with some slowing down more recently. The US composite S&P Global Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI2) at 50.1 in February 2023 signalled an end of a seven-month sequence of contraction. In H2:2022, global growth was stronger than anticipated, reflecting pent-up demand, accumulated household savings, labour market gains, easing After growing by 1.5 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q3, real GDP in the Euro area stagnated in Q4 due to a decline in private consumption and investment, reeling under high inflation, tightening financial conditions and geopolitical tensions. The Eurozone composite 1 The OECD in its Interim Economic Outlook (March 2023) revised up global growth forecasts for 2023 and 2024 to 2.6 per cent and 2.9 per cent, respectively, from the November 2022 projections of 2.2 per cent and 2.7 per cent. 2 The references to PMIs are to S&P Global indices, unless specified otherwise. Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualised rate (q-o-q, saar) real household incomes due to elevated energy and goods prices weighed on consumer spending. The labour market remains tight with strong wage growth and a low unemployment rate. The UK composite PMI at 52.2 in March remained in expansion territory for the second consecutive month reflecting higher levels of business activity in both the manufacturing and the service sector. Japan\u2019s GDP contracted by 1.1 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q3:2022, and the economy averted a recession with a meagre growth of 0.1 per cent in Q4 as a weak yen and higher import costs hurt consumption and businesses. The composite PMI (au Jibun Bank) rose from 48.9 in November, the lowest reading in H2:2022, to 52.9 in March registering the sharpest uptick since June 2022 driven by services activity, even as manufacturing sector remained subdued.

Amongst EMEs, China's GDP growth rebounded to 3.9 per cent (year-on-year, y-o-y) in Q3:2022 from 0.4 per cent in Q2, supported by policy interventions and an easing of COVID-19 lockdowns (Table V.1). Growth decelerated to 2.9 per cent (y-o-y) in Q4 due to re-emergence of COVID-19 infections and lockdowns, dragging down the annual growth for 2022 to 3.0 per cent \u2013 below the target of 5.5 per cent (Table V.2). The composite PMI (Caixin) rose to 54.2 in February, supported by both manufacturing and services activity. In March, however, manufacturing PMI slowed to the neutral level of 50 signalling stable business conditions at the end of Q1:2023. The real GDP growth target for 2023 has been fixed at around 5 per cent, the lowest in more than three decades. PMI rose for the third consecutive month to 53.7 in March from the near two-year low in October 2022 driven by services sector. The unemployment rate fell to 6.6 per cent in February 2023 from 6.7 per cent in December 2022. In the UK, GDP contracted by 0.4 per cent in Q3:2022 (q-o-q, saar) and rose by 0.5 per cent in Q4.

The South African economy grew by 1.8 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q3:2022 and contracted by 1.3 per cent in Q4. In y-o-y terms, the economy grew by 4.2 per cent in Q3 and by 0.9 per cent in Q4. In Q1:2023, the composite PMI at 50.5 in February indicated a return to an expansion in output, after falling to a 13-month low of 48.7 in January. The Russian economy contracted by 3.7 per cent (y-o-y) in Q3:2022. The labour market remains tight with unemployment close to its all-time low. The Southeast Asia region recorded a robust growth performance in Q3:2022 on revival of consumption and tourism before decelerating in Q4:2022. The ASEAN3 manufacturing PMI for February pointed to an improvement in operating conditions in the manufacturing sector as expansions in output and new orders gained momentum. Additionally, employment rose for the first time since October. The operating conditions continued to improve in March. Amongst high frequency indicators, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) composite leading indicators (CLIs) for January- February 2023 remained below trend for most economies (Chart V.1a). The global composite PMI at 52.1 in February returned to expansion \u2013 ending a six- month sequence of contraction \u2013 led by the services sector and the first expansion of manufacturing production since July 2022 (Chart V.1b). Manufacturing production continued to expand in March, albeit at a slower pace. Note: For PMI indices a reading above 50 indicates an overall increase compared to the previous month, and below 50 an overall decrease. The indices are seasonally adjusted. Sources: OECD; and Bloomberg. Weakening global demand led to subdued trade volumes, despite an easing of supply chain pressures. Merchandise trade volume declined by 0.3 per cent (y-o-y) in Q4:2022, and by a further 1.5 per cent in January 2023 (Chart V.2a). The Baltic Dry Index, which measures shipping costs for a wide variety of bulk commodities such as coal and iron ore, was 9.3 per cent higher in March 2023 than the pre- COVID average of 2019-20 (Chart V.2b). The goods trade barometer compiled by the WTO fell to 92.2 in December 2022 (96.2 in September), indicating a weakening growth in trade volumes in Q1:2023. The IMF in its WEO update (January 2023) forecast world trade (goods and services) volume growth to decelerate to 2.4 per cent in 2023 from 5.4 per cent in 2022. Global commodity prices remained volatile in Q4:2022 and Q1:2023. They initially increased by 5.4 per cent (in terms of the Bloomberg commodity price index) in the first half of Q4:2022, but continued to soften during the rest of Q4 and Q1:2023, touching January 2022 (the pre-Ukraine war) levels (Chart V.3a). Global food prices, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), eased by 3.1 per cent in Q4:2022 and 1.5 per cent in Q1:2023 (up to February), driven by correction in the prices of meat, vegetable oil and dairy products (Chart V.3b). The prices of cereals moderated marginally whereas sugar prices increased. Crude oil prices softened during Q4 and Q1 but rose in early April following production cut announcement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) amidst continuing volatility. A mild winter, weak industrial activity in Europe, COVID lockdowns in China, and winter blizzards in the US and Canada that disrupted holiday travel led to a contraction (y-o-y) in crude oil demand in Q4:2022 and lower prices (Chart V.3c). Natural gas prices softened significantly \u2013 by 77 per cent between their peak in August 2022 and March 2023 (according to World Bank\u2019s natural gas index) \u2013 on a milder winter in Europe and weaker economic activity (Chart V.3c). Base metal prices edged up over the past six months, in reflecting the weakening US dollar, decline inventories, reopening of the Chinese economy and better-than-anticipated industrial growth in Europe. Gold prices rebounded on retreat of the US dollar from its two-decade high level and safe haven demand amidst a few bank failures in the US. Other metals like copper, aluminium, iron and steel also gained during Q4:2022 and Q1:2023 (Chart V.3d). Consumer price inflation remained elevated across economies due to sustained high core inflation, and cost push pressures from elevated food and energy prices. It has, however, come off from recent peaks due to softening energy prices, easing supply chain bottlenecks, and the unwinding of monetary and fiscal stimulus. The recent softening notwithstanding, headline inflation remains well above target across AEs and EMEs (Table V.3). Core inflation persistence reflects tight labour market and a low unemployment rate, especially for AEs. According to the IMF WEO (January 2023), global is projected to moderate from 8.8 per cent in 2022 to 6.6 per cent in 2023 and 4.3 per cent in 2024 \u2013 still above the pre- pandemic (2017-19) average of 3.5 per cent. In the US, headline CPI inflation receded from its 40- year high of 9.1 per cent in June 2022 to 6.0 per cent in February 2023, driven down by decline in energy and food prices inflation. Over the same period, inflation in terms of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index \u2013 the Federal Reserve (Fed)\u2019s preferred measure of inflation \u2013 moderated from 7.0 per cent to 5.0 per cent (Chart V.4a), while core PCE inflation eased only modestly from 5.0 per cent to 4.6 per cent (Chart V.4b). In the Euro area, CPI inflation (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices or HICP) eased to 6.9 per cent in March 2023 from its peak of 10.6 per cent in October 2022. The underlying measures have, however, hardened over the same period \u2013 core inflation (inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco) Notes: (1) Figures in parentheses for US are y-o-y change in personal (2) The Bank of Canada aims to keep inflation at the 2 per cent mid-point of an inflation control target range of 1-3 per cent.

In the UK, CPI inflation eased to 10.4 per cent in February 2023 from 11.1 per cent in October 2022, on lower price pressures in transport and restaurants and hotels. In Japan, CPI inflation soared to a 41-year high of 4.3 per cent in January 2023 from 3.0 per cent in September 2022, led by fuel, light and water charges4. It moderated to 3.3 per cent in February. 4 CPI inflation in all items less fresh food \u2013 the Bank of Japan\u2019s target measure \u2013 rose to 4.2 per cent in January 2023 from 3.0 per cent in September 2022. It fell to 3.1 per cent in February. Notes: 1. For India, core CPI, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups \u2018food and beverages\u2019 and \u2018fuel and light\u2019 from the headline CPI. Amongst major EMEs, CPI inflation in Brazil moderated to 5.6 per cent in February 2023 from 7.2 per cent in September 2022 (Chart V.4c). In Russia, it eased to 11.0 per cent in February 2023 from 13.7 per cent in September, partly due to currency appreciation. In South Africa, CPI inflation softened to 7.0 per cent in February 2023 from 7.5 per cent in September. In China, headline inflation remained subdued, falling to 1.0 per cent in February 2023 from 2.8 per cent in September, due to weak demand. Core inflation in EMEs remained relatively stickier (Chart V.4d). During Q4:2022 and Q1:2023, central banks pivoted towards smaller rate hikes or a pause from the aggressive pace in the initial part of 2022, recognising that headline inflation is inching down but at a tardy pace and underlying inflation pressures remain relentlessly high. Heightened financial market volatility and financial stability concerns after the bank failures and bailouts have, however, added uncertainty to the future monetary policy trajectory. Starting in March 2022, the US Fed has hiked the target range for federal funds rate in all its subsequent policy meetings to tame inflation. In November 2022, the US Fed effected a 75 bps increase in the target range, its fourth successive 75 bps hike. It slowed the pace of tightening with hikes of 50 bps in December and 25 bps each in February and March 2023. Cumulatively, the US Fed has raised rates by 475 bps in the current tightening phase spread over one year \u2013 the fastest pace since the 1980s. According to the Summary of Economic Projections released in March 2023, the majority of FOMC participants expected the federal funds rate to be in the range of 5.0-5.25 per cent by end-2023. In the wake of turmoil in the banking sector, the US Fed in March announced a new lending facility, the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), to provide banks liquidity to meet the needs of all their depositors. The BTFP offers loans of up to one year against collateral including US Treasuries and other qualifying assets, which will be valued at par. Additionally, the Federal Reserve along with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank announced on March 19, 2023 a coordinated action to enhance the provision of liquidity via the standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap line arrangements. The ECB increased its key rate by 75 bps, its second successive 75 bps hike, in October 20225. It toned down the pace of tightening with 50 bps hikes in December 2022, February and March 2023 each. In its December 2022 policy, the ECB also decided to reduce its asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio from the beginning of March 2023 at a pace of 15 billion per month on average until the end of the second quarter of 2023, with the subsequent pace of decline to be determined over time. It, however, intends to continue reinvesting maturing securities under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) until at least the end of 2024. The Bank of England (BoE) raised its policy rate in the November 2022 meeting by 75 bps, followed by 50 bps in December and February 2023 each and 25 bps in March. The BoE started its gilt sales under \u00a380 billion stock reduction programme on November 1, instead of the initial scheduled start of early October 2022. The postponement was due to the significant volatility in the UK financial markets in September. The BoE also wound down the emergency bond-buying scheme of \u00a319 billion it had launched in September 2022 to restore orderly market conditions. Amongst other major AEs, the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate by 50 bps each in its October 2022 and December meetings, 25 bps in January 2023 and paused in March. After raising its cash rate target by 50 bps in September, the Reserve Bank of Australia scaled down its rate hike size to 25 bps each in its October, November, December 2022, February and March 2023 meetings. The Norges Bank slowed its pace of rate hike to 25 bps starting November 2022 meeting from the 50 bps hikes in its previous meetings. The Bank of Korea paused its rate hike cycle in February 2023 after more than one year of monetary tightening. The Czech National Bank has maintained pause since August 2022 after effecting a cumulative 325 bps rate hike in 2022 (Chart V.5a). The Bank of Japan continued to diverge from the other AEs by maintaining an accommodative stance. It expanded its tolerance range of 10-year Japanese Government bond yield fluctuations from \u00b1 0.25 percentage points to \u00b1 0.5 percentage points in its December 2022 policy meeting. the Banco Central do Brasil Amongst EMEs, maintained its policy rate at 13.75 per cent since the pause in September 2022. The South African Reserve Bank raised its policy rate by 75 bps in November 2022, 25 bps in January 2023 and 50 bps in March (Chart V.5b). The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) and the Bank of Russia (BoR) maintained accommodative stances, after rate cuts in August and September, respectively. The PBoC reduced the required reserve In order to reinforce transmission of policy rates to bank lending conditions and to restore price stability, the ECB in its October meeting decided to: (a) adjust the interest rate applicable to targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) and to index them to the average applicable key ECB interest rates and offered banks early voluntary repayment dates; (b) set the remuneration of minimum reserves at the deposit facility rate instead of remuneration at its main refinancing operations (MRO) rate. of economic activity and expectations relating to the monetary policy path. Since March 10, financial Amongst Asian EMEs, the Bank of Thailand which embarked on the tightening cycle in August 2022 raised rates by 25 bps in all its subsequent meetings. The Bank Indonesia increased its policy rate by 50 bps each in October and November 2022 and by 25 bps each in December 2022 and January 2023, with a pause since February. In Latin America, central banks of Mexico and Colombia slowed their pace of tightening to 25 bps in March 2023, while Chile and Peru have maintained a pause since December 2022 and February 2023, respectively. Among European EMEs, Hungary paused its hiking cycle in October 2022. The central bank of Turkey, on the other hand, cut its key policy rate by 150 bps each in October and November 2022 and by 50 bps in February 2023, even as inflation at 50.5 per cent in March 2023 was well above the target. stability concerns following the collapse of a few banks in the US have imparted sizeable volatility to global financial markets: bond yields crashed; there has been a sharp correction in equity markets; and the expectations of further monetary tightening yielded to pause/rate cuts. In equity markets, the US S&P 500 generally rallied in Fed actions amidst some fall in inflation and strong economic data. In February, the market corrected on concerns of more tightening and rates remaining correction continued in March after bank failures, though it recouped losses by end of the month. Overall, the US S&P index rose by 14.6 per cent Global financial markets witnessed large swings in Q4:2022 and Q1:2023, driven by fluctuating perceptions on the stickiness of inflation, the strength response to bank collapses. The European stock market outperformed the US markets, over waning recessionary concerns and benefitting from the sharp decline in natural gas prices. exerted downward pressures on equities in EMEs EME equities gained around 9 per cent in Q4:2022, similar to developed markets. In Q1:2023, equity markets in AEs rallied sharply vis-\u00e0-vis EME equity markets on expectation of a turn in the US (Chart V.6). Given the prominent role of the US dollar in the have a significant impact on global financial markets In 2022, the US Federal Reserve undertook aggressive monetary tightening, along with forward guidance of \u2018higher for longer\u2019, which impacted financial markets across segments and geographies. US monetary policy surprises can be proxied by the variations in the US overnight index swap rates (OIS) (Lloyd, 2018). Against this backdrop, an interest rate surprise is identified by a change in 3-month OIS rate. Its impact on global equities and bonds markets, both AEs and EMEs, is modelled using daily data as: is the return on equity or bond index (in US$ where is the JP Morgan global FX volatility index terms); to capture global volatility; is the global sentiment index; surprise is the difference of the 3-month OIS from its previous day closing. MSCI world, AE and EME equity indices are used for calculating equity returns for the respective stock markets, respectively, while FTSE Government and FTSE Emerging Markets bond indices are used for calculating returns on bonds. The empirical analysis focuses on the experience during 2022 and indicates that, controlling for volatility and the prevailing global sentiment, an unanticipated US monetary tightening reduces global equity as well as bond returns (Table V.1.1). As regards EMEs, their bond markets turn out to be sensitive to US monetary surprises \u2013 rising interest rate differentials in favour of the US can make EME debt assets less attractive and depress portfolio inflows.

Yields, however, raced up in December 2022, with the BoJ\u2019s expansion of its tolerance range for 10-year Japanese Government bond yield fluctuations to \u00b1 0.5 percentage points. In Q1:2023, moderating inflation across countries led to softening of yields in January. b: Portfolio Flows to EMEs Yields, however, moved sharply higher in February on data showing sticky inflation and robust US retail sales and non-farm payroll gains. Yields fell precipitously in March as investors panicked and rushed towards safer assets amidst financial market turbulence caused by bank failures (Chart V.7a). The yield curve remained inverted in Q4 and Q1 over recession concerns and expectations of a turn in the monetary policy cycle. UK and German 10-year bond yields tracked the US markets. The Japanese bond yields remained range- bound, reflecting the yield curve control policy of the BoJ, barring the upward adjustment in the tolerance range in December. Bond yields in EMEs exhibited two-way movements, with a hardening bias driven by domestic monetary tightening as well as global cues (Chart V.7b). Chinese bond yields firmed up modestly despite monetary accommodation. In the currency markets, the US dollar reversed its rally in October \u2013 after hitting a two-decade high in September 2022 \u2013 on perceptions of the Fed stepping down from its aggressive policy tightening (Chart V.8a). However, tight labour market conditions and stronger-than-expected inflation data led the market to assess that the tightening cycle may last longer, strengthening the greenback in February. The US dollar treaded down in March on financial stability concerns and expectations that the Fed may be forced to reverse its tightening cycle. The US dollar dynamics were mirrored in the EME currencies, with the volatility exacerbated by capital outflows (Chart V.8b). The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index gained 4.3 per cent in Q4:2022 and 1.9 per cent in Q1:2023. The risks to the global growth outlook are tilted to the downside. The recent financial stability risks and global spillovers have imparted significant uncertainty to the economic outlook, as policymakers juggle between sticky inflation on the one hand and financial stability risks on the other. These developments are imparting sizeable volatility to global financial markets and generating large adverse spillovers on to emerging market economies through volatility in capital flows, currency movements and bond yields, posing downside risks to their growth prospects. ", "file6": "Aggregate supply conditions are improving. This augurs well for demand ahead of the festival season. Consumer price inflation is ruling above the upper threshold around the target. Monetary policy has moved into the withdrawal of accommodation mode and remains focussed to ensure that inflation returns to the target while supporting growth. The daunting global environment imparts considerable uncertainty to the outlook. Since the release of the April 2022 Monetary Policy Report (MPR), the global economic environment has been marked by slowing growth with rising risks of recession, elevated inflationary pressures, and tightening financial conditions engendered by aggressive and synchronised monetary policy actions and stances. For emerging market economies (EMEs), these developments have translated into currency depreciations brought on by a surging US dollar and capital outflows, leading to reserve losses. The conflict in Ukraine lingers on and the pandemic continues to weigh on economic activity even as issues in green transition, real and financial fragmentation, trade restrictions and reshoring pose formidable challenges to the global economy. Financial markets remain volatile and global spillovers pose significant headwinds. sharply by 21 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively, since end-March (upto September 27, 2022) amidst high volatility. In currency markets, the US dollar has strengthened to a 20-year high while all other major currencies have depreciated. Turning to the domestic economy, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 13.5 per cent (y-o-y) in Q1: 2022-23, driven by base effects, even as momentum slipped due to the drag from net exports and restrained government spending. Aggregate supply conditions have been steadily improving and this augurs well for demand, both urban and rural, ahead of the festival season. The late pick-up in south-west monsoon and the recent spread of it to deficient regions is enabling a catch-up in kharif sowing, though paddy and pulses remain undersown relative to a year ago. Manufacturing is steadily gaining strength and services are posting strong growth, led by contact-sensitive sectors. Brent crude prices remain at elevated levels, given the tight demand-supply balance, despite recent correction. Global food prices have declined by 14 per cent from an all-time high in March but are ruling 8 per cent over last year\u2019s level1. The Bloomberg commodity index was 10 per cent higher on September 27 (year-on-year (y-o-y) basis), notwithstanding some easing since June. Sovereign bond yields have hardened and reached multi-year highs in major advanced economies (AEs) as investors brace for the future course of monetary policy across the world. Yield curves have inverted, foretelling future recession. Equity markets in AEs and EMEs corrected Inflationary pressures, however, persisted at elevated levels during H1:2022-23 and remain a key policy concern. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation has been at or above the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent since January 2022, driven by adverse supply shocks emanating from geopolitical tensions. While inflation has eased from its April peak of 7.8 per cent, it remains at unacceptably high levels. In order to anchor inflationary expectations and contain the second round effects, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) narrowed the policy corridor in April and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) increased the policy repo 1 Based on Food and Agriculture Organisation\u2019s (FAO\u2019s) food price index for August 2022. rate by 140 basis points (bps) during May-August. Monetary policy remains focussed on withdrawal of accommodation. During April-September 2022, the MPC met four times, including an off-cycle meeting in May 2022. At the time of the MPC meeting in April 2022, the global economic and financial environment had turned challenging due to the sharp jump in international commodity prices and uncertainties around the pace of monetary policy normalisation globally. CPI inflation was at or above the upper threshold of 6 per cent for two successive months in January and February 2022. The MPC assessed that the ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions, the generalised hardening of global commodity prices, the likelihood of prolonged supply chain disruptions, dislocations in trade and capital flows, divergent monetary policy responses and volatility in global financial markets posed sizeable upside risks to the inflation trajectory and downside risks to domestic growth. Accordingly, the inflation forecast for 2022-23 was raised by 120 bps (relative to the February 2022 projections) to 5.7 per cent while the real GDP growth forecast was revised downward by 60 bps to 7.2 per cent. Faced with the twin challenge of high inflation and worsening growth outlook, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent. Although still accommodative, the stance of monetary policy focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. Concomitantly, the Reserve Bank introduced the standing deposit facility (SDF) at 40 bps above the fixed rate reverse repo rate as the floor of the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor, thus making the corridor symmetrical with a width of +/- 25 bps around the policy repo rate (see Chapter IV).2 With the CPI inflation print of March 2022 rising sharply to 7 per cent and significant upside risks to the near-term trajectory from higher food, crude oil and commodity prices materialising due to geopolitical tensions and sanctions, the MPC decided to hold an off-cycle meeting in May 2022. It noted that while economic activity was resilient, inflation at elevated levels warranted resolute and calibrated steps to anchor inflation expectations and contain second round effects. The MPC voted unanimously to increase the policy repo rate by 40 bps and reiterated the stance as set out in the April resolution. By the June 2022 MPC meeting, CPI inflation had risen further to 7.8 per cent in the April 2022 print, with considerable uncertainty around the outlook on account of the geopolitical situation. The MPC was of the view that continued shocks to food inflation, elevated international crude oil prices and pending pass-through of input costs to selling prices were likely to sustain pressures on headline inflation. Accordingly, the inflation forecast for 2022-23 was revised upwards by 100 bps from the April meeting to 6.7 per cent. Against this backdrop, the MPC judged that there was a need for calibrated monetary policy action to keep inflation expectations anchored and restrain the broadening of price pressures. Accordingly, it unanimously decided to increase the policy repo rate by 50 bps. The MPC focused the stance of policy on withdrawal of accommodation. At the time of the MPC\u2019s August 2022 meeting, CPI inflation had eased to 7 per cent during May-June 2022 from 7.8 per cent in April but remained above the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent. The MPC observed that while there was some let up in global commodity prices, spillovers from geopolitical shocks were imparting considerable uncertainty to the inflation trajectory. Domestic economic activity was 2 To manage the excess liquidity effectively during the pandemic phase, the LAF corridor was made asymmetric during March-April 2020, with reverse repo rate at 65 bps below the repo rate (25 bps prior to the pandemic) and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate at 25 bps above the repo rate. seen as resilient. With inflation projected to remain above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through the first three quarters of 2022-23, entailing the risk of destabilising inflation expectations and triggering second round effects, the MPC was of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action was needed to contain inflationary pressures, pull back headline inflation within the tolerance band closer to the target, and keep inflation expectations anchored to ensure sustained growth. Accordingly, the MPC unanimously decided to increase the repo rate by 50 basis points and maintained its stance of June 2022 with a majority of 5 to 1.

The #: as on September 29, 2022. Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. First, international crude oil prices have exhibited large volatility in H1. Brent crude oil prices hardened to US$ 121 per barrel by mid-June, driven by supply concerns due to sanctions on Russia. Prices have cooled off since then, as global demand is weakening. Continued supply management by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plus and gas-to-oil switching due to record natural gas prices have supported crude oil prices while the geopolitical conflict and sanctions weigh heavily on the outlook (Chart I.1.a & Chart I.1.b). Taking into account these developments, crude prices (Indian basket) are assumed at US$ 100 per barrel in the baseline, same Second, the INR exhibited a depreciating bias vis-\u00e0- elevated crude oil prices and portfolio outflows. The US dollar index strengthened by 16 per cent between end-March 2022 and September 27, reflecting Fed and expectations of future hikes. Taking these is assumed at INR 80 per US dollar in the baseline as Third, global economic prospects have weakened pronged headwinds discussed earlier (Chart I.2). Global trade is slowing down and there are increasing fell into contraction zone in August 2022 for the first time since June 2020. Global factors exert downward pressures on domestic activity and upward pressures on domestic inflation through a variety of channels (Box I.1). Global growth is expected to slow down from 6.1 per cent in 2021 to 3.2 per cent in 2022 and the outlook is \u201cgloomy and more uncertain\u201d, with risks tilted to the downside (IMF, 2022). Global consumer price inflation is projected by the IMF to increase from 4.7 per cent in 2021 to 8.3 per cent in 2022. These global stagflationary impulses can impact domestic growth and inflation through multiple channels. First, lower external demand drags down export demand and overall domestic demand and growth. At the same time, weak global demand can soften global commodity prices. Second, higher global commodity prices increase domestic inflation through direct and cost-push channels and dampen domestic growth through weakening of aggregate demand. Third, higher global inflation and global interest rates impact capital flows, put downward pressures on the domestic currency and lead to higher imported inflation. Based on the \u2018Rest of the World (RoW) Block\u2019 of the RBI\u2019s Quarterly Projection Model3, the peak impact on India\u2019s inflation and growth through all the channels occurs by four quarters. Second-round effects can keep inflation at elevated levels even beyond 8 quarters, necessitating appropriate monetary policy actions to anchor inflation In such circumstances, expectations frontloaded monetary policy actions by showing a strong commitment to the inflation target add to credibility gains and help in reining in inflation with lower output losses (John, Kumar and Patra, 2022). 3 The QPM belongs to the genre of consensus macroeconomic new Keynesian open economy structural models and is calibrated to incorporate the India- specific characteristics (Benes et al., 2016). CPI inflation has ruled at or above the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent since January 2022 albeit with some moderation in recent months (Chapter II). Looking ahead, the three months and one year ahead median inflation expectations of urban households increased by 50 bps each in the September 2022 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey compared to the previous round4. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate also increased in both the three months and one year ahead horizons vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round (Chart I.3). Manufacturing firms polled in the July-September 2022 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expected reduction in cost of raw materials as well as selling prices in Q3:2022-23 (Chart I.4a).5 Services and infrastructure sector companies also expected softening in input costs and selling prices in Q3:2022-23 (Charts I.4b and I.4c).6 The respondents in manufacturing and services PMI reported increase in input and output prices in August 2022, although with some moderation in the pace of inflationary pressures. Note: Net response is the difference between the share of respondents reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism. The range is -100 to 100. A positive/ negative value of net response is considered as optimistic/pessimistic from the view point of respondent firms. Therefore, higher positive values of selling prices indicate increase in output prices while lower values for the cost of raw materials/cost of inputs indicate higher input price pressures and vice versa. 4 The Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 (18 cities in the previous rounds) and the results of the September 2022 round are based on responses from 6,052 households. 5 The results of the July-September 2022 round of the industrial outlook survey are based on responses from 1,234 companies. 6 Based on 469 services and 124 infrastructure companies polled in the July-September 2022 round of the services and infrastructure outlook survey. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in September 2022 expected CPI inflation to soften and 4.9-5.0 per cent in H1:2023-24 (Chart I.5a and Table I.3).7 Long-run inflation expectations of professional forecasters \u2013 measured by their 5- and 10-year ahead expectations \u2013 remained broadly aligned around during the pandemic period. In the September round, the 5-year ahead expected inflation rose by 10 bps remained unchanged at 4.5 per cent (Chart I.5b). Looking ahead, several exogenous factors \u2013 global and domestic \u2013 will impinge on the inflation outlook.

Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward- looking surveys and estimates from structural and other time-series models, CPI inflation is projected to average 6.7 per cent in 2022-23 \u2013 7.1 per cent in Q2, 6.5 per cent in Q3 and 5.8 per cent in Q4, with risks evenly balanced (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2022-23 are 4.7-6.9 per cent and 4.0-7.6 per cent, respectively. For 2023-24, assuming a normal monsoon, a progressive normalisation of supply chains, and no further exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will average 5.2 per cent. In Q4:2023-24, CPI inflation is projected at 5.2 per cent, with the 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals at 3.5-7.0 per cent and 2.5-7.9 per cent, respectively. The baseline forecasts are subject to several upside and downside risks. The upside risks emanate from a further ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions, higher global crude and commodity prices, escalation in global financial market volatility due to aggressive monetary policy actions, longer-than-expected supply Note: The fan chart depicts uncertainty around the baseline projection path.

The downside risks could arise from an early resolution of geopolitical tensions, further correction in global commodity prices due to slowing global demand, and further improvement in supply conditions with the ebbing of the pandemic. The global surge in inflation draws its origins from two large adverse shocks in quick succession \u2013 the COVID\u201319 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine \u2013 reinforced by demand pressures emanating from sizeable monetary- fiscal stimuli. With more integrated global value chains, sectoral and country-specific shocks now transmit more swiftly than ever before (de Soyres and Franco, 2020)8. The cost-push inflationary impact of global shocks on the Indian economy can be captured through Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) tables (OECD, 2021). The potential impact of country-specific sectoral shocks is estimated by using the Leontief Inverse Matrix to identify the countries and sectors that can pose highest cost-push inflationary risks. Intermediate goods accounted for almost half of all global trade, with trade comprising about 30 per cent of world output in 2021 (United Nations aggregated by using CPI weights ( from the jth country and sector. is the spillover is the spillover from the kth L is the Leontief inverse, I is an identity matrix and A is the technical coefficient matrix derived from ICIO, with dimensions (J*K x J*K) \u2013 J and K are the total number is the shock vector modelled as a unit shock (one per cent), adjusted for the relative share of the shock size The empirical analysis indicates that a global inflation shock of one percentage point - modelled as a simultaneous one per cent increase in prices across all the countries and sectors \u2013 could increase inflation in India by around 63 bps through second round effects comprising domestic indirect effects (46 bps) and global spillovers (17 bps)9, in addition to the direct impact of 100 bps (Chart I.2.1).

Global spillovers, representing the imported inflation channel, are driven by price pressures in energy, mining, chemicals, trade, basic metals and machinery. In terms of source countries, the most important contributors to inflation in India are oil exporting countries, China and the United States. de Soyres, F. and S. Franco. (2019), \u201cInflation Dynamics and Global Value Chains\u201d, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 9090. The current bout of global inflation is mainly driven by the jump in global energy and agricultural product prices (which rose by almost 40 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, during H2:2021-22). The empirical analysis suggests that the global food and energy shocks experienced during H2:2021-22 could ceteris paribus impart upward pressure of around 2.5 percentage points Ebbing COVID-19 infections and improving consumer sentiment facilitated a rebound in demand for contact-intensive services and supported domestic demand in H1:2022-23. Industry and services sectors are holding up well and kharif sowing has seen a smart recovery. The above-normal south- west monsoon has improved reservoir levels which bodes well for the winter crops. Investment activity is expected to benefit from the government\u2019s capex push, growth in bank credit, improving demand conditions and rising capacity utilisation. in global Geopolitical financial market volatility and tightening global financial conditions, however, weigh heavily on the outlook. the though overall pessimistic zone. Households remained optimistic for the year ahead, with the future expectations index remaining unchanged vis-\u00e0-vis the July 2022 survey round (Chart I.7).10 remained Turning to the key messages from forward-looking surveys, consumer confidence (the current situation index) increased further in the September 2022 survey round on account of improved perception on general economic situation and overall spending, 10 The Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 (13 cities in the previous rounds) and the results of the September 2022 round are based on responses from 6,062 respondents. Optimism the manufacturing sector for the quarter ahead waned marginally in the July-September 2022 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, though it remained well in the expansion zone (Chart I.8a). Services sector companies expected slight moderation while infrastructure companies expected a minor uptick in Q3:2022-23 in terms of the overall business situation (Charts I.8b and I.8c). broadly balanced around this baseline path (Chart I.10 and Table I.3). For 2023-24, assuming a normal monsoon, and no major exogenous or policy shocks, the structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 6.5 per cent. There are upside and downside risks to the baseline growth path. Upside risks to the baseline trajectory Recent surveys by other agencies indicate a dip in business expectations over their respective previous rounds (Table I.4). In the August 2022 round of the PMI survey, business expectations of manufacturing and services firms improved to multi-year highs on optimism over strengthening demand. Professional forecasters polled in the September 2022 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey expected real GDP growth at 6.3 per cent in Q2:2022-23, 4.8 per cent in Q3 and 4.2 per cent in Q4, and at 6.4-6.6 per cent in H1:2023-24 (Chart I.9 and Table I.3). Taking into account the baseline assumptions, survey indicators and model forecasts, real GDP growth is expected at 7.0 per cent in 2022-23 \u2013 6.3 per cent in Q2; and 4.6 per cent each in Q3 and Q4 \u2013 with risks Note: The fan chart depicts uncertainty around the baseline projection path.

On the contrary, an escalation in geopolitical tensions, further hardening of international crude oil and other commodity prices, sustained disruptions to supply chains, the upsurge in global financial market volatility, and a sharper loss of momentum in global trade and demand pose downside risks to the baseline growth path. Baseline projections of inflation and growth are conditional on assumptions of the future course of key domestic and international macroeconomic variables set out in Table I.2. There are, however, sizeable uncertainties around the baseline assumptions, as stated earlier. This section explores plausible alternative scenarios to assess the balance of risks around the baseline projections. The downside risks to global growth flagged in the April 2022 MPR have materialised. Headwinds from the war, elevated commodity prices, tightening from financial emerging economies, and the slowing global activities could pull global growth further below the baseline. There are growing concerns of recession in major economies and the global outlook is bleak and risks are tilted to the downside. In such a scenario, if global growth is 100 bps below the baseline, domestic growth and inflation could be around 40 bps and 20 bps, respectively, below the baseline trajectories. Conversely, if there is an early de- escalation in geopolitical tensions, the recent trend in falling commodity prices continues, and global inflation ebbs faster than expected, there can be a fillip to global growth. In this scenario, assuming that global growth surprises by 50 bps on the upside, domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by Global crude oil prices remain at elevated levels, driven by geopolitical tensions, sanctions and supply management by OPEC plus. Further production curtailment by OPEC plus and the spike in the seasonal winter demand for energy amidst high natural gas prices could harden international crude oil prices. Assuming crude oil prices (Indian basket) to be 10 per cent above the baseline of US$ 100 per barrel, domestic inflation and growth could be higher by 30 bps and weaker by around 20 bps, respectively, over the baseline. Conversely, crude oil prices could soften below the baseline owing to global demand losing momentum and an easing of geopolitical tensions. As a result, if the Indian basket of crude prices falls by 10 per cent relative to the baseline, inflation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 20 bps to growth (Charts I.11a and I.12a). The INR depreciated in H1, driven by the generalised strengthening of the US dollar, higher crude oil prices and sales by foreign portfolio investors. Volatility in global financial markets is expected to persist due to the uncertainty around monetary policy normalisation in the US and other major advanced economies, which could put downward pressure on the INR. Should the INR depreciate by 5 per cent from the baseline, inflation could edge up by around 20 bps while GDP growth could be higher by around 15 bps through boost to exports. On the other hand, given India\u2019s relatively better growth performance and outlook and strong domestic macroeconomic fundamentals, portfolio equity flows turned significantly positive in August 2022 and could increase further. In this scenario, if the INR appreciates by 5 per cent relative to the baseline, inflation and GDP growth could moderate by around 20 bps and 15 bps, respectively (Charts I.11b and I.12b). food prices and headline inflation could be around 50 bps above the baseline (Charts I.11b and I.12b). Food inflation remained high during H1, driven by the war-induced jump in global food prices. Global food prices have started correcting and these are being reflected in the softening of domestic edible oil prices. Furthermore, kharif sowing has caught up with its long-term average. Reservoir levels are above last year\u2019s and the decadal average, which augur well for the rabi crop. Although the area under paddy sowing has been lower than a year ago due to uneven distribution of south-west monsoon rainfall, ample buffer stocks of rice and effective supply management measures could soften food inflation more than anticipated, and push headline inflation 50 bps below the baseline. Conversely, global food prices could harden in view of the fragile geopolitical outlook and sustained input price pressures on critical inputs like energy and fertilisers. Furthermore, unseasonal heavy rainfalls during the harvesting period could impact the domestic crop. In such a scenario, there could be upward pressures on The Indian economy is advancing steadily, and is expected to be one of the fastest growing major economies in 2022. The above-normal south-west monsoon, improved reservoir position, government\u2019s capex push, improvement in capacity utilisation, a broad-based revival in credit growth, strong corporate and bank balance sheets, upbeat consumer and business confidence and receding threat of the pandemic are all factors likely to provide impetus to growth. While inflation has eased somewhat from the April high, supported by some correction in global prices, it has ruled above the upper tolerance threshold around the target since January 2022. Monetary policy has moved into the withdrawal of accommodation mode and remains focussed to ensure that inflation returns to the target while supporting growth. The daunting global environment, however, imparts considerable uncertainty to the outlook. The trajectory of consumer price index (CPI) inflation since February 2022 has been altered by spillovers from the conflict in Ukraine. CPI inflation peaked in April 2022 and has since then moderated but persists above the pre-war levels and also above the upper tolerance band. During H1:2022-23, industrial and farm input pressures remained firm, notwithstanding some softening. Nominal rural wage growth was muted. Since February 2022, the trajectory of headline CPI inflation1 has been altered by spillovers from adverse global commodity price shocks triggered by the conflict in Ukraine. In February, it was anticipated bottlenecks, sanctions and second-round effects. Global financial market volatility engendered by aggressive monetary tightening and consequent spillovers to domestic financial markets exacerbated inflationary pressures. disruptions would ease with the ebbing of COVID-19 measures and a normal monsoon would bring about course of the year. The war upended this narrative Headline CPI inflation was already testing the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent during January- February 2022, due to adverse base effects, and a sticky core component.2 Starting March, the fallout of the adverse global commodity price shocks spread across items. In April, the heat wave and consequent production losses added to a sharp pick-up in prices. Note: The imputed CPI prints for April and May 2020 have been regarded as a break in the CPI series. Sources: National Statistical Office (NSO); and RBI staff estimates. 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in the all-India consumer price index (CPI) produced by the National Statistical Office (NSO). 2 Core CPI, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups \u2018food and beverages\u2019 and \u2018fuel and light\u2019 from the headline CPI. As a result, headline inflation surged by 173 basis points in two months \u2013 from 6.1 per cent in February to 7.8 per cent in April across food, fuel and core components. Judicious supply side interventions by the government and some softening of global commodity prices from their peak March 2022 levels enabled inflation to moderate to 6.7 per cent in July before it edged up to 7.0 per cent in August on a surge in food inflation (Chart II.1). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections, if any, and explain the underlying reasons thereof. The April 2022 MPR projected inflation at 6.3 per cent for Q1:2022- 23 and 5.8 per cent for Q2. War-induced price pressures as well as domestic supply shocks turned out to be stronger and more persistent than anticipated, resulting in actual inflation exceeding projections by around 100 bps each in Q1 and Q2 (July-August) (Chart II.2). This came about largely from substantial upward surprises in food inflation.3 The unprecedented increase in global food prices in March led to sharp increases in domestic prices of edible oils, animal-based proteins through high feed costs, and wheat through export linkages. At the same time, the adverse impact of the intense heat wave caused damage to the rabi wheat crop, and tomato prices jumped by 158.4 per cent (on a year-on-year basis) in June 2022. Processed food prices also registered increases as higher input costs were passed on to selling prices. The depreciation of the Indian rupee from the baseline of `76 per US$ to around `79-80 per US$ by August-September also contributed to projection errors, partly offset As explained in the preceding section, the surge in headline inflation in April was sharp and broad- based. Thereafter, a deceleration of the momentum of prices, supported by a large favourable base effect, brought down inflation to 7.0 per cent in May-June.4 The deceleration in momentum in May was located in remained robust. In June, headline momentum moderated further, across all major groups. In July, even as headline CPI momentum remained unchanged at June level, favourable base effect led to a softening 3 The April 2022 MPR had largely accounted for the persistence of international crude prices at elevated levels during 2022-23, with an assumption of US$ 100 per barrel. 4 A change in CPI y-o-y inflation between any two months is the difference between the current month-on-month (m-o-m) change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details, see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. d: CPI excluding Food and Fuel Note: The y-o-y inflation for April and May 2021 have been calculated based on the imputed index for April and May 2020 released by NSO. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. in inflation by 30 bps to 6.7 per cent. August was the third successive month with a steady momentum of 0.5 per cent; inflation, however, edged up by around 30 basis points as the favourable base effects waned (Chart II.3). The mean of the CPI inflation distribution rose to 6.8 per cent in 2022 (January-August) from 5.3 per cent during the corresponding period in 2021 and the pre-COVID average of 3.4 per cent for 2017-19 (January-August). This was accompanied by higher median rates and lower dispersion in the sub- group/group-wise distribution of inflation rates signifying generalisation of inflation (Chart II.4), and heightened uncertainty about future inflation (Box II.1). Sustained high inflation can lead to higher uncertainty and allocative inefficiency (Friedman, 1977; Ball, 1992). The impact of inflation variability can, however, be ambiguous, depending on whether the central bank tolerates higher inflation (Cukierman and Meltzer, 1986) or it is committed to the inflation target and adopts a contractionary policy (Holland, 1995). Using CPI data (month-on-month percentage changes of seasonally adjusted data) for the period April 2005 to July 2022, time-varying inflation uncertainty (or inflation volatility) is estimated by employing a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. Three specifications are estimated to address the various hypotheses using GARCH (2,1)5 estimates. Model I is the baseline model; in Model II, inflation rate is added to assess the Friedman-Ball hypothesis; in Model III, uncertainty (i.e., the variance of inflation) is included in the mean equation to explore the Cukierman\u2013Meltzer/ Holland hypothesis (Table II.1.1). The sum of ARCH and GARCH coefficients is in the range of 0.83 to 0.96 (i.e., less than 1), suggesting that inflation volatility exhibits high degree of persistence but is mean reverting (Chart II.1.1). The level of inflation is seen to have a positive impact on the variance of inflation (Model II), providing support for the Friedman-Ball hypothesis. Inflation volatility is seen to have a negative impact on the rate of inflation in line with the Holland hypothesis (Model III). Granger causality analysis indicates causality running from inflation to inflation volatility (Table II.1.2). Overall, the analysis suggests that high levels of inflation can raise uncertainty about future inflation and impinge upon inflation expectations, stressing the need for keeping inflation around the target.

Diffusion indices (DIs)6 also attest to generalised price increases across the CPI basket during March- April 2022 (Chart II.5a). A majority of the items in the CPI basket showed threshold DIs7 in excess of 4 per cent and 6 per cent, based on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate (saar). Though there was some let up during May-June, the spread of price increases accelerated during July-August. In August, a majority of CPI basket registered prices increases in excess of 4 per cent (saar) (Chart II.5b). 0 2 - g u A 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - g u A 0 2 - g u A 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - g u A 6 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. The higher the reading is above 50 for the diffusion index, the broader is the expansion or generalisation of price increases; the further is the reading below 50, the broader is the price decline across items. 7 Threshold diffusion indices capture the dispersion of price increases in CPI basket beyond the specified saar thresholds of 4 per cent and 6 per cent. A historical decomposition of inflation using vector autoregression (VAR)8 analysis to ascertain the relative role of various macro factors indicates that the rise in inflation during H1:2022-23 can be primarily attributed to adverse supply-side shocks from food along with fuel price shocks, while aggregate demand conditions continued to exert downward pressure on inflation (Chart II.6a). inflation During March-August contributed 86 per cent of headline inflation. (non-durable goods with a 7-day Perishables Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI. 8 Historical decomposition estimates the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period (Q4:2010-11 to Q2-2022-23) based on a vector autoregression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 crude oil prices (US$ per barrel); exchange rate (INR per US$), asset price (BSE Sensex), CPI; the output gap; rural wages; the policy repo rate; and money supply (M3). All variables other than policy repo rate are y-o-y growth rates. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et; where et represents a vector of shocks. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. recall9) like milk, tomatoes, potatoes, edible oils, cooked meals and chicken as well as semi-perishable goods (non-durable goods with a 30-day recall), like kerosene, particularly, petroleum products liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and petrol along with cereals and medicines were the main drivers of goods inflation (Char t II.6b). Durable goods contributed 12.8 per cent of overall inflation. The contribution of services (with a weight of 23.4 per cent in overall CPI) remained muted at around 14 per cent of headline inflation (Chart II.6b). The increase in global commodity prices following the conflict in Ukraine contributed to a surge in the contribution of imported components10 to headline inflation during March-June 2022. Subsequently, the decline in international commodity prices in July- August 2022 lowered imported inflation. The cut in central excise duties on petrol and diesel in May 2022 reduced domestically generated inflation (Chart II.6c). Food and beverages (with a weight of 45.9 per cent in CPI) inflation rose to 8.1 per cent in April 2022, owing to global supply shortages and adverse domestic weather conditions. Thereafter, food inflation eased to 6.7 per cent in July, supported by the Government\u2019s supply- side measures, some easing of international food prices and a substantial correction in tomato prices. In August, food inflation turned around to register a substantial pick-up, with cereals and vegetables being its key drivers (Chart II.7a and II.7b). 9 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Under MMRP, data are collected on expenditures incurred for frequently purchased items \u2013 edible oil, eggs, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, spices, beverages, processed foods, pan, tobacco and intoxicants \u2013 during the last seven days; for clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods, during the last 365 days; and for all other food, fuel and light, miscellaneous goods and services including non-institutional medical services, rents and taxes, data relate to the last 30 days. 10 Global commodities that drive domestic prices include petroleum products; coal; electronic goods; gold; silver; chemical products; metal products; textiles; cereals; milk products, and vegetables oils \u2013 these together have a weight of 36.4 per cent in the CPI basket. Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI - food and beverages. Sources: NSO and RBI staff estimates. Even as food inflation remained elevated, the food price build-up in the current financial year (August over March) so far was muted relative to historical patterns. First, food prices registered a sharp pick-up in March 2022 itself, primarily on account of meat and fish, and edible oils. Second, while the price build-up in cereals (which constitutes more than a fifth of the food basket) was higher than its long-term average as was those of fruits, spices, prepared meals and milk, these were offset by a substantial correction in edible oils, and meat and fish prices from historic highs in May and June. Third, the summer seasonal increase in vegetable prices was lower than usual due to a softer build-up in onion, garlic and some other vegetables prices in view of higher production (Chart II.8). elevated global prices due to the war, higher exports (157 per cent y-o-y during April-July 2022), and decline in stocks (0.9 times the buffer norms as on September 1, 2022). In response, restrictions on wheat exports were imposed since May 2022, and exports of wheat flour were banned from August 27, 2022. Rice prices increased due to the substitution of wheat by rice under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana Inflation in the prices of cereals (weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group) rose from 5.0 per cent in March 2022 to 9.6 per cent in August driven by sharp pick up in momentum (Chart II.9). Within cereals, wheat prices have increased sharply since March on account of lower domestic production ((-) 2.5 per cent in 2021-22) due to heat waves in major wheat producing states, (PMGKAY) for May-September 2022, higher exports (9.0 per cent y-o-y during April-July 2022), and a fall in area under kharif sowing and expected lower production. Large stocks of rice (2.6 times the buffer norm as of September 1, 2022) and restrictions on broken rice exports along with imposition of 20 per cent export duty on rice other than basmati and par- boiled rice are expected to withhold undue price pressures. Vegetable prices (weight of 6.0 per cent in the CPI and 13.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) inflation remained in double digits during March- August 2022, peaking in May. The spike in tomato prices (113.5 per cent during April-June 2022), along with price increases in other vegetables reflecting the usual summer uptick, remained the main drivers (Chart II.10). The negative contribution of onions and garlic, on an average, during April-August partly offset the inflationary pressures. Among key vegetables, onion prices moderated during March-May 2022 on account of higher production (an increase of 19 per cent in 2021-22) and record procurement (buffer stock of 2.5 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) in 2022-23). Subsequently, prices rose during June-August 2022 in line with the usual seasonal pattern. Potato prices increased during March-August 2022 due to lower production ((-) 4.6 per cent in 2021- 22). To rein in price pressures, free imports of potatoes were allowed from Bhutan until June 30, 2023. Tomato prices picked up dramatically during April-June 2022 due to the decline in production ((-) 4.0 per cent in 2021-22) coming from lower area sown, heat waves in north India and excess rains and cyclone in Karnataka. The upbeat production response to elevated prices led to robust mandi arrivals and the easing of tomato prices during July-August 2022. Inflation in prices of fruits (weight of 2.9 per cent in the CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages group) increased from 2.5 per cent in March 2022 to 7.4 per cent in August due to higher prices of bananas, apples, grapes and dry fruits. A spike in mango prices in April 2022 due to crop damage caused by heat waves and unseasonal rains also contributed to fruit price momentum.

Prices moderated in Q1:2022-23 in line with supply side measures by the government, including the extension of tur and urad imports under the \u2018free category\u2019 until March 31, 2023; the reduction in Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) on lentils to 0 per cent from 10 per cent extended till March 31, 2023; and higher production (8.8 per cent in 2021-22). However, inflation in pulses picked up gently during July-August, driven by shortfall in kharif sowing and the expected shortfall in production of tur and urad. Adverse base effects also contributed to the pick up in pulses inflation. The higher stock-to-use (STU) ratio (Chart II.11), aggressive procurement for central pool and supply-side interventions \u2013 like open market operations along with the decision to release chana dal at a discount to states and union territories (UTs) for welfare schemes \u2013 are, however, expected to contain pressures in pulses price in H2. Regarding animal-based protein items, prices increased sharply in H1:2022-23, driven by meat and fish (weight of 3.6 per cent in the CPI and 7.9 per cent within the food and beverages group) and milk and products (weight of 6.6 per cent in the CPI and 14.4 per cent within the food and beverages group) (Chart II.12). In the case of meat and fish, prices rose during March-June 2022, reflecting feed cost pressures amidst the early onset of summer, accompanied by heat waves. Price pressures eased in July-August 2022 due to reduced seasonal demand (on account of Sravana month) and imports of genetically modified (GM) soymeal. In contrast, a fall in prices along with favourable base effects dragged eggs price into deflation during April-August 2022. Milk and products prices increased consistently during March- August 2022, as major milk cooperatives (like Amul and Mother Dairy) raised retail prices by `2 per litre each in March and August 2022, citing an increase in input costs. This was followed by price increases by other state cooperatives. Inflation in prices of oils and fats (weight of 3.6 per cent in the CPI and 7.8 per cent within the food and beverages group) eased during H1:2022-23, reaching 4.6 per cent in August, after remaining in double digits for more than two years (Chart II.13). The moderation in inflation was supported by easing global prices, supply-side measures undertaken by the government and higher domestic production (4.9 per cent in 2021-22). Global prices of edible oils, which had surged in March with the onset of the war, by the government, including an extension of stock limits on edible oils and oilseeds up to December 31, 2022, the reduction in basic customs duty (BCD) to 0 per cent till March 31, 2023, allocation of tariff rate quota (TRQ) import of 2.0 million tonnes each for crude soybean and sunflower oil for the financial year 2022-23 and 2023-24 at 0 per cent BCD and AIDC and hike in minimum support prices (MSPs) of kharif oilseeds for 2022-23 (5.4 per cent to 8.9 per cent increase). On the other hand, rising milk prices resulted in upside pressures in ghee and butter prices. Notes: Figure in parentheses indicate weight in CPI-animal protein group. H1:2022-23 refers to April-August. Sources: NSO and RBI staff estimates. corrected with the lifting of the export ban (imposed pressures also abated due to the supply side steps Prices of sugar and confectionery (weight of 1.4 per cent in the CPI and 3.0 per cent in the food and beverages group) remained muted during March-July 2022 on the back of higher production (7.7 per cent increase in sugarcane production in 2022-23) and export restrictions on sugar effective from June 1, 2022 to ensure ample domestic supplies. However, prices increased in August 2022 on higher exports (which rose by 32.5 per cent y-o-y during April-July 2022) coming from a relaxation of export limits and from expectations of a healthy festive demand. Among other food items, inflation in prices of spices remained in double digits during H1:2022-23, reflecting lower production ((-) 1.9 per cent in 2021- 22), especially in the case of key spices like coriander, cumin, black pepper and red chillies. Furthermore, prepared meals witnessed a rise in prices, due to an increase in input costs such as edible oils, LPG and transport charges. Retail price margins \u2013 the difference of retail and wholesale prices11 \u2013 for cereals and pulses, which had been on the rise since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, remained at elevated levels during H1. 11 Item level retail and wholesale prices are aggregated at respective subgroups using item level CPI weights.

In the case of vegetables, margins rose in May-June 2022, driven by the sharp uptick in tomato retail prices, but they moderated subsequently with the correction in tomato prices (Chart II.14). prices. Electricity prices have remained in deflation Core inflation, i.e., CPI inflation excluding food and fuel, increased sharply after the start of the war February. It moderated thereafter on favourable base CPI fuel inflation surged from 7.5 per cent in March 2022 to 11.8 per cent by July 2022 on the back of sharp increases in LPG and subsidised kerosene (PDS) prices which, in turn, reflected the sharp jump in global energy prices following the conflict in Ukraine. Fuel inflation moderated to 10.8 per cent in August due to decline in kerosene (PDS) prices reflecting pass through of the fall in international During June-August, core inflation remained steady at around 6.0 per cent, including when other volatile items such as petrol, diesel, gold and silver are excluded (Table II.1). Core inflation has been persistent and elevated since 2021, due to repeated cost-push shocks in Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI - fuel and light.

During 2022-23 (April-August), core inflation averaged 6.2 per cent (5.9 per cent a year ago), with pressures broad- based, particularly in the goods component (Chart II.17). Notes: (1) Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI. (2) Derived as residual from headline CPI. The jump in core inflation by 126 basis points between February and April 2022 was considerably influenced by spillovers from the increases in international crude oil and gold prices following the start of the war in end-February. As international crude oil prices inched upwards of US$ 120 per barrel in March, domestic petrol and diesel pump prices rose by around `10 per litre between March 22 and April 6, 2022 and then remained unchanged till May 22, 2022. Pump prices then fell, following the reduction in excise duties CPI excluding food fuel (y-o-y, per cent) Coupled with favourable base effects, the cut in excise duties resulted in CPI petrol and diesel prices moving to the deflationary zone by August 2022. Price increases in WPI petrol and diesel were higher at 53 per cent (y-o-y) in August, largely reflecting the fact that indirect taxes are included in CPI but excluded from WPI (Chart II.19). On the whole, the reduction in excise duties had a direct softening impact of 43 bps on core inflation and 20 bps on headline inflation. The decline in gold prices during May-July also contributed to the moderation of core inflation. Threshold diffusion indices for CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver indicate that a large majority of items exhibited price increases in excess of 4 per cent and 6 per cent (on a saar basis) during March-April 2022. Although pressures relaxed to some extent during May-July, these firmed up again for a majority of items in August (Chart II.20). Inflation in CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver registered increases across both goods and services during March-August 2022, reflecting pass-through of pent-up input cost pressures to output prices (Chart II.21a). During this period, core goods inflation remained significantly higher than core services inflation. Inflation in the goods component (with a weight of 20.7 per cent in the headline CPI) increased from 7.1 per cent in February 2022 to 7.7 per cent in April, driven by clothing and footwear items, household goods and personal care items (including fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) and household utensils) along with health, transport and communications goods. Though core goods inflation moderated to 6.5 per cent in May, the respite was short-lived as it edged up by around 72 bps during June-August, coming mainly from a further rise in inflation in clothing and footwear, and household goods and personal care items. Core services inflation (with a weight of 23.0 per cent in the headline CPI) also rose from 4.7 per cent in February 2022 to 5.2 per cent in August (Chart II.21b), due to pressures from education (tuition and other fees), transport services (bus/tram/taxi fare, airfare, steamer/boat charges) and housing. Despite some rise, inflation in housing, the largest component in services, remained muted in H1 (averaging 3.8 per cent between April-August). s t n i o p e g n a t n e c r e p n n o i t u b i r t n o C 0 2 - g u A 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - g u A Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI.

Lower food inflation, combined with the high weightage of food in the CPI-AL and the CPI- RL vis-\u00e0-vis the CPI, contributed to the lower inflation prints during this period. In August 2022, with the rise in food prices, CPI-AL and CPI-RL inflation moved close to/marginally above CPI headline inflation. Inflation 12 While exclusion-based measures drop a fixed set of volatile items (for example, food and fuel) in each period, trimmed measures exclude items located in the tails of the inflation distribution - items displaying changes more than the specified threshold in prices each month are excluded and the items dropped differ from month to month. 2022 as food inflation was generally lower in the CPI- IW vis-\u00e0-vis the CPI. Moreover, lower housing inflation in CPI-IW, paired with high weightage of housing vis-\u00e0- vis the headline, also added to the softness in CPI-IW inflation prints. WPI inflation has been in double digits since April 2021 and increased to an all-time high of 16.6 per cent (as per the WPI series, 2011-12=100) in May 2022 before moderating during June-August. Despite strong favourable base effects, the spike in crude oil and commodity prices following the war drove WPI inflation during March-May 2022. The steep rise in international commodity prices resulted in WPI non-food manufactured products inflation persisting in double digits during May 2021-May 2022. WPI inflation moderated to 12.4 per cent in August 2022 on account of an easing of price pressures in basic metals, textiles, and food products, particularly vegetable and animal oils and fats, in an environment of favourable base effects. In line with WPI inflation, the deflators for gross value added (GVA) and gross domestic product (GDP) edged up sharply between Q4:2021-22 to Q1:2022-23 (Chart II.22a). During March-August 2022, all the major sub-groups of WPI remained substantially above their corresponding CPI subgroups (Chart II.22b). Petrol and diesel prices inflation in WPI exceeded CPI inflation, largely reflecting the reductions in excise duty and state VAT rates which are captured in CPI but are excluded in WPI. High energy prices in the international market are mirrored in the fuel and power group of the WPI. The spike in international commodity prices and industrial intermediaries resulted in a hardening of WPI non-food manufactured products inflation, which also contributed to WPI inflation ruling above the CPI. Within food, WPI inflation was higher than CPI in cereals, vegetables, fruits, eggs and spices. Moreover, WPI does not include services, which is witnessing lower inflation compared with goods inflation in the CPI. s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 0 2 - g u A 1 2 - g u A 2 2 - g u A During H1:2022-23 (up to August), cost pressures measured by WPI inflation in industrial raw materials and farm inputs remained firm, notwithstanding some softening. Inflation in the prices of industrial inputs \u2013 such as high-speed diesel (HSD), naphtha, aviation turbine fuel (ATF), bitumen, petroleum coke, and furnace oil \u2013 which had peaked at 34.1 per cent in May 2022 under the impact of high crude oil prices moderated to 22.1 per cent in August with the correction in crude prices (Chart II.23). After hardening during March-May 2022, the prices of non-food primary articles eased from June 2022 due to the moderation in the prices of fibres and oilseeds mirroring international price trends. Prices of minerals, despite mixed trends and high volatility, broadly eased during March-August 2022. During July- August 2022, the pressures on industrial raw materials prices ebbed in line with the easing global metal prices. The export duty hike on iron ore and certain steel products also helped to contain price pressures (Chart II.23). The farm input price inflation was largely driven by increase in HSD prices, agricultural and forestry machinery, fodder on account of dry weather conditions, and fertilisers. Inflation in price of WPI electricity \u2013 a key input in both industrial and farm inputs \u2013 increased sharply due to positive momentum as well as adverse base effects. Nominal rural wage growth for both agricultural and non-agricultural labourers remained muted during H1:2022-23 (up to July) (Chart II.24). This can be expected to contain the build-up of a wage-price spiral (Box II.2). Available data on rural wages and rural consumer price indices show episodes of co-movement as well as marked divergences (notably July 2010-October 2013 when rural real wages registered sharp increases, outpacing CPI inflation) (Chart II.2.1). Long run equation: ln(price) = a x ln(wage) + ECT Long run equation: ln(wage) = a x ln(price) + ECT In order to explore wage-price dynamics, a state-level cointegration panel analysis of the relationship between rural prices (using data for CPI-Rural) and rural wages (for agricultural and non-agricultural workers) for the pre-COVID period of April 2017 to February 2020 is undertaken. Pedroni\u2019s panel tests suggest the existence of a long-term cointegrating relation between wages and prices. The long and short-run dynamics are examined on the basis of the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator (Pesaran et al., 1999). The long-run coefficients are below unity in both the prices and wage equations (0.41 and 0.57, respectively), indicating less than proportional increase in prices in response to wage shocks and vice versa. Turning to short-run dynamics, the coefficients of the error correction term (ECT) in both the equations Note: ***, ** and * indicate significance at 1, 5 and 10 per cent levels, respectively. Figures in parentheses indicate standard errors. 1. The sample consists of 17 major states for the period April 2017 to Feb are significant: in the case of any shock, both prices and wages adjust quickly towards their long-run levels, and the speed of adjustment in prices is somewhat faster than in wages (Table II.2.1). 1 0 - g u A 8 0 - g u A 5 1 - g u A 2 2 - g u A In the organised sector, growth in staff cost (y-o-y basis) decelerated in Q1:2022-23 in both manufacturing and services sectors.

One-year ahead business inflation expectations after peaking in April 2022, fell during May-July but ticked up in August 2022, according to the survey by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.14 Survey respondents also reported that cost pressures re-emerged in August and optimism on sales and profit margins fell. p a G x e d n I According to manufacturing firms polled in the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) surveys, while input prices rose, there was an easing of the momentum during May-August 2022 due to softening metal and intermediate goods prices. In PMI services, input prices remained elevated, with an easing of the momentum in June-August 2022. Output price inflation for both manufacturing and services sectors was benign relative to input price inflation and the input-output price gap has moderated due to the softening input prices momentum, coupled with gradual pass-through of cost burdens (Chart II.27). Inflationary pressures have escalated globally due to the successive black swan events \u2013 the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. Mirroring global developments, India also experienced a sharp pick-up in inflationary pressures in H1, following the jump in global commodity prices as well as due to adverse 0 2 - g u A 1 2 - g u A domestic weather shocks. Consumer price inflation peaked in April 2022. It has since then moderated, but persists above the pre-war levels and also above the upper tolerance band. Its return to the target is expected to be gradual. The outlook is, however, fraught with considerable uncertainties, given the highly volatile geopolitical situation, spillovers from the elevated global financial market volatility and recurring adverse climatic conditions. Monetary policy remains focused on ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth. 2 2 - g u A 14 The monthly Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, polls a panel of businesses, primarily the manufacturing sector, about their inflation expectations in the short and medium term. The latest survey (August 2022 round) was based on the responses of around 900 companies. Domestic economic activity exhibited resilience in H1:2022-23. The buoyancy in aggregate demand was supported by private consumption and investment demand. Geopolitical tensions, tightening of global financial markets and global economic slowdown, however, pose downside risks to the domestic outlook. Domestic economic activity exhibited resilience momentum relative to H2:2021-22. With the recovery aggregate supply conditions are improving. Aggregate demand is underpinned by private consumption, which is holding up well and set to be boosted in the festival season. Investment activity gained Real gross domestic product (GDP) posted a growth of 13.5 per cent (year-on-year, y-o-y) in Q1:2022-23, aided by favourable base effects. Accordingly, real GDP surpassed pre-pandemic level by 3.8 per cent (Chart III.1 and Table III.1). All constituents of aggregate demand recorded expansion in Q1 and were above their respective pre-pandemic levels. traction with robust government capex. On the other contraction in net exports have operated as drags. elevated international commodity prices, heightened in external demand are the key downside risks to the The momentum \u2013 the quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) seasonally adjusted annualised growth rate (saar) - was, however, negative in Q1:2022-23, pulled down by government consumption and a sharp jump in imports (Chart III.1a and b). Available data for Q2 indicate that aggregate demand remained buoyant, supported by the ongoing recovery in private consumption and investment demand.

The April 2022 Monetary Policy Report (MPR) had projected real GDP growth at 16.2 per cent for Q1:2022-23. Actual growth undershot the projection by 270 basis points (bps) (Chart III.2), due to a larger- than-expected drag from net exports and sluggish growth in government expenditure. The growth in imports at 37.2 per cent in Q1 surprised significantly on the upside. Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) \u2013 the mainstay of aggregate demand \u2013 recorded a solid growth of 25.9 per cent in Q1:2022-23 and its share in overall GDP inched up to 59.9 per cent from 54.0 per cent a year ago. Expanded vaccination coverage and milder new COVID-19 infections (Chart III.3) provided a fillip to consumer confidence and discretionary spending, particularly on travel, hotels and restaurants, recreation and culture. Amongst the high frequency indicators (HFIs) of urban consumption, domestic air passenger traffic recorded a sustained recuperation, albeit still lagging its pre-pandemic levels (Chart III.4a). Passenger vehicle sales posted strong growth in Q1 and Q2, surging past pre-pandemic levels, despite headwinds from protracted supply chain disruptions (Chart III.4b). The production of consumer durables gained traction, boosted by discretionary spending (Chart III.4c). Improving urban consumption was also reflected in the acceleration in bank credit to households (Chart III.4d). a: New Cases (7-day moving average) Rural demand remained muted in Q1:2022-23, with some signs of recovery in Q2. Work demanded under August 2022, with improving conditions in the rural farm labour market. Motorcycle sales expanded y-o-y and exceeded pre-pandemic levels in August. The production of consumer non-durables remained subdued in H1. Tractor sales remained above their pre-pandemic levels, although they were lower y-o-y in July-August partly due to the high base of record sales registered last year. Fertiliser sales recovered in August with the progress of kharif sowing (Chart III.5). As per the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy\u2019s (CMIE) Consumer Pyramids data, the labour force participation rate recovered in Q2 from the dip seen in June, which pulled up the unemployment rate in August across urban and rural segments (Chart III.6a). The Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) payrolls data pointed to improving employment conditions in the organised sector during July 2022 (Chart III.6b). According to Naukri Jobspeak data, increased hiring was witnessed in hospitality, retail, insurance, real estate, banking and financial services segments. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) recorded a growth of 20.1 per cent in Q1:2022-23; consequently, the share of GFCF in GDP rose to 34.7 per cent in Q1 from 32.8 per cent a year ago. Construction activity exhibited buoyancy, with the housing sector recording an uptick in terms of both units launched and sold during Q1. The proximate coincident indicators of construction activity \u2013 steel consumption and cement production \u2013 posted strong growth in H1 (Chart III.7). Imports of capital goods were led by electronics goods while the domestic production of capital goods crossed its pre-pandemic level in June- July 2022. According to the RBI\u2019s survey1, capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector declined to 72.4 per cent in Q1:2022-23 from 75.3 per cent in the previous quarter, reflecting seasonal pattern. Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation, however, rose to 74.3 per cent in Q1:2022-23 \u2013 the highest in the last three years \u2013 from 73.0 per cent in the previous quarter (Chart III.8). Manufacturing firms recorded a sequential uptick in new orders during Q1:2022-23. Infrastructure firms displayed optimism on the overall business situation. turnover and employment in Q2:2022-23. The interest coverage ratio (ICR)2 of listed non- financial private companies in the manufacturing and information technology (IT) sectors remained high in Q1:2022-23, and indicates comfortable debt servicing capacity and conducive conditions for expansion in capacity (Chart III.9). in government final consumption The growth expenditure (GFCE) remained muted at 1.3 per cent in Q1:2022-23 [(-) 4.8 per cent a year ago], which dampened GDP growth (Table III.1). Revenue expenditure of the central government rose by 4.8 per cent (y-o-y) during April-July 2022 as against a contraction of 7.0 per cent Note: Data for Q1:2022-23 are based on results of 1,709 listed private manufacturing companies and 722 listed private non-financial services companies.

Component-wise, the impact of higher outgoes on interest payments was cushioned by lower spending on major subsidies, especially food. Capital outlay, on the other hand, surged by 59.4 per cent during April-July 2022, reflecting the government\u2019s sustained thrust on infrastructure. This led to a qualitative improvement in spending \u2013 the revenue expenditure to capital outlay (RECO) ratio decreased to 4.8 in April-July 2022 from 7.3 in the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart III.10a). Frontloaded capital expenditure was driven by increased spending in road and railway sectors (Chart III.10b). On the receipts side, the central government\u2019s gross tax revenues remained buoyant, registering a growth of 24.9 per cent during April-July 2022, driven by direct tax and GST collections. Monthly GST collections (Centre plus states) remained above `1.4 lakh crore improving since March 2022, benefitting from economic activity and compliance (Chart III.11). Union excise duties and customs duties, however, contracted on the back of cuts in excise duty on petrol and diesel in May 2022 and a reduction in customs duty on commodities such as cotton and palm oil. During April-July 2022, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) and the revenue deficit (RD) of the central government at 20.5 per cent and 16.4 per cent of the full-year budget estimate (BE), respectively, were lower than in the previous year. As regards state governments, their consolidated GFD is budgeted at 3.3 per cent of their conslolidated GSDP in 2022-233 \u2013 within the 4 per cent4 limit allowed by the Centre \u2013 supported by a healthy growth in revenue receipts (Table III.3 and Chart III.13a). The states The central government\u2019s non-tax revenues fell during April-July due to lower dividends and profits (Chart III.12). The recently concluded 5G spectrum auctions would provide a total revenue of `1.5 lakh crore; of this, the first annual instalment would amount to `17,875 crore. Disinvestment receipts jumped to `24,560 crore from `8,371 crore, driven by the proceeds of the initial public offer (IPO) of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).

This would increase the capital outlay-GSDP ratio to 2.7 per cent in 2022-23 from 2.2 per cent in 2021-22 (PA). According to available data, the states\u2019 GFD declined substantially in Q1:2022-23 on account of higher revenues and devolution from the Centre (Chart III.13b). Revenue expenditure of states grew by 14.3 per cent while capital expenditure contracted by 9.6 per cent. The Union Budget 2022-23 provided for a 50-year interest-free loan of `1 lakh crore to states under for Capital the Investment\u2019 scheme, over and above the borrowing limit of 4 per cent of GSDP. In August 2022, the Centre released two instalments of tax devolution amounting `1.16 lakh crore to the states to boost their capex. In the Union Budget 2022-23, gross and net market borrowings were placed at `14.95 lakh crore and `11.19 lakh crore, respectively. Taking into account the switch operations conducted just before the Union Budget 2022-23, the gross market borrowings through dated securities for 2022-23 are estimated at `14.31 lakh crore. The centre\u2019s gross issuances of market borrowings during H1:2022-23 (up to September 27, 2022) were `7.96 lakh crore (55.6 per cent of the full year\u2019s budgeted amount) as against `8.45 lakh crore planned in the calendar for H1 (Table III.4). The weighted average cost and maturity of issuances during H1 (up to September 27, 2022) were 7.3 per cent and 15.7 years, respectively, as against 6.2 per cent and 16.7 years, respectively, during 2021-22. States raised gross market borrowings of `2.76 lakh crore during H1 (up to September 27, 2022), 68.8 per cent of the indicative calendar. The Ways and Means Advances (WMA) limit for the Central Government for H1:2022-23 was enhanced to `1.5 lakh crore from `1.2 lakh crore in H1:2021-22 for bridging temporary mismatches between receipts and expenditure. For states/union territories, the WMA limits were fixed at `47,010 crore effective from April 1, 2022 as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advances to State Governments (Chairman: Shri Sudhir Shrivastava). Amidst persisting geopolitical tensions and slowing external demand, merchandise exports lost pace during Q2 (July-August) after remaining resilient during Q1. Merchandise imports, however, remained buoyant during both Q1 and Q2 (July-August), reflecting strong domestic demand conditions. These developments led to a widening of the merchandise trade deficit (Chart III.14). Services trade, both exports and impressive performance in Q1. With the growth of imports well imports registered an above that of exports, net exports dragged down aggregate demand in Q1:2022-23 [(-) 8.1 per cent of GDP as compared with (-) 5.0 per cent in Q4:2021-22 and (-) 3.0 per cent a year ago]. In April-August 2022, merchandise exports were driven by petroleum products, electronics, chemicals, engineering goods and ready-made garments. iron ore, cotton yarn, plastic and Exports of linoleum, handicrafts and carpets were, however, restrained (Chart III.15). Export restrictions on a few commodities such as wheat, steel and sugar due to domestic demand-supply balance also weighed on merchandise exports. Rising domestic demand and high international commodity prices propelled merchandise imports in H1:2022-23 (April-August). Oil imports accounted for around half of this growth. Non-oil non-gold imports also remained strong led by coal, electronics, chemicals, and machinery. Coal imports grew substantially, despite elevated international prices, as the domestic demand for energy soared. The trade deficit more than doubled to US$ 124.5 billion in April-August 2022 from US$ 53.8 billion a year ago. Merchandise exports are sensitive to global trade volumes while merchandise imports are driven by domestic demand (Box III.1). Services sector trade posted a robust growth in H1:2022-23 (April-July), building upon the significant India\u2019s share in global merchandise exports has risen steadily from 0.9 per cent in 2005 to 1.7 per cent in 2019 (pre-pandemic). After the COVID-19 disruption, both exports and imports rebounded strongly in 2021- 22. It is important to understand the drivers of Indian exports and imports and assess the relevant exchange rate and income elasticities on a disaggregated basis. For this, a panel cointegration analysis of 62 exported goods and 41 imported goods, belonging to four major groups, viz. agriculture commodities, metals, minerals and metal products, petroleum products and chemical and pharmaceutical products is undertaken. The volumes of exports and imports are determined by the item-level relative prices of exports/imports5, 5 The relative prices of India\u2019s exports are derived by dividing the implied prices of India\u2019s exported goods at item-level (dollar value by volume) by corresponding international prices, while relative prices of imports are the ratio of landed prices of item-level imports (value of imported goods divided by volume) to wholesale price indices of the relevant commodity groups. real effective exchange rate (REER), global demand (for exports), and domestic demand (for imports) (Raissi et al 2015). Relative prices measure industry-specific competitiveness while the REER (40-currency trade- or export-weighted) is as an indicator of overall external competitiveness; the empirical analysis explores the sensitivity of the results to both these indicators. World trade volume6 and domestic demand (GDP excluding imports at constant prices) are used as indicators of global demand and domestic activity, respectively. The empirical analysis is based on pre-pandemic data (Q1:2011-12 to Q3:2019-20), using the pooled mean group (PMG) estimator (Pesaran et al., 1999). The results indicate the presence of a long-run co- integrating relationship between exports, relative prices, REER and global demand on the one hand, and between imports, relative prices, REER and domestic demand, on the other hand. Productivity gains can support exports which are also highly elastic to global demand. Merchandise imports exhibit a strong co-movement with domestic economic activity, with an elasticity close to unity. The estimated elasticity of exports with respect to REER ranges from (-) 0.37 to (-) 0.39 in alternate specifications and from (+) 0.41 to (+) 0.63 for imports. India\u2019s exports could get some boost from productivity gains, policy initiatives like the One District, One Notes: ***, ** and * indicate statistical significance at 1 per cent, 5 per cent and 10 per cent level of significance, respectively.

Services exports growth remained in double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter in Q1, buoyed by software services, business, travel and transportation services. Software and business services together constitute more than 60 per cent share of India\u2019s total services exports. Although the risks of a recession in the US and Europe weigh on the software services sector, India\u2019s offshoring capabilities and competencies and significant investments made by the major IT companies towards automation, cost efficiency, cloud adoption and technology are expected to keep the sector resilient. Services imports increased during In July, services exports and imports remained buoyant, albeit the growth moderated. The current account deficit was 2.8 per cent of GDP in Q1: 2022-23. The merchandise trade deficit was at 8.1 per cent of GDP while the net invisibles surplus was Turning to the financial account, net FDI flows stayed robust at US$ 18.8 billion during April-July 2022 (Chart III.18). Manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, computer services, financial services, and communication services accounted for a major share of FDI in India during Q1. Singapore, Mauritius, the UAE, the US and the Netherlands were the major source countries of inward FDI to India, accounting for around 78 per cent of the total inflows. 7.4 billion during 2021. Net flows under non- resident deposits moderated to US$ 1.4 billion lower inflows in NRE deposits. As on September 23, 2022, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stood Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) reduced their exposure in domestic capital market in Q1, reflecting the generalised risk aversion towards EME assets in the face of the strengthening of US dollar, intensified geopolitical tensions, elevated global inflation and faster policy tightening by major central banks. FPIs, however, turned net buyers in Q2 with an investment of US$ 7.5 billion (up to September 28). Aggregate supply \u2013 measured by gross value added (GVA) at basic prices \u2013 expanded by 12.7 per cent in Q1:2022-23 (18.1 per cent a year ago), surpassing its remained robust, industrial GVA growth moderated the lingering disruptions in global supply chains. The momentum of GVA, measured by q-o-q saar, was negative in Q1:2022-23 (Chart III.19). Note: FRE: First revised estimates; PE: Provisional estimates.

After a sluggish start, the south-west monsoon (SWM) gained momentum in July-August and the season\u2019s rainfall stood at 7 per cent above the long period average (LPA) as on September 29, 2022 (1 per cent below LPA a year ago), with 30 out of the 36 sub-divisions receiving normal or above normal rainfall (Chart III.20a and b). Some of the key rice-producing states, however, received rainfall well below normal \u2013 Uttar Pradesh (-28 per cent), Bihar (-31 per cent), Jharkhand (-21 per cent) and West Bengal (-17 per cent). After lagging in June-July, the area under kharif sowing made a smart recovery in August. As of September 23, 2022, the total kharif sowing area was 1.7 per cent above the normal area (5-year average); it was, however, 1.2 per cent below a year ago due to shortfalls under rice (-5.5 per cent), pulses (-3.9 per cent) and oilseeds (-0.8 per cent) (Chart III.20c). The production weighted rainfall (PRN) index at 100 as on September 23, 2022 was a GVA in agriculture, forestry and fishing posted a growth of 4.5 per cent in Q1:2022-23 (2.2 per cent a tad below its last year\u2019s position (101 per cent) and the PRN for cotton, oilseeds, pulses and coarse cereals exceeded the 5-year average (Chart III.20e and f). As of September 22, 2022, reservoir levels stood at 88 per cent of the full capacity \u2013 above the last year\u2019s 78 per cent as well as above the decadal average of 75 per cent \u2013 brightening the prospects for the upcoming rabi season. According to the first advance estimates (FAE), kharif 2022 foodgrains production is estimated at 1,499.2 lakh tonnes, 3.9 per cent below last year's fourth advance estimates (0.4 per cent below FAE of last year) driven by a decline of 6.1 per cent in rice production (Table III.6). Amongst other crops, cotton and sugarcane output are estimated to be 9.6 per cent and 7.7 per cent above the previous year\u2019s level, while oilseeds output will be 1.3 per cent lower. The government announced an increase of 4.4 \u2013 8.9 per cent in minimum support prices (MSP) for kharif 2022-23 crops, ensuring a return of at least 50 per cent over the cost of production (as measured by A2 plus FL7). The procurement of rice during the kharif marketing season 2021-22 (up to September 26, 2022) at 592.8 lakh tonnes was 0.1 per cent higher over the previous year, contributing to comfortable stocks of rice at 2.6 times the buffer norm (352.9 lakh tonnes), despite the extension of cereals distribution under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY). In the case of wheat, lower domestic production resulted in lower procurement. As on August 31, 2022, #: Lakh bales of 170 kgs each. # #: Lakh bales of 180 kgs each.

Industrial GVA recorded a y-o-y growth of 6.0 per cent in Q1:2022-23 (40.4 per cent in the same period a year ago, driven by base effects). All components expanded y-o-y and surpassed their Q1:2019-20 levels, despite headwinds from higher input costs and global supply chain bottlenecks (Chart III.22). Electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services registered robust growth, supported by revival of industrial activity and normalisation of services. The index of industrial production (IIP) rose by 10.0 per cent, y-o-y, during April-July (4.2 per cent above the pre-pandemic level), supported by all its constituents \u2013 mining, manufacturing and electricity (Chart III.23). The expansion in manufacturing activity was driven by beverages, wearing apparel, furniture, printing and reproduction of recorded media and other transport equipment. In terms of the use-based classification, all categories expanded y-o-y during April-July. The production of capital goods posted double-digit growth, indicative of revival in investment activity. Consumer durables output also rose strongly, benefitting from the recovery in private consumption, especially urban demand. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) improved from 54.4 in Q1 to 56.3 in Q2 (56.4 in July and 56.2 in August) due to a pick-up in sales, and product enhancements, diversification (Chart III.26a). Overall, manufacturing, primary goods, infrastructure & construction and capital goods sectors have Electricity generation rose by 17.6 per cent (y-o-y) in Q1:2022-23 (15.3 per cent above the pre-pandemic level). Thermal and renewable sources expanded by 17.7 per cent and 28.3 per cent, respectively. In Q2 (July-August), overall electricity generation growth moderated to 2.7 per cent, partly due to abundant rainfall (Chart III.24a). Region-wise, electricity demand remained broad-based during H1 (Chart III.24b). The nominal GVA of listed manufacturing companies sustained a healthy expansion on the back of higher profits and staff costs (Chart III.25). According to the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, the manufacturing sector\u2019s optimism waned marginally in Q2:2022-23.

Amongst major sub-sectors, steel consumption, cement production, electricity generation, passenger vehicles and two-wheelers indicate buoyancy and are above their 2019-20 output levels. Services sector GVA rose by 17.5 per cent y-o-y in Q1:2022-23 (2.8 per cent above the pre-pandemic level), supported by sustained recovery in contact- intensive activities, and consumer confidence and business sentiment (Chart III.27a). Trade, hotels, transport, communication, and other services were resuscitated by increased resumption of operations and pent-up demand, but still remained below the pre-pandemic level by 15.5 per cent. improving indicators suggest a continued High frequency broadening activity traction of (Table III.8). GST collections and issuances of e-way bills \u2013 indicators of wholesale and retail trade and underlying overall economic activity \u2013 remained above pre-pandemic levels for the fourteenth straight month in August. Construction sector activity remained healthy in H1, as reflected by cement production and steel consumption, benefitting from government\u2019s continued focus on boosting infrastructure and improving real estate activity (Chart III.27b). Travel and hospitality services recovered in Q1, with increased discretionary spending and pent- up demand. The hotel industry occupancy levels exceeded pre-pandemic levels in May-June 2022 but dipped marginally below July-August. Transportation activity remained robust in H1 \u2013 commercial vehicle sales more than doubled y-o-y in Q1, while railway freight traffic posted a growth of 11.8 per cent in Q1 and 8.1 per cent in Q2 (up to August). Port cargo traffic rose by 9.2 per cent in Q1 and 11.6 per cent in Q2 (up to August) on the back of buoyant international trade (Table III.9). Passenger air traffic expanded by 206.2 per cent in Q1 and 74.1 per cent in Q2 (up to August) on improving tourism as well as business-related travels (Table III.9). Growth in financial, real estate and professional services improved to 9.2 per cent in Q1:2022-23 from 2.3 per cent a year ago, aided by a revival in real estate and the buoyancy in financial services. Bank credit growth accelerated to 16.2 per cent (y-o-y) as on September 9, extending support to financial services. In the real estate sector, new launches reached a 25-quarter high in Q1 and sales were at the highest in 10 quarters but still trailed pre-pandemic levels (Chart III.28a). Housing prices grew by 3.5 per cent (y-o-y) in Q1:2022-23, according to the RBI\u2019s all-India housing price index, led by Chennai and Mumbai PMI: Services (>50 indicates growth over previous month) II Trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting Credit outstanding y-o-y growth (per cent) Bank deposits y-o-y growth (per cent) Life insurance first year premium Note: Bank credit growth since December 3, 2021 is adjusted for past reporting errors by select scheduled commercial banks (SCBs).

Public administration, defence and other services (PADO) increased by 26.3 per cent y-o-y in Q1:2022-23 (6.2 per cent a year ago), aided by other services (education, health, recreation and cultural, etc) even as government consumption recorded muted growth. The PMI services remained in expansion zone in H1. After easing from 58.7 in Q1 to 55.5 in July, it rebounded to 57.2 in August (Chart III.27b). The Composite PMI index was 58.0 in Q1 and 57.4 in Q2 (July-August). Domestic economic activity was in H1:2022-23. Consumer confidence and business optimism propelled discretionary spending, demand for contact-intensive activities, and investment activity. Looking ahead, good progress under kharif sowing, adequate reservoir levels, Government\u2019s continued thrust on capex, improved capacity utilisation in manufacturing, pick-up in non-food credit and waning COVID-19 infections should support aggregate demand and activity in H2. Geopolitical tensions, tightening of global financial markets and global economic slowdown, however, pose downside risks to the domestic outlook. During H1:2022-23, domestic financial markets adjusted smoothly to the shift in monetary policy stance and exhibited resilience to global financial market headwinds and policy spillovers from AEs. Market rates have moved higher and bank credit offtake has improved. Going forward, the RBI will remain vigilant, agile and nimble in its liquidity management operations and would use all instruments at its disposal to mitigate the spillovers of global financial market volatility on domestic financial markets. global financial markets During H1:2022-23, experienced surges of volatility in the cross currents of geopolitical hostilities and aggressive monetary policy actions and stances across jurisdictions to combat elevated inflation pressures. As financial conditions tightened, bond yields hardened and stock markets plunged in H1 as mounting recession fears unnerved investor sentiments. In the currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against major global peers to a 20-year high by early-September, buoyed by the Fed\u2019s front-loaded rate hikes, quantitative tightening, and rising safe haven demand. These developments triggered portfolio outflows from emerging market economies (EMEs) and imposed sharp depreciation pressures on their currencies, exacerbating risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. repo (FRRR) provided initial momentum. On average, the weighted average call rate (WACR) traded 2 basis 8 - September 27), as compared with 2 bps below the firmed up the WACR above the policy repo rate in the auctions mitigated the temporary liquidity stress. average rate (WAR) of traded deals was 18 bps above Domestic financial markets were impacted by global spillovers recurringly, especially in the equities and forex segments. Money markets remained relatively insulated although interest rates hardened in response to the withdrawal of monetary accommodation domestically. Bond yields eased from mid-June highs but hardened intermittently. Money market rates firmed up during H1:2022-23, reflecting policy repo rate increases by the RBI and the reduction in surplus liquidity. The institution of the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate as the floor of the the SDF rate while that of reported deals1 was 30 bps below during H1:2022-23 (April 8 - September 26), reflecting market segmentation as small cooperative banks \u2013 principal lenders in reported deals \u2013 brought in funds at lower rates towards the close of market hours (Chart IV.2a). The average monthly volume of traded deals at `1.39 lakh crore was higher than `1.01 lakh crore in the reported segment (Chart IV.2b). The share of reported deals in the total call money market volume declined to about 34 per cent in September 2022 from 68 per cent in March 2022, due to increased participation by public sector and foreign banks. share of mutual funds (MFs) \u2013 the major lenders in the collateralised segment \u2013 in market repo declined to 46 per cent from 56 per cent, partly because of reduced inflows under debt mutual funds (up to August). MFs\u2019 share in TREPS at 72 per cent in H1 was, however, Money market activity remained dominated by the collateralised segments with the share of the uncollateralised call money market remaining at 2.0 per cent in H1:2022-23 (up to September 27). The share of triparty repo (TREPS) moderated to 73 per cent from 76 per cent a year ago, with a corresponding increase in the share of market repo to 25 per cent from 22 per cent (Chart IV.3). Among investors, the \u2018Traded deals\u2019 are negotiated directly on the NDS-Call platform whereas \u2018reported deals\u2019 are over-the-counter (OTC) deals which are reported on the unchanged. On the borrowing side, the share of public sector banks (PSBs) increased to 66 per cent from 64 per cent in TREPS and to 19 per cent from 16 per cent in market repo over the same period. Interest longer-term money market instruments \u2013 3-month T-bills (TBs), certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercial paper (CPs) \u2013 moved higher during H1:2022-23. The spreads of TBs, CDs and CPs were 51 bps, 72 bps and 87 bps, respectively, above the SDF rate in H1:2022-23 (April 8 - September 26) as against 26 bps, 38 bps and 88 bps, respectively, above the FRRR during H2:2021-22 (Chart IV.4). The issuances of CDs increased to `2.96 lakh crore in H1:2022-23 (up to September 23) from `1.73 lakh crore in H2:2021-22, reflecting banks\u2019 demand for funds to meet the buoyant credit offtake. Mobilisation of resources through the issuances of CPs, however, fell to `7.20 lakh crore during H1:2022-23 (up to September 26) from `10.09 lakh crore in H2:2021-22 (Chart IV.5a), as the appetite for bank credit improved. The weighted average discount rate (WADR) of CP issuances firmed up to 5.50 per cent in H1:2022- 23 from 4.47 per cent in H2:2021-22. Corporates remained the major issuers of CPs, with their share increasing to 60.2 per cent in H1:2022-23 from 53.3 per cent in H2:2021-22 (Chart IV.5b). by 64 bps during Q1, driven by (i) the rise in US yields and crude prices; (ii) the announcement of a larger than anticipated Central Government borrowing auction calendar for H1:2022-23; (iii) higher than expected March and April CPI inflation prints; and (iv) the repo rate hike of 40 bps in an unscheduled meeting in May along with the 50 bps hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) (Box IV.1). Most of the CP issuances were in the 31-90 days maturity segment (Table IV.1). The WADR of issuances in this maturity segment firmed up to 5.45 per cent in H1:2022-23 (up to September 26) from 3.97 per cent in H2:2021-22. During H1:2022-23, G-sec yields exhibited two-way movements (Chart IV.6). The generic 10-yr yield rose In Q2 (up to September 27), the benchmark yield softened by 20 bps owing to the fall in crude prices, lower CPI inflation for July vis-\u00e0-vis June, the return of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) as net buyers in August-September and expectations of India\u2019s likely inclusion in global bond indices. Reflecting these factors, the 10-year yield moderated from its peak of 7.66 per cent (on June 16, 2022) to 7.09 per cent on September 13; it, however, rose to 7.30 per cent on September 27, 2022 reflecting policy rate hikes by major central banks and higher global bond yields. Higher than expected H1 borrowing US FOMC raised rates by 75 bps Efficient financial markets are believed to price in the anticipated component of policy actions. In order to assess the true impact of policy announcements on the market interest rates, it is essential to segregate the surprise element (which the market might not have been able to predict) from the anticipated component of monetary policy (Kuttner, 2001). High frequency financial market variables such as overnight indexed swaps (OIS), futures and stock prices can be used to identify policy surprises (Gertler and Karadi, 2015). Akin to the global evidence, the OIS is found to reliably capture market expectations of the future path of the policy rate in India. Monetary policy surprises are identified by using the change in the 2-month OIS rate (given the bi-monthly policy cycle) on the policy day, while the residual is assumed to be the anticipated policy change. By narrowing the window around the policy announcement day, the change in the OIS rate can be reasonably attributed to monetary policy surprises. The change in the 2-month OIS rate on policy days may also contain a surprise on the path of expected future policy rates provided by the central bank\u2019s forward guidance. This policy surprise is identified by splitting the change in policy rate/monetary policy decision into two parts \u2013 anticipated and unanticipated policy change (eq. 1) (Ahokpossi et al., 2020) \u2013 as follows: where, i is the policy rate, t is the time index and is the market expectation at time t-1 of the policy rate at time is the change in the policy rate which is bifurcated t. into an unanticipated component ( ) and an anticipated portion ( ). The hypothesis that only the unanticipated decisions/surprises may have a significant impact on market rates is put to test for the key markets (91-days Treasury Bills, 10-years G-sec and AAA rated 5-years corporate bonds) in an event study (ES) framework2, using the following specification: change/monetary policy surprise; is the anticipated policy change; D1 to D4 are dummies to capture major policy developments3; refers to the change in refers to Brent crude prices; and the corresponding changes in US rates one day prior to the policy announcement. The empirical analysis indicates that anticipated policy changes are not significant for 10-year government securities and 5-year corporate bonds \u2013 only the surprise element has an impact on the yields of these securities (Table IV.1.1). The cumulative effect at the end of 2 days is higher (and significant) than the same day impact, suggesting that the markets take time to absorb policy is the change in market interest rates is the unanticipated policy Note: Figures in parentheses refer to the Newey-West standard errors (corrected for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation). ***,**,* denote levels of significance at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively.

In the case of treasury bills, while both surprise as well as anticipated policy changes matter, the surprise component is the major driver. Overall, interest rates in money and bond markets in India are found to respond significantly mainly to policy surprises in conformity with the efficient market hypothesis.

Yields on T-bills firmed up across tenors in sync with the increases in the policy repo rate and the introduction of the SDF (Chart IV.7). The dynamics of yield curve movements are captured by its level, slope, and curvature4. While the average level of yields hardened by 64 bps, the slope flattened Average trading volume in both G-secs and T-bills increased year-on-year in H1:2022-23 (up to September 26) (Chart IV.8).

The weighted average coupon (WAC) at 7.15 per cent during H1 (up to September 27) remained higher than 7.11 per cent as at end-March 2022. The weighted average spread of cut-off yields on state government securities (SGS) over G-sec yields of comparable maturities was 32 bps in H1:2022-23 (up Corporate bond yields moved higher in H1, broadly tracking G-sec yields. The average yield on AAA- rated 3-year bonds issued by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and corporates increased by 156 bps (to 7.52 per cent) and by 170 bps (to 7.56 per cent), respectively, in H1:2022-23 (up to September 27). The yield on issuances by public sector undertakings (PSUs), financial institutions (FIs) and banks rose by 143 bps to 7.25 per cent (Chart IV.11a). The average risk premium (measured by spread over 3-year G-sec yields) increased from 35 bps to 41 bps for NBFCs, from 25 bps to 45 bps for corporates while it moderated from 21 bps to 14 bps for PSUs, FIs and banks (Chart IV.11b). The increase in risk premia was seen in other tenors (albeit more at longer segments) and rating spectrum as well (Table IV.2).

Overall, the BSE Sensex declined by 2.5 per cent in H1:2022-23 (up to September 27, 2022) to close at 57,108. Indian equities account for 3.5 per cent of total world market capitalisation, the fifth largest in the world (Chart IV.13b). The India VIX \u2013 which captures the short-term expected volatility of Nifty 50 \u2013 fell from its 20-month high of 32.0 on February 24, 2022 to 21.6 on September 27, 2022 (Chart IV.13c). EMEs as an asset class experienced selling pressures from FPIs in 2022 amidst heightened geopolitical tensions and rapid monetary policy normalisation by global central banks (Chart IV.14a). In India, equity markets witnessed sell-offs for nine consecutive months (October 2021-June 2022), the longest selling streak since 2000. Foreign investors, however, returned to the domestic equity market in July, attracted by the improvement in corporate earnings and strong macro fundamentals. Domestic institutional investors (DIIs) made heavy purchases in the equity market for 17 consecutive months (March 2021-July 2022), absorbing FPI sell-off pressures and enabling the market to outperform global and other emerging market peers. Overall, FPIs were net sellers to the tune of `58,438 crore, while DIIs were net buyers to the tune of `1.3 lakh crore in H1:2022- 23 (Chart IV.14b).

In terms of the 40-currency nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), the INR appreciated by 0.2 per cent between March 2022 and September 23, 2022 (Table IV.3). It also appreciated by 1.1 per cent in terms of the 40-currency real effective exchange rate (REER) during this period. Forward premia declined during H1 reflecting narrowing interest rate differentials on the back of a faster than expected tightening by the US Fed. The one-month forward premium averaged 3.36 per cent during H1 (up to September 27) down from 3.93 per cent during H2:2021-22 (Chart IV.17). During H1:2022-23, bank credit10 growth accelerated in tandem with improving economic activity. Growth in non-food bank credit increased to 16.7 per cent (y-o-y) as on September 9, 2022 from 9.7 per cent as at end-March 2022 (Chart IV.18). Although credit growth (y-o-y) picked up for both public sector banks (PSBs) and private sector banks (PVBs) in H1:2022-23, it remained higher for PVBs (20.4 per cent vis-\u00e0-vis 13.9 per cent for PSBs) (Chart IV.19a). The share of PSBs in total incremental credit extended by all scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) on a y-o-y basis, however, was higher than that of PVBs (Chart IV.19b). 9 Comparison based on data available up to September 16, 2022. 10 Bank credit growth and related variations/ratios for all fortnights since December 3, 2021 are adjusted for past reporting errors by select scheduled commercial banks (SCBs). The improvement in bank credit was seen across all major sectors11 (Chart IV.20). Credit to the agriculture sector grew by 13.4 per cent (y-o-y) in August 2022 (13.0 per cent a year ago), supported by the above- Credit growth to industry recovered to 11.4 cent in August from 1.5 per cent a year ago, led by large 11 Sectoral non-food credit data are based on sector-wise and industry-wise bank credit (SIBC) return, which covers select banks accounting for about 93 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all SCBs. 12 The government raised the agriculture credit target of `16.5 lakh crore for 2021-22 to `18 lakh crore for 2022-23. industry and sustained growth in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) segment. Credit to large industries expanded by 6.4 per cent in August, after remaining in contraction zone for a substantial period, due to higher working capital requirements and industrial activity. The extension of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECGLS) helped push up credit growth in respect of micro and small industries to 28.2 per cent in August 2022 from 12.1 per cent a year ago, with incremental credit (y-o-y) flows to MSMEs exceeding that to large industry (Chart IV.21a and b). Among the major industries, credit growth to the infrastructure sector (accounting for 38.0 per cent of outstanding industrial credit) accelerated to 11.0 per cent in August 2022 from 3.3 per cent a year ago. Credit growth to infrastructure was driven by the power sector, reflecting strong growth in electricity generation (Chart IV.21c and d). After witnessing a slide during the COVID-19 pandemic, services sector credit offtake gained traction in H1:2022-23, led by disbursements to NBFCs (which registered 27.8 per cent growth in August 2022 as against contraction of 1.0 per cent a year ago). Credit growth in contact intensive sectors such as tourism, hotels and restaurants remained broadly stable (Chart IV.22). Retail loans remained the major driver of overall credit growth. Within retail loans, growth in housing loans was sturdy (16.4 per cent in August 2022 as compared b: Growth in Bank Credit to NBFCs with 11.6 per cent a year ago) while vehicle loans strengthened (19.5 per cent in August 2022 vis-\u00e0-vis 11.1 per cent a year ago). Credit card loans bounced back in H1:2022-23 with the ebbing of new COVID-19 infections and the rebound in consumer demand (Chart IV.23). The asset quality of SCBs improved, with the overall non-performing assets (NPA) ratio declining to 5.6 per cent in June 2022 from 7.5 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.24a). Asset quality improved across all the major sectors (Chart IV.24b).

The mandated external benchmark regime introduced in October 2019 for loan pricing in select sectors has strengthened the interest rate channel of monetary transmission. The proportion of outstanding floating rate loans linked to external benchmarks has increased from 9.1 per cent in March 2020 to 46.9 per cent in June 2022. Concurrently, the share of marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) linked loans has come down to 46.5 per cent in June 2022 (Table IV.5). The bulk of external benchmark-based lending rate (EBLR) loans (80 per cent of total in June 2022) are linked to the policy repo rate. Accordingly, banks raised their EBLRs for fresh loans by 140 bps during Banks\u2019 deposit and lending rates moved higher in repo rate beginning May 2022. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned during May-August 2022 increased by 82 bps while Base rate regime MCLR regime External benchmark regime Others that on outstanding rupee loans increased by 41 bps, reversing in part the sizeable moderation in these Note: Data pertain to 74 scheduled commercial banks.

The 1-year median MCLR of SCBs \u2013 which is an internal benchmark \u2013 rose by 70 bps in H1, in line with pressures on their cost of deposits and other funding sources. The increase in the share of EBLR-linked loans, the shorter reset periods of such loans and upward adjustment in MCLRs have increased the pace of transmission to WALR on outstanding loans (Chart IV.27). Across domestic banks, the increase in the WALRs on fresh rupee loans for PSBs exceeded that of PVBs during May-August 2022, partly reflecting the higher share of floating rate loans in the case of the former. During the easing phase also, the pass-through to lending rates of PSBs had exceeded that of PVBs (Chart IV.28 a and b). The lending rates of PSBs Note: 'Other personal loans' include personal loans other than housing, vehicle, education and credit card loans. Source: RBI. remain lower than that of PVBs (Chart IV.28c). The transmission to lending and deposit rates was the maximum in the case of foreign banks, reflecting a higher share of low cost and lower duration wholesale deposits in their total liabilities. The WALRs on both fresh as well as outstanding rupee loans increased across all the sectors during May- August 2022 (Chart IV.29). The spreads charged by domestic banks over the policy repo rate (in the case of floating rate fresh rupee loans where the repo rate is the external benchmark) moderated in case of MSME, housing and education loans in H1:2022-23 (Table IV.6). Banks also raised their term deposit rates H1:2022-23 amidst moderation in systemic liquidity (Chart IV.30a)14. Banks increased their bulk term deposit15 rates more relative to retail deposit rates (Chart IV.30b) - the weighted average domestic term (Chart IV.30c). The transmission to WADTDR on outstanding deposits is also picking up albeit gradually, reflecting the preponderance of term deposits contracted at fixed rates (Table IV.4).

Moreover, it is also a financial stability tool in addition to its role in liquidity management. The MSF rate was retained at 25 bps above the policy repo rate; thus, the width of the LAF corridor was restored to its pre-pandemic level of 50 bps and became symmetrical around the policy repo rate again.

The SDF rate is applicable on uncollateralised overnight deposits. By removing the binding collateral constraint on In H1:2022-23, the focus of liquidity management moved to gradual, calibrated withdrawal of surplus liquidity in a non-disruptive manner. This was in sync with the shift in the focus of monetary policy from remaining accommodative during 2021-22 to withdrawal of accommodation to contain inflationary pressures and anchor inflation expectations. The MPC raised the policy repo rate by 140 bps during May- August 2022. With the institution of the SDF at 40 bps the central bank, the SDF strengthens the operating above the FRRR in April, the cumulative increase in the effective interest rate was 180 bps. Furthermore, the CRR was increased by 50 bps to 4.50 per cent (effective fortnight beginning May 21, 2022), withdrawing primary liquidity from the banking system. Surplus liquidity moderated in H1:2022-23, driven by the public\u2019s currency demand, net forex outflows and the build-up in government\u2019s cash balances. The drainage of liquidity due to expansion in currency in circulation (CiC) in H1 was lower than a year ago, partly reflecting the growing use of digital payments (Chart IV.31). The build-up of government cash balances also contributed to the leakage of liquidity from the banking system. The drawdown by banks of their excess reserves partially ameliorated liquidity pressures (Table IV.8). In terms of management of liquidity by the RBI, OMO sales and the increase in CRR by 50 bps sucked out liquidity from the banking system in H1. The consequent moderation in surplus liquidity was reflected in lower absorptions under the LAF \u2013 LAF fell from `7.8 lakh crore in April to `2.1 lakh rose to `59,312 crore (outstanding amount) on July (iii) GoI Cash Balances [build-up (-) / drawdown (+)] (iv) Excess Reserves [build-up (-) / drawdown (+)] (ii) Required Reserves [including both change in NDTL Outstanding Net LAF as at the end of period 25, 2022, \u2013 the highest since April 1, 2019 (`94,263 crore). Advance tax outflows and GST payments temporarily moderated surplus liquidity in the third week of September. The RBI conducted variable rate repo (VRR) auctions of `50,000 crore each of 3 days and overnight maturity on July 26 and September 22, 2022, respectively.

In view of the moderation in surplus liquidity, banks appetite to park funds with the Reserve Bank for longer maturities waned. Consequently, the amount absorbed through the variable rate reverse repo auctions declined to 40 per cent of the total absorption in September 2022 (up to September 27) from around 74 per cent in March 2022. The effective absorption rate17 at 5.25 per cent in September 2022 (up to September 27) was higher than the SDF rate of 5.15 per cent. Since its inception on April 8, 2022, the monthly average absorption under the SDF has been in the range of `1.2-2.7 lakh crore during H1:2022-23 (up Domestic financial markets have adjusted smoothly to the shift in monetary policy\u2019s focus on withdrawal of accommodation, policy rate hikes and the moderation in surplus liquidity, while exhibiting resilience to global financial market headwinds and policy spillovers from AEs. Market rates have moved higher across the maturity spectrum albeit at varying degrees across market segments and instruments. Bank credit offtake has improved in line with economic activity, even as lending and deposit rates have started moving higher. The foreign exchange market has been characterised by an orderly adjustment of the INR, with a depreciating bias due to the generalised strength of the US dollar. Going forward, the RBI will remain vigilant, agile and nimble in its liquidity management operations and would use all instruments at its disposal to mitigate the spillovers of global financial market volatility on domestic financial markets. 17 The weighted average rate of absorptions under the FRRR/SDF and VRRR of longer maturities with the absorbed amount under each facility being the weights. The global outlook has worsened under the combined impact of the protracted conflict in Ukraine, and aggressive and synchronised monetary tightening. These developments are imparting sizeable volatility to global financial markets and large adverse spillovers to emerging market economies. Supply chain disturbances, the energy and food crises and tightening financial conditions are exacerbating risks of a global recession. The global outlook has worsened since the April 2022 MPR under the combined impact of the protracted war, and aggressive and synchronised monetary tightening to rein in multi-decadal highs in inflation. Sovereign bond yields have hardened while equity markets have corrected in response to monetary policy actions. Geopolitical tensions, the faster pace of monetary tightening by the US Fed, and the safe haven demand have led the US dollar to rally to 20- year highs, imposing depreciation pressures on the currencies of major emerging market economies (EMEs) in an environment of large portfolio outflows. Lingering supply chain disturbances, the energy and food crises and tightening financial conditions are exacerbating risks of a global recession. The Euro area\u2019s GDP grew by 3.1 per cent (q-o-q saar) in Q2:2022, its fastest pace in three quarters, boosted by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and a resurgence in tourism. High frequency indicators for Q3, however, suggest slowdown in momentum due to growing uncertainty surrounding future gas supplies and the rising costs of living. The composite PMI for the Euro zone registered its second consecutive contraction in August 2022 at 48.9, with downturns in both manufacturing and services. The outlook is overcast by the war and perniciously high inflation, with expectations of tighter financial conditions going forward. Global growth lost momentum in Q2:2022. High frequency indicators point to a further slowdown in Q3. The US economy contracted in H1:2022 [(-) 1.6 per cent and (-) 0.6 per cent in Q1 and Q2, respectively, in terms of quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) seasonally adjusted annualised rates (saar)], dragged down by inventories and residential fixed investment (Table V.1). In contrast, the US labour market remains robust, with sustained payroll gains and a low unemployment rate. Nominal wage growth has been strong, albeit with signs of levelling off. The US composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI)1 at 44.6 in August remained in contraction territory for the second consecutive month, with declines in both manufacturing and services output. In the UK, GDP contracted by 0.3 per cent in Q2:2022 (q-o-q saar) due to a fall in government and consumer spending, deceleration in production output and contraction labour shortages. The labour market remains tight with some early signs of weakening in labour demand. The composite PMI plummeted to 49.6 in August 2022, the first contraction in 18 months, driven by severe downturn in manufacturing output and slowdown in services business activity. The Bank of England (BoE) forecasts a decline in GDP in Q3:2022 till the end of 2023 under the adverse impact of the sharp rise in global energy and goods prices on UK households\u2019 real disposable incomes. in services constrained by Japan\u2019s GDP grew by 3.5 per cent (q-o-q saar) in Q2:2022 following a near stagnation in Q1 as private consumption accelerated with the lifting of COVID-19 curbs, and government spending rose 1 The references to PMIs are to S&P Global indices, unless specified otherwise. for the second straight quarter. The employment and income situation improved moderately on the whole, buoyed by accommodative monetary policy. The composite PMI (au Jibun Bank) dropped sharply to 49.4 in August 2022, the first contraction since February, with both manufacturing and services companies recording a decline in output. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) expects growth to be under pressure stemming from elevated commodity prices though the economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualised rate (q-o-q, saar) Amongst EMEs, China's GDP growth decelerated sharply to 0.4 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2022 from 4.8 per cent in Q1, marking the second-worst quarterly growth in 30 years (Table V.1). On q-o-q (annualised) basis, the economy contracted by 10 per cent in Q2:2022 as COVID-related lockdowns curbed economic activity amidst a steep downturn in the real estate sector and an energy crunch. H1:2022 growth at 2.6 per cent (y-o-y) was below the 5.5 per cent annual growth target for 2022. The composite PMI (Caixin) was at 53.0 in August, driven by an expansion in services activity, offset by a marked slowdown in manufacturing growth. Looking ahead, the zero-COVID policy, strained power supply and the liquidity crisis in the real estate sector are likely to weigh on economic activity. Amongst other major EMEs, Brazil\u2019s GDP growth rate accelerated to 3.2 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2022 from 1.7 per cent in Q1, supported by private and government spending, and investment. The unemployment rate fell to a multi-year low in June. The composite PMI eased to 53.2 in August, with notable slowdown evident in both the manufacturing and service sectors. Going forward, tight monetary conditions, high inflation and war-related uncertainty remain key risks to the growth outlook. South Africa\u2019s GDP growth decelerated sharply to 0.2 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2 driven by the devastating floods in the KwaZulu-Natal region and power rationing hampering industrial activity.

Soaring energy prices have helped the external sector hold up relatively well. The economy is expected to contract in both 2022 and 2023 due to the war and sanctions (Table V.2). in the ASEAN3 economies decelerated Growth in Q2:2022 as the war dampened demand. The manufacturing PMI for these economies in August signalled improvement in business conditions as output and new orders expanded and employment and purchasing activity increased. The slowdown in China is a major source of risk to the region due to spillovers from supply disruptions and weaker exports. Amongst high frequency indicators, the OECD composite leading indicators (CLIs) for August 2022 remained below trend for most economies, indicating a deteriorating outlook due to multi- decadal high inflation, low consumer confidence and declining stock price indices (Chart V.1a). The global composite PMI fell from 50.8 in July to 49.3 in August, indicating a contraction in global output for the first time since June 2020, with fall in both services and manufacturing output (Chart V.1b). The moderation in world trade, which started in the third quarter of 2021, accentuated in H1:2022 owing to the war and slowdown in global growth in a worsening macroeconomic environment (Chart V.2a). Reflecting this, the merchandise trade 2 BRICS includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. 3 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam. volume growth slowed from 4.6 per cent in Q1:2022 to 4.3 per cent in Q2:2022; however, it witnessed an uptick in July 2022. The WTO expects trade volume growth to moderate to 3.0 per cent in 2022 from 9.8 per cent in 2021. The Baltic Dry Index, which measures shipping costs for a wide variety of bulk commodities such as coal and iron ore, increased in September 2022 on sequential basis. It was, however, lower by 70.1 per cent from its peak in October 2021, but remained above its pre-COVID Global commodity prices have witnessed large swings since February following the war. Commodity prices initially surged by 14.7 per cent (according to the Bloomberg commodity price index) during March-May 2022 as the war started. Since then (June- September 28, 2022), the prices have corrected by 14.2 per cent as slowing global growth dampened demand. Notwithstanding the Bloomberg commodity price index has gained 13.7 per cent year to date (till September 28) (Chart V.3a). Global food prices, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), eased by 13.6 per cent between March\u2019s all-time record high and August 2022, as seasonal production gained and reduction in restrictive trade policies assuaged supply conditions. The index, however, increased by 3.2 per cent in 2022 (up to August) (Chart V.3b). Crude oil prices were highly volatile in H1:2022. They hovered above US$100 per barrel between April and July due to the war and sanctions related uncertainty in an environment of acutely tight supply conditions (Chart V.3c). Amidst extremely low inventories, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plus countries continued with calibrated changes in production quotas. OPEC plus decided to increase production by 100,000 barrels per day in August 2022 but in September, it decided to curtail production by a similar magnitude starting October. On the back of slowing global demand, strengthening US dollar and expectations on the availability of Iranians supplies, crude oil prices declined sharply during July-September 2022. Nevertheless, Brent crude prices have gained 15.0 per cent year to date (till September 28). Natural gas prices have jumped significantly since the war; in August 2022, the prices (according to World Bank\u2019s natural gas index) increased by 91.7 per cent in 2022 and remained 249.2 per cent higher on year-on-year basis. Base metal prices, measured by Bloomberg\u2019s base metal spot index, which rose by 17.1 per cent on the back of the war, softened by 34.8 per cent between April and September 2022 (up to September 28), reflecting a weak global outlook. Gold prices plummeted markedly since April, hitting a low at US$1,618 per troy ounce in September as bond yields hardened and the US dollar traded stronger. For some metals like zinc and aluminium, production cuts amidst high energy prices have lent support to prices in August. In September, however, prices treaded the downward trajectory following other metal prices (Chart V.3d). Notes: (1) Inflation for US is in terms of year-on-year change in consumer price index with personal consumption expenditure price index year-on-year change in parentheses. inflation ratcheted up across Consumer price economies due to sustained cost push pressures from elevated food and energy prices, rising wage cost and lingering pandemic-induced supply chain bottlenecks as strong rebound in domestic demand in a number of economies added to price pressures. Headline inflation breached inflation targets across AEs and EMEs over the course of 2022 so far (Table V.3). High energy and food prices have been the major drivers of the upsurge in inflation, with goods inflation generally much higher than services, though the latter has also started to gather pace recently. Core inflation is also ruling at elevated levels in many economies due to the interplay of cost-push shocks and demand-pull pressures. In the US, headline CPI inflation reached a 40-year high of 9.1 per cent in June 2022, driven by inflation in energy and food prices. It eased to 8.3 per cent in August due to a fall in gasoline prices. Inflation in (2) The Bank of Canada aims to keep inflation at the 2 per cent mid-point of an inflation control target range of 1-3 per cent.

Core PCE inflation eased to 4.6 per cent in July from 5.2 per cent in March (Chart V.4a). In the Euro area, CPI inflation soared to a historic high of 9.1 per cent in August 2022, prevailing well above the European Central Bank (ECB)\u2019s target of 2 per cent since July 2021. The precipitous increase in energy prices, especially of natural gas, along with food prices, remained the major driver of inflation. Non- energy industrial goods, transportation and fertiliser costs have also fuelled price pressures. CPI inflation in the UK rose to 10.1 per cent in July \u2013 the highest since availability of data in January 1997 \u2013 and well above the BoE\u2019s target of 2 per cent, led by housing and household services, transport and food. It moderated marginally to 9.9 per cent in August as transport sub-index declined. In Japan, CPI inflation in all items less fresh food \u2013 the Bank of Japan\u2019s target measure \u2013 rose to 2.8 per cent in August, the highest in 7 years. It has breached the 2 per cent target since April 2022. CPI inflation also rose to 3.0 per cent in August 2022 from 2.6 per cent in July, amidst surging fuel and food costs as well as a sharply weakening yen. Like the AEs, inflation in major EMEs remains elevated and well above their respective targets. In Brazil, CPI inflation was 8.7 per cent in August 2022 (Chart V.4b). In Russia, inflation peaked at 17.8 per cent in April from 9.2 per cent in February following sanctions and a sharp depreciation of the rouble. It has since then moderated gradually to 14.3 per cent in August, partly due to currency appreciation. In South Africa, CPI inflation stood at 7.6 per cent in August \u2013 exceeding the central bank\u2019s target range since May 2022 \u2013 as prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages increased. In China, CPI inflation has remained subdued, although it accelerated during March-July 2022, mainly due to a surge in food prices and a strong recovery in demand. In August, however, it moderated to 2.5 per cent as both food and non-food indices eased. With inflation rates at their highest in decades and significantly above targets, central banks in AEs and EMEs resorted to aggressive monetary tightening with larger-than-usual rate hikes in 2022 to contain inflation and anchor inflation expectations even as economic activity is losing momentum. A number of central banks in EMEs were already in a tightening mode in 2021. The synchronised monetary tightening has raised concerns as to whether it will lead to a recession or whether the central banks will be able to achieve a soft landing (Box V.1). After initiating the tightening cycle in March 2022, the US Fed has delivered rate hikes in all its subsequent policy meetings. In May, the US Fed effected a 50 bps increase in the federal funds rate. It followed up with 75 bps hikes in its June, July and September meetings \u2013 With inflation rates ruling at their highest since the 1970s and 1980s in major economies and substantially above targets, central banks have stepped up the pace and the quantum of rate hikes to keep inflation expectations anchored and to bring inflation back to targets. This has raised growing concerns that the synchronised monetary tightening could land the global economy into a recession (a hard landing). Central banks hope that they would be able to engineer a soft landing (with only a loss of pace in growth rather than an outright contraction in economic activity) (BIS, 2022; Blinder, 2022). A panel analysis of 8 countries with 23 tightening cycles over the period Q1:1997-Q2:2022 suggests that for both AEs and EMEs, hard landings are preceded by significantly higher average inflation as compared to soft landings4 (Table V.I.1). Low GDP growth in the period prior to the start of tightening increases the probability of a hard landing in AEs. In EMEs, high GDP growth in conjunction with high inflation tilts the scales towards hard landing. For EMEs, elevated fiscal deficits and public debt prior to the start of monetary tightening increase the risk of them ending in recession post the tightening. At the current juncture, inflation is running high while GDP growth is slowing even as unemployment rates remain low. This macroeconomic mix raises the odds of hard landing. Conditions during tightening Tightening duration (quarters) Note: ***,**,* denote level of significance at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively, for testing equality of means between hard and soft landings using Student\u2019s t test. Sources: BIS; Bloomberg; IMF and RBI staff estimates. A formal panel logit regression for the sample of AEs and EMEs indicates that the probability of a hard landing increases if the tightening is preceded by high inflation, high GDP growth and higher increase in credit/GDP ratio; higher real policy rates prior to the start of the tightening episode, on the other hand, appear to reduce the probability of a hard landing by mitigating the build- up of financial excesses (eq. 1).

Figures in parentheses are p-values. 4 Hard landing for the purpose of this analysis is negative GDP growth rate (y-o-y) for 2 or more successive quarters for AEs; for EMEs, it is a fall in GDP growth rate by 60 per cent (or more) for 2 or more successive quarters from the average GDP growth rate over the sample period. A soft landing, on the other hand, is a scenario of no recession within three years of a tightening cycle in which the policy rate is raised for at least three successive quarters and peaks. 5 One year prior to the start of the tightening cycle. 6 Average quarterly change in credit growth during one year preceding the tightening cycle. a cumulative hike of 300 bps in the current tightening phase. It also unveiled plans for quantitative tightening to reduce its balance sheet by US$ 47.5 billion per month during June-August and US$ 95 billion per month from September. According to the Summary of Economic Projections released in September 2022, the median federal funds rate is seen at 4.4 per cent by end\u20132022 and 4.6 per cent by end-2023. Amidst raging inflationary pressures, the ECB in its June 2022 meeting decided to end net asset purchases under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) as of July 1, 2022 while continuing to reinvest maturing securities under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) until atleast the end of 2024. The ECB undertook frontloaded rate hikes of 50 bps in July and 75 bps in September in response to soaring inflation. Continuing with the tightening cycle that started in December 2021, the Bank of England (BoE) raised its policy rate in the May and June 2022 meetings by 25 bps each followed by 50 bps in August and September each which took the Bank Rate to 2.25 per cent. Simultaneously, in September, the committee unanimously voted to reduce around \u00a380 billion in its stock of gilts over twelve months7. Alongside the start of the gilt sales programme, the BoE also decided to launch a new Short Term Repo (STR) facility to help ensure that short-term market rates remain close to the Bank Rate. Other major AEs have also started unwinding their pandemic-led stimulus and normalising their monetary conditions. The Bank of Canada has raised its policy rate by 275 bps since April \u2013 50 bps each in April and June, 100 bps in July and 75 bps in September, along with quantitative tightening to maintain price stability. The Reserve Bank of Australia has increased its cash rate target by 225 bps since May \u2013 25 bps in May and by 50 bps each in June, July, August and September. The Norges Bank and the Bank of Korea raised their policy rates by 175 bps and 150 bps, respectively in 2022 while the Central Bank of Iceland and the Czech National Bank effected cumulative hikes of 350 bps and 325 bps, respectively (Chart V.5a). Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden) has increased the policy rate by 175 bps in 2022 so far, including 100 bps hike in September 2022. Amongst the AEs, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) remained an outlier as it maintained an accommodative stance and kept the monetary policy parameters \u2013 key policy rates and the quantum of asset purchases \u2013 unchanged in 2022 so far. Amongst EMEs, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) adopted an accommodative monetary policy stance effecting 25 bps and 50 bps cuts in the reserve requirement ratio for most banks and smaller banks, respectively, from April 25, 2022, which injected 530 billion yuan into the economy. It reduced the 1-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) by 5 bps in August, the 5-year LPR by 15 bps and the 1-year medium-term lending facility loans and 7-day reverse repurchase agreements by 10 bps each. In contrast, most other EME central banks continued with policy tightening. Amongst BRICS, the Banco Central do Brasil followed up on its 100 bps rate hike action of March with a 100 bps rate hike in May and 50 bps rate hikes each in June and August. It, however, paused its tightening cycle in its September meeting. The South African Reserve Bank raised its policy rate by 50 bps in its May meeting and by 75 bps in both its July and September meetings (Chart V.5b). Amongst Asian EMEs, the Bank of Thailand and the Bank Indonesia embarked on a tightening cycle by hiking 25 bps each in August 2022, followed by a hike of 25 bps and 50 bps, respectively, in September. In Latin America, the central banks of Mexico, Chile and Peru continued with monetary tightening. Amongst European EMEs, Hungary has In light of the significant re-pricing of UK and global financial assets, the BoE announced on September 28 that it would carry out temporary purchases of long-dated UK government bonds on whatever scale necessary to restore orderly market conditions. Concomitantly, the BoE decided to postpone the planned gilt sales under \u00a380 billion stock reduction programme, that were due to commence in early October, to October 31. cumulatively increased the policy rate by 860 bps since April, including 200 bps in an off-cycle meeting The Bank of Russia switched gears in H1 as price and financial stability risks subsided. It had increased its in two steps to stem depreciation and inflationary pressures amidst the geopolitical upheaval. As depreciation pressures waned, it cut its policy rate by Global financial markets remained nervous during April-September as they grappled with protracted geopolitical tensions, the highest inflation rates in decades in many economies, aggressive monetary tightening and global recession concerns. Bond yields have firmed, equity markets have corrected and the US dollar has surged on hawkish Fed statements and safe haven demand while EME currencies broadly weakened. 12.50 percentage points since April \u2013 including by 300 bps each in two off-cycle meetings held in April and May, thus offsetting the rate hikes in February. The central bank of Turkey cut its key policy rate by 100 inflation skyrocketed to 80.2 per cent in August. Overall, during 2022, central banks\u2019 rate hikes have been quite aggressive by historical standards. In a raised their policy rates in 2022 (till September 28, 2022), 23 central banks have raised their policy rates by 75 bps or more. Out of these, 8 central banks raised In equity markets, the US S&P index plunged beginning April 2022 as uncertainty regarding the pace of unwinding by the US Fed along with mounting growth concerns rattled investor sentiments. The short-lived rebound in the first half of June was reversed by September on account of the large rate hikes by the Fed. With some dissipation in uncertainty and falling inflation expectations, US equities gradually rebounded in July but shed gains in August and September as the Fed continued with its aggressive rate hikes. Overall, the US S&P index fell by 17.9 per cent between end- March 2022 and September 28, 2022. European stock markets broadly mirrored the US markets, inching down in April and May on account of mounting recession fears and worries over surging bond yields. After a short reversal in late- May and early-June, markets have been weighed down by rising inflation fears, soaring energy prices, gloomy business activity data and larger rate hikes by the ECB. The UK stock indices also tracked global cues. The Japanese market outperformed its peers on stable inflation and the continuation of ultra-accommodative monetary policy to support economic recovery. However, it fell to a 3-month low in September 28, 2022. of higher rate hikes. Recession concerns pulled down long-term bond yields in July, but yields edged of further monetary tightening. In April, the US 10- year treasury yield raced up to a 3-year high as the market priced in more aggressive Fed tightening than previously anticipated. With short-term rates also rising sharply, the yield curve became flatter. As the growth outlook dimmed and recessionary fears rose, the short end of the yield curve hardened while long-term yields softened, causing yield curve inversion in July. The US 10-year yield, however, hardened again in August-September with stronger- EME stock markets underperformed developed markets in Q2:2022 as growing inflationary pressures, recession fears, and monetary tightening in the major AEs impacted investors\u2019 sentiments (Chart V.6a). In Q3:2022, stock markets, especially for EMEs, posted negative returns with Brazil and India being exceptions. The dash for safe haven led to portfolio outflows and downward pressures on equities (Chart V.6b). The UK and German 10-year bond yields tracked the US markets. The UK 10-year bond yield shot up by 70 bps in the week ending September 28, on account of expansionary fiscal policy involving sweeping tax cuts. Differing from peers, Japanese bond yields were Sovereign bond yields across major AEs hardened in Q2 and Q3 over surging inflation and expectations range bound, given the continued accommodative monetary policy stance.

Rising safe haven demand amidst the ongoing geopolitical upheaval and soaring energy prices have further strengthened the US dollar. The US dollar\u2019s strength was mirrored in the weakening of EME currencies amidst ebbing investor interest. Capital outflows during March-July exacerbated the volatility in EME currencies. Capital flows resumed in August but the trend reversed in September led by equity outflows (Chart V.8b). The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index declined by 4.4 per cent in Q2:2022 and by 5.4 per cent in Q3:2022 (up to September 28, 2022). The risks the global growth outlook are overwhelmingly tilted to the downside as monetary authorities undertake aggressive tightening to rein in high inflation. The uncertainty around the war and the pace of monetary tightening going ahead are imparting sizeable volatility to global financial markets, while also lending safe haven demand to the US dollar. These developments are generating large adverse spillovers to emerging market economies and posing sizeable downside risks to their growth prospects.

Equity markets have seen sharp corrections since the start of the calendar year with the market volatility index rising to a one-year high amidst geopolitical tensions. Currency markets have turned highly volatile in response to these developments, with the US dollar index reaching its highest since June 2020 due to \ufb02ight to safety. Brent crude prices crossed US$ 130 per barrel on March 8, 2022 and have hovered in the US$ 100-120 range since mid-March, posing the biggest risk to India\u2019s economic prospects and putting the global recovery at heightened risk. The Bloomberg commodity index spiked by around 10 per cent since the war erupted on February 24 and 52 per cent on a year-on-year basis (as on April 5, 2022) as supply concerns exacerbated across commodities. Gold prices crossed US$ 2,000 per ounce on safe haven demand before some correction. Global food prices were at an all-time high in February 2022 and are expected to harden further in view of potential supply disruptions. With in\ufb02ation turning out to be persistent and broad-based and well above targets, major advanced economies (AEs) quickened the pace of unwinding of their ultra-accommodative monetary policies. A number of emerging market economies (EMEs) have been in a tightening mode since 2021, and more are expected to follow. Sovereign bond yields in major Turning to the domestic economy, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.9 per cent in 2021-22, above its pre-pandemic (2019-20) level by just 1.8 per cent. Economic activity, which gained strength in Q2:2021- 22 (July-September) with the ebbing of the second wave, has lost pace since Q3:2021-22 (October- December), exacerbated by the spread of the Omicron variant in Q4 (January-March). The bene\ufb01cial effects of the rapid ebb of infections have, however, been overwhelmed by the geopolitical con\ufb02agration since February 2022. Consumer price index (CPI) in\ufb02ation edged above the upper tolerance band in February 2022 as unfavourable base effects combine with the onset of supply shocks as con\ufb02ict escalates. While India\u2019s direct trade and \ufb01nancial exposures are modest, indirect spillovers from the slowing global economy, the sharp jump in commodity prices across the board and elevated risk aversion and uncertainty owing to geopolitical developments weigh heavily on the outlook. During October 2021-March 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met thrice. When the MPC met for its October 2021 meeting, CPI in\ufb02ation had returned within the tolerance band after breaching the upper threshold in May-June 2021. The outlook for aggregate demand was progressively improving but output was still below the pre-COVID level and the recovery was uneven. The external environment had turned uncertain and challenging, with headwinds from slowing growth in major economies, a steep jump in natural gas prices and concerns emanating from normalisation of monetary policy in major advanced economies. Against this backdrop, the MPC noted that the domestic recovery needed to be nurtured assiduously through all policy channels and decided unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and by a majority of 5 to 1 to continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that in\ufb02ation remains within the target going forward. In its December 2021 meeting, the MPC noted that continuing the normalisation of excise duties and value added taxes (VATs) on petroleum products alongside measures to address other input cost pressures assumed critical importance for a sustained lowering of core in\ufb02ation. The domestic recovery was gaining traction but was just about catching up with pre-pandemic levels and downside risks remained signi\ufb01cant, rendering the outlook highly uncertain, especially on account of global spillovers, the potential resurgence in COVID-19 infections with new mutations, persisting shortages and bottlenecks and the widening divergences in policy actions and stances across the world. Against this backdrop, the MPC judged that the ongoing domestic recovery needed sustained policy support to make it more broad-based and decided unanimously to maintain status quo on the policy repo rate and with a majority of 5 to 1 to continue with the accommodative stance set out in the October resolution. At the time of MPC\u2019s February 2022 meeting, CPI in\ufb02ation had edged even higher, driven up by unfavourable base effects while demand-pull pressures remained muted. The MPC noted that in\ufb02ation was likely to moderate in H1:2022-23 and move closer to the target thereafter, providing room to remain accommodative. The potential pick up of input costs was seen as a contingent risk, especially if international crude oil prices remained elevated. On economic activity, the MPC observed that COVID-19 continued to impart some uncertainty to the future outlook while the global macroeconomic environment was characterised by deceleration in global demand, with increasing headwinds from \ufb01nancial market volatility induced by monetary policy normalisation. Judging the domestic recovery was still incomplete and needed continued policy support, the MPC decided unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and on a 5 to 1 majority to continue with the accommodative stance. The MPC\u2019s voting pattern re\ufb02ects the diversity in individual members\u2019 assessments, expectations and policy preferences, a characteristic also re\ufb02ected in voting patterns of other central banks (Table I.1). Chapters analyse macroeconomic developments related to in\ufb02ation and economic activity during H2:2021-22 (October-March). For the updated projections set out in this Chapter, the evolution of key macroeconomic and \ufb01nancial variables over the past six months warrants revisions in the baseline assumptions (Table I.2). First, international crude oil prices have surged over the past six months. Crude oil prices initially declined in late November 2021 in the wake of the Omicron wave and the expected reduction in demand; since then, global crude oil prices have been on the rise as demand increased with the ebbing of Omicron infections while supply remained sluggish due to the chronic under-performance versus targets by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plus, a subdued shale response, multi-year low oil inventories, dwindling spare capacity and Russia- Ukraine developments (Chart I.1). The outlook has become highly uncertain due to escalating geopolitical tensions and sanctions, even as the US has decided to release about 180 million barrels of oil from its stockpile in a bid to cool crude prices. Taking into account these developments, crude prices (Indian basket) are assumed at US$ 100 per barrel in the baseline, 33 per cent above the October MPR baseline. Second, the nominal exchange rate (the Indian rupee or INR vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar) has exhibited two-way movements in a range of INR 74-77 per US dollar since October 2021. The INR exhibited a depreciating bias till the middle of December 2021 over concerns Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. about the economic fallout from the Omicron wave, elevated crude oil prices, and expectations of faster rate hikes by the US Fed. Subsequently, as the Omicron caseloads declined sharply, the INR showed signs of appreciation. The INR came under pressure from late February due to geopolitical tensions and the surge in crude oil prices. Taking these developments into consideration, the exchange rate is assumed at INR 76 per US dollar in the baseline as against INR 74.3 in the October 2021 MPR. Third, the global economic prospects have weakened signi\ufb01cantly since the October MPR, with a sequence of headwinds from the Omicron wave, prolonged global supply chain disruptions, persistent container shortages, multi-decadal in\ufb02ation highs in major advanced economies forcing their central banks to quicken the pace of monetary policy normalisation and more recently by the escalating geopolitical tensions (Chart I.2). According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the rise in commodity prices and \ufb01nancial market volatility since the ratcheting up of the geopolitical tensions in February, if sustained, could reduce global GDP growth by over one percentage point in the \ufb01rst year and push up global consumer price in\ufb02ation by around 2.5 percentage points; the output losses could be higher in case of further sanctions, consumer and business boycotts, disruptions to shipping and air traf\ufb01c, the unavailability of key products from Russia, trade restrictions such as export bans on food commodities, and undermined consumer con\ufb01dence.1 In March, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) projected global growth for 2022 to be 100 bps below its October 2021 assessment.2 Note: IMF data are aggregated on purchasing power parity weights and UNCTAD data are on market exchange rates; the respective months of projections are in parentheses.

After easing to 4.3 per cent in September 2021, CPI in\ufb02ation rose in the following months to reach 6.1 per cent in February 2022, driven by the increase in food in\ufb02ation. Looking ahead, the three months and one year ahead median in\ufb02ation expectations of urban households increased marginally by 10 bps each in the March 2022 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey.3 The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate also increased for both the three months and one year ahead horizons vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round (Chart I.3). Manufacturing \ufb01rms polled in the January-March 2022 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expected increase in their input costs and selling prices in Q1:2022-23 (Chart I.4a).4 Service and infrastructure sector companies expected moderation in the pace of increase in input costs and selling prices in Q1:2022-23 (Charts I.4b and I.4c).5 The respondents Note: Net response is the difference between the share of respondents reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism. The range is -100 to 100. A positive/ negative value of net response is considered as optimistic/pessimistic from the view point of respondent \ufb01rms. Therefore, higher positive values of selling prices indicate increase in output prices while lower values for the cost of raw materials/cost of inputs indicate higher input price pressures and vice versa. 3 The Reserve Bank\u2019s in\ufb02ation expectations survey of households is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 (18 cities in previous rounds) and the results of the March 2022 round are based on responses from 6,033 households. 4 The results of the January-March 2022 round of the industrial outlook survey are based on responses from 1,283 companies. 5 Based on 574 companies polled in the January-March 2022 round of the services and infrastructure outlook survey. Credit growth of scheduled commercial banks Combined gross \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit (per cent of GDP) in manufacturing and services PMI reported continued input and output price pressures in March 2022. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in March 2022 expected CPI in\ufb02ation to move from 6.1 per cent in Q4:2021-22 to 5.8 per cent in Q1:2022-23, 5.9 per cent in Q2, 5.4 per cent in Q3 and 5.2 per cent in Q4 (Chart I.5 and Table I.3).6 One- year ahead in\ufb02ation expectations of professional forecasters are anchored around the in\ufb02ation target, @: Second advance estimates, National Statistical Of\ufb01ce.

In\ufb02ation expectations of \ufb01rms and households are a key the hypothesis \u2013 assesses directly whether in\ufb02ation determinant of actual in\ufb02ation dynamics. Two facets of expectations are anchored at the in\ufb02ation target (equation the degree of anchoring of in\ufb02ation expectations can be 3 below). Drawing upon this conceptual framework, empirically examined \u2013 shock and level anchoring (Ball an empirical analysis is undertaken for 4-quarter ahead would imply that transitory supply-side shocks and period October 2016 to February 2022.

In equation 3, (the degree of alignment with the target) is expected to be positive and statistically signi\ufb01cant for level-anchored expectations, with closeness to unity indicative of the degree of anchoring. The results indicate that expectations of professional forecasters are shock-anchored (full sample as well as pre-pandemic period), i.e., they are not in\ufb02uenced by food and fuel price shocks (Tables I.1.1 and I.1.2).

A comparison of the regressions of households for the full period and the pre-pandemic period (Tables I.1.1 and I.1.2) indicates a reduction in the coef\ufb01cients on food and fuel in\ufb02ation as well as on in\ufb02ation surprises in the extended sample, suggesting reduced sensitivity of their expectations to shocks. An upward bias in households\u2019 in\ufb02ation expectations is observed in other countries as well (Chart I.1.1.b). The co-movement of households\u2019 in\ufb02ation expectations with actual in\ufb02ation appears to be in consonance with the cross-country experience with expectations responding more to an increase in prices Looking ahead, the record foodgrains production in 2021-22, ample foodgrains buffer stocks and the government\u2019s supply side interventions augur well for food in\ufb02ation in 2022-23 on the assumption of a normal monsoon. Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys, estimates from structural and other time-series models, and crude oil (Indian basket) at US$ 100 per barrel in 2022-23, CPI in\ufb02ation is projected to average 5.7 per cent in 2022-23 \u2013 6.3 per cent in Q1, 5.8 per cent in Q2, 5.4 per cent in Q3, and 5.1 per cent in Q4 (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent con\ufb01dence intervals for headline in\ufb02ation in Q4:2022-23 are 3.4-6.8 per cent and 2.5-7.7 per cent, in global commodity prices due to global demand weakening more than expected and an easing of geopolitical tensions. Economic activity which was recovering with the ebbing of the third wave, rapid stride towards universal vaccination, and supportive \ufb01scal and monetary policies now faces signi\ufb01cant headwinds from the exacerbating geopolitical developments and the accompanying sharp rise in global commodity prices and weakening global growth outlook.

The thick red shaded area represents 50 per cent con\ufb01dence interval, implying that there is 50 per cent probability that the actual outcome will be within the range given by the thick red shaded area.

For 2023-24, assuming a progressive normalisation of supply chains, a normal monsoon and no further exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that in\ufb02ation will move in a range of 4.6-5.7 per cent. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent con\ufb01dence intervals for Q4:2023-24 are 3.8-7.2 per cent and 2.9-8.1 per cent, respectively. Turning to the key messages from forward-looking surveys, the consumer con\ufb01dence (the current situation index) rose in the March 2022 survey round, although it remained in the pessimistic zone. For the year ahead, consumers\u2019 optimism strengthened further on the back of improved sentiments on the general economic situation, employment and household income (Chart I.7).8 There are a number of upside and downside risks to the baseline in\ufb02ation forecasts. The upside risks emanate from a further hardening of global crude and other commodity prices due to geopolitical tensions, longer-than-expected supply chain disruptions, a larger pass-through of input cost pressures to output prices in the event of stronger demand conditions and global \ufb01nancial market volatility from a quicker- than-expected normalisation of monetary policy by the advanced economies. The downside risks arise from an early mending of supply chain disruptions, a muted pass-through to output prices and a correction 8 The Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer con\ufb01dence survey is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 (13 cities in the previous rounds) and the results of the March 2022 round are based on responses from 5,984 respondents. Optimism in the manufacturing sector for the quarter ahead moderated marginally in the January-March 2022 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey due to an ebb in sentiments on inventory of raw materials and \ufb01nished goods (Chart I.8a). Services and infrastructure sectors also reported lower optimism on the overall business situation in Q1:2022-23 (Charts I.8b and I.8c). Recent surveys by other agencies indicate a sequential moderation in business expectations (Table I.4). According to the PMI surveys, one year ahead business expectations of \ufb01rms in the manufacturing sector moderated while those of \ufb01rms in the services sector remained steady in March 2022. Professional forecasters polled in the March 2022 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey expected real GDP growth at 3.9 per cent in Q4:2021-22, 14.0 per cent in Q1:2022-23 (due to favourable base effects), 6.4 per Notes: 1.

For 2023-24, assuming a normal monsoon, and no major exogenous or policy shocks, the structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 6.3 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 5.9-6.8 per cent. There are upside and downside risks to the baseline growth path. Upside risks to the baseline trajectory could emanate sustained expansion in domestic demand, including for contact- intensive services, a boost to private investment activity from the con\ufb02uence of government\u2019s thrust on capital expenditure, and healthier corporate balance sheets (Chapter III). On the contrary, the Note: The fan chart depicts uncertainty around the baseline projection path. The baseline projections are conditioned upon the assumptions set out in Table I.2.

This section explores plausible alternative scenarios to The global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is turning out to be muted relative to earlier expectations. Downside risks to even this subdued recovery have the escalation of geopolitical tensions, which have led to a broad-based increase in global commodity prices and are expected to have a large negative impact on global trade and growth. Even as the share of Russia and Ukraine in global economy is modest, they are among the major global suppliers of key commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, fertilisers, wheat, corn, and metals. A more protracted con\ufb02ict, extended sanctions, sustained further hardening of global commodity prices and prolonged supply bottlenecks could push global growth well below the baseline. Recurrent waves of COVID-19 infections amidst new mutants of the virus, uneven vaccination progress across countries, and a sharper and deeper tightening of monetary policy by major AE central banks to anchor in\ufb02ation expectations impose further downside risks to the global outlook. In such a scenario, if global growth is 100 bps lower than the baseline, domestic growth and in\ufb02ation could be around 40 bps and 20 bps, respectively, below the baseline trajectories; however, the jump in crude oil prices due to geopolitical tensions, as discussed later, would harden domestic in\ufb02ation. Conversely, an early easing of geopolitical tensions, growing vaccination coverage across countries, a more even distribution of vaccines towards low-income countries, a faster easing of supply chain disruptions and a more gradual withdrawal of monetary accommodation by the major AEs could provide a boost to economic activity. In this scenario, assuming that global growth surprises by 100 bps on the upside, domestic growth and in\ufb02ation could edge higher by around 40 bps and 20 bps, respectively, over the baseline (Charts I.11a and I.12a). International crude oil prices have risen sharply, driven by sudden and overwhelming disruptions caused by war, strong demand and a less than proportionate expansion in output by the OPEC plus. While future prices and the medium-term outlook for supplies suggest a correction in crude oil prices in the months ahead, this could easily be overwhelmed by the fallout of the con\ufb02ict. The outlook poses sizeable risks on either side for a net energy importer like India. An escalation of geopolitical tensions and further drawdown of global inventories amidst OPEC plus production continuing to lag demand could harden international crude oil prices even further and US$ 150 per barrel could easily be tested. Assuming crude oil price to be 10 per cent above the baseline of US$ 100 per barrel, domestic in\ufb02ation and growth could be higher by around 30 bps and weaker by around 20 bps, respectively, over the baseline. Conversely, crude oil prices could soften below the baseline due to a faster resolution of geopolitical tensions, release of emergency stockpiles, a stronger shale production response, and global demand becoming subdued owing to renewed waves of the virus. As a result, if the Indian basket of crude prices falls by 10 per cent relative to the baseline, in\ufb02ation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 20 bps to growth (Charts I.11a and I.12a). Crude oil prices impact growth and in\ufb02ation through multiple channels. First, international crude prices have a direct impact on in\ufb02ation, given the weights of petrol and diesel in the CPI basket, which wear off in a year. Second, indirect effects through cost push and higher in\ufb02ation expectations could push up headline in\ufb02ation in the medium run. Third, higher trade and current account de\ufb01cits in the balance of payments can exert downward impact on the INR exchange rate, adding to in\ufb02ationary pressures. On the output side, higher petroleum prices act as a negative terms of trade shock to the economy, reduce the consumption of non-oil items of households and lower pro\ufb01t margins of \ufb01rms, cash \ufb02ows and investment. The consequent moderation in aggregate demand helps to offset some of the in\ufb02ationary pressures. On net, in\ufb02ation increases and might attract a monetary policy response (Chart I.13). The impact of crude oil prices on domestic in\ufb02ation and output is also conditional on the initial level of crude oil prices in view of the retail petroleum product prices containing speci\ufb01c (non-ad valorem) elements such as excise duty and re\ufb01ning costs which do not co-move with crude oil prices. Therefore, the higher the initial level of crude oil prices, the higher Note: Charts show the impact of 10 per cent increase in crude oil prices (at US$ 100/bbl).

Looking ahead, the protracted geopolitical tensions, the heightened volatility in global \ufb01nancial markets, elevated global sovereign bond yields on the back of more than currently anticipated monetary policy tightening in major AEs, and new COVID-19 mutations could lead to a broader risk aversion towards EME assets and net capital out\ufb02ows. Such developments can put downward pressure on the INR. Should the INR depreciate by 5 per cent from the baseline, in\ufb02ation could edge up by around 20 bps while GDP growth could be higher by around 15 bps through increased net exports; the exchange rate pass- through to in\ufb02ation can, however, be non-linear and time-varying in an environment of high volatility in \ufb01nancial and commodity markets (Patra et al, 2018).9 On the other hand, given that India is among the fastest growing large economies with relatively better growth outlook, strong capital \ufb02ows led by foreign baseline, in\ufb02ation and GDP growth could moderate by Food in\ufb02ation has risen in recent months, largely due to adverse base effects. The expected seasonal correction seems to be getting backloaded. Going stocks of cereals, easing of supply chain bottlenecks soften food in\ufb02ation more than anticipated, and Conversely, hardening global food prices due to lead to upward pressures on food prices and raise any deviations in the actual outturn on either side as well as unseasonal rains would be a critical factor for the food as well as headline in\ufb02ation trajectory (Charts I.11b and I.12b). Economic activity was recovering from the ebbing of the Omicron wave when the fallout of the Ukraine- Russia con\ufb02ict has overcast the near-term outlook with heightened uncertainties. Growth and in\ufb02ation outcomes are at high risk across the world as well as in India. In the face of this extraordinary risk, the positive effects expected from the release of pent- up demand, especially for contact-intensive services, the government\u2019s thrust on infrastructure and capital expenditure, congenial \ufb01nancial conditions and improving capacity utilisation appear ephemeral. Updated forecasts indicate that headline in\ufb02ation, which was expected to ease from current elevated levels as food in\ufb02ation gets contained on the back of record production and abundant stocks, is now subject to a large geopolitical shock. The escalation of war, continued supply chain disruptions, global \ufb01nancial market volatility emanating from monetary policy normalisation in major advanced economies and the evolving COVID-19 trajectory pose downside risks to growth and upside risks to the in\ufb02ation outlook and could get exacerbated signi\ufb01cantly by the intensi\ufb01cation of geopolitical tensions. The concomitant surge in global oil and commodity prices to multi-year highs has increased risk aversion as re\ufb02ected in jumps in \ufb01nancial market volatility and these developments could increasingly shape the economic prospects globally and for India. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation remained volatile during September 2021 to February 2022. After moderating close to the target rate in September, headline CPI inflaiton rose sequentially to the upper tolerance threshold during January-February 2022 mirroring the movements in food inflation, even as fuel inflation remained elevated and core inflation sticky. Costs of farm and non-farm inputs remained elevated. Growth in nominal rural wages for both agricultural and non-agricultural labourers as well as staff costs in the organised sector remained contained. Since the publication of the October 2021 MPR, headline two-way movements \u2013 first, it moderated close to the target at 4.3 per cent in September 2021; thereafter, it moved up sequentially to the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent in January 2022, breaching it at 6.1 per cent in February. The movements in headline inflation mirrored the sharp movements in food inflation, which oscillated between a low of 1.6 per cent in September 2021 and a peak of 5.9 per cent in February 2022. A combination of transitory supply dislocation shocks, elevated import price pressures and unfavourable base effects drove the surge in inflation1 has registered food inflation. With international petroleum product prices on an unrelenting upward trajectory, fuel group inflation remained in double digits during September to December, moderating a little to 9.3 per cent in January 2022 and further to 8.7 per cent in February. Core inflation2 has remained elevated, sticking close to the upper tolerance threshold of 6.0 per cent as cost-push pressures impacted both manufactures and services (Chart II.1). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections, if any, and explain the underlying reasons thereof. The October 2021 MPR projected inflation Note: The imputed CPI prints for April and May 2020 have been regarded as a break in the CPI series.

Actual inflation outcomes were higher than projections by around 50 bps in Q3, but the gap narrowed to 20 bps in Q4 (Chart II.2). The overshoot in Q3 was primarily on account of vegetables prices shooting up disproportionately and falling out of alignment with projections in the months of October-November 2021 as a result of crop damage from heavy unseasonal rainfall. In addition, crude oil prices, which were assumed to be at US$ 75 per barrel during H2:2021-22, averaged US$ 82 per barrel in October itself, pushing domestic pump prices to the then historic high levels3 by the beginning of November. Subsequent reductions in excise duties and State value-added taxes (VATs) in early November led to a reduction in pump prices. Thereafter, barring tax cuts, pump prices remained unchanged in rest of Q3 even as crude oil prices moderated. In Q4 (up to February 2022), actual outcomes have turned out to be closer to projections, in some vegetable as the seasonal correction prices materialised as anticipated; but it turned out to be shallower, resulting in the overshoot over projections. Moreover, cereal prices were provided some upside, by rising export unit values \u2013 India is the world\u2019s largest exporter of rice; it has also exported 19.1 million tonnes of rice during April 2021 to February 2022. The sequential rise in CPI inflation from September 2021 was initially driven up by a pick-up in price momentum, followed by adverse base effects even as price momentum declined.4 In October and November 2021, price momentum increased across food and core categories, but this was couched by favourable base effects in food prices. With the winter setting in, a sharp correction in food prices caused the price momentum to decline in December 2021, but this was more than offset by large unfavourable base effects, resulting in headline inflation hardening by 75 basis points. In January 2022, the decline in food price momentum deepened, but adverse base effects pushed up headline inflation to 6.0 per cent. In February, the CPI headline price momentum turned positive on price pressures from fuel and core categories even though the food price momentum remained negative (Chart II.3). The distribution of CPI inflation during the financial year reveals a high dispersion of inflation rates in the CPI basket, with a considerable positive skew co-existing with a sharp rise in volatility. The large positive skew reflected outliers \u2013 oils and fats, fuel and transport \u2013 which registered inflation in double digits. The increase in volatility reflected surges and sharp deflation in vegetables prices 3 Retail selling price (RSP) for petrol was at ` 110.76 per litre on November 2, 2021 and for diesel, the RSP was at ` 102.30 per litre on November 1, 2021, based on the average RSPs of Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) in the four major metros (Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai). 4 A change in CPI year-on-year (y-o-y) inflation between any two months is the difference between the current month-on-month (m-o-m) change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details, see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. d: CPI excluding Food and Fuel Note: The y-o-y inflation for April and May 2021 have been calculated based on the imputed index for April and May 2020 released by NSO. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. (Chart II.4). Diffusion indices increased sharply during January-February 2022 across goods and services, indicating a broadening of price pressures (Chart II.5).5 A historical decomposition of inflation using vector autoregression (VAR) estimates6, to ascertain the various macro-factors that drove inflation dynamics, indicate that the inflationary pressures in H2:2021-22 can be attributed mainly to adverse cost-push factors, coming from supply-side shocks in food and fuel prices, even as weak aggregate demand conditions continued to exert downward pressure on inflation (Chart II.6a). 5 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. A reading above 50 for the diffusion index signals a broad expansion or generalisation of price increases and a reading below 50 signals broad-based price decline. 6 Historical decomposition estimates the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period (Q4:2010-11 to Q4:2021-22) based on a vector autoregression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 crude oil prices; exchange rate (INR per US$), asset price (BSE Sensex), CPI; the output gap; rural wages; the policy repo rate; and money supply (M3). All variables other than policy repo rate are growth rates. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et; where et represents a vector of shocks. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. Note: The period 2020-21 refers to June-March. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. The pick-up in inflation since September 2021 was driven largely by goods inflation, particularly perishables such as vegetables (non-durable goods with a 7-day recall7). The contribution of semi-perishable goods (non-durable goods with a 30-day recall) edged up till October, but declined thereafter, reflecting primarily the movement in petroleum products inflation (Chart II.6b). Durable goods inflation has transmitted heightened cost-push pressures in the manufacturing sector. 7 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Under MMRP, data are collected on expenditure incurred for frequently purchased items \u2013 edible oil, eggs, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, spices, beverages, processed foods, pan, tobacco and intoxicants \u2013 during the last seven days; for clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods, during the last 365 days; and for all other food, fuel and light, miscellaneous goods and services including non-institutional medical services, rents and taxes, data relate to the last 30 days. Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI. metals, edible oil and petroleum products led to imported components to headline declines during November 2021 to January 2022 have not proved sufficient to meaningfully offset the sustained price increases seen in the earlier part of the year, resulting in the price build-up remaining much above historical averages (Chart II.8). December contributed to lower imported inflation. import duties helped in containing the contribution of domestically generated basket) inflation rose steadily between September 2021 and February 2022. The food price build-up in 2021-22 (up to February) was higher than historical patterns, driven by vegetable and edible oil prices Prices of cereals (weight of 9.7 per cent in headline CPI and 21.1 per cent in the CPI food and beverages group), on a year-on-year basis, emerged out of eight months of deflation in October 2021 and reached 4.0 per cent in February 2022. Within cereals, wheat prices have increased sharply since September on higher exports (336.8 per cent y-o-y increase during April 2021-January 2022) and larger procurement. The increase in production (1.6 per cent as per 2021-22 second advance estimate (AE) over 2020-21 final estimates (FE), ample buffer stocks (1.5 times the buffer norms as on March 16, 2022) and free distribution under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) helped contain inflation. In the case of rice, prices remained relatively stable, as the pick-up in exports (by 28.2 per cent y-o-y during April 2021-January 2022) was supported by higher production (2.9 per cent as per 2021-22 2nd AE over 2020-21) and buffer stocks (7.5 times the norm). experienced lower food price build-ups (Chart II.7a group) were in deflation under the weight of large started receding from December, but adverse base effects drove up inflation in this category to 6.1 per cent in February 2022 (Chart II.9). induced crop damage. Vegetables prices, however, Among the inflation-sensitive vegetables, onion prices hardened during October-November 2021 on account of damages to the stored rabi crop in Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI- food and beverages. prices also escalated during October-November 2021 on account of unseasonal rains. Fresh crop arrivals and ample stocks in cold storages have, however, kept price pressures subdued in subsequent months. Tomato prices also picked up sharply during the same period due to delay in arrivals on account of erratic rains in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, coupled with supply shortages because of heavy rains in major producing states \u2014 Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. Note: Item level data were not released by NSO for the months of March, April and May 2020. Source: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. Maharashtra and Gujarat from cyclone Tauktae in May 2021, followed by damages to kharif crops due to heavy rains in major producing states. Subsequently, prices softened as a result of effective supply side interventions \u2013 2.1 lakh tonnes of onion were released under the price stabilisation fund (PSF) scheme and exports were reduced ((-) 8.5 per cent y-o-y during April 2021-January 2022). Potato Inflation in prices of fruits (weight of 2.9 per cent in the headline CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages group) moderated from a three-year high of 11.8 per cent in May 2021 to 2.3 per cent in February 2022, owing to decline in prices of bananas and apples, with apple production higher by 7.1 per cent in 2021-22 (1st AE) over 2020-21 (FE). during record The (2nd AE) has 2021-22 at 269.6 significantly augmented availability. The higher stock-to-use (STU) ratio at end-March 2022 over last March is reflective of improved supply conditions (Chart II.10). Supply-side measures such as moving imports of tur, urad and moong from restricted to \u2018free category\u2019 from May 15, 2021; removing import duty on masur and reducing Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) to 10 per cent from July 27, 2021; releasing masur from buffer stocks at discounted price; higher imports of pulses (1.9 per cent y-o-y during April 2021-January 2022); and open market intervention by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) helped to keep pulses price inflation (weight of 2.4 per cent in the CPI and 5.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) on a moderating trajectory since September 2021. As regards to animal-based protein items, prices declined in the case of meat and fish (weight of 3.6 per cent in the CPI and 7.9 per cent within the food and beverages group) largely during September 2021-January 2022, primarily reflecting easing feed costs with the import of 12 lakh tonnes of genetically modified soya meal and gradual normalisation of supplies. Prices increased in February 2022 due to winter demand. In the case of eggs, price pressures set in during November 2021-January 2022 and eased in February in accordance with the usual seasonal pattern. Inflation in milk and products gradually increased to 4.1 per cent in January 2022, before easing to 3.8 per cent in February 2022 on favourable base effects, due to successive upward revisions in milk prices by milk co-operatives in various states after July 2021, following the increase in prices by around `2 per litre by major milk co-operatives like Amul and Mother Dairy. Inflation in prices of oils and fats (weight of 3.6 per cent in the CPI and 7.8 per cent within the food and beverages group) continued to rule in double digits since September 2021 albeit with some moderation on the back of supply-side measures and improved prospects for the rabi crop (rabi oilseeds production was higher by 9.1 per cent as per 2nd AE 2021-22) and moderation in international prices of edible oils (Chart II.11). Some important steps taken to ebb price pressures include imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oilseeds pan India, except for six states (Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh which imposed their own stock limit order) up to June 30, 2022, and significant reduction in import duty in a gradual manner on palm oil, soyabean oil and sunflower oil. Overall, during the period from October 2021 to February 2022, the effective import duty on the three major imported crude edible oils, viz. palm oil, soyabean oil and sunflower oil, was reduced by 19.25 percentage points to a weighted average of 5.5 per cent. During the same period, the effective import duty of RBD palmolein/ RBD palm oil and refined soyabean/ sunflower oil was also reduced by 22.0 percentage points and 16.5 percentage points, respectively, to 13.75 and 19.25 per cent. Prices of sugar and confectionery (weight of 1.4 per cent in the CPI and 3.0 per cent in the food and beverages group) emerged out of deflation in September 2021 and averaged 5.2 per cent during September 2021 to February 2022, reflecting, higher 2022, as per DGCIS), the government\u2019s enhanced cent earlier) and adverse base effects. Prices declined cooked snacks as increased input costs fed through. For non-alcoholic beverages, tea prices rose on lower production and higher consumption. In the case of spices, price pressures emerged since December 2021 on account of production shortfalls. of domestic production season, coupled with the decision to extend the sale of unsold sugar quota of Among other food items, prices hardened in the case of prepared meals, driven by cooked meals and The retail price margin8, defined as the difference of retail and wholesale prices, for cereals, pulses, and edible oil remained elevated till March 2022. On the other hand, margins in the case of vegetables softened, particularly for tomatoes, as per the seasonal pattern, but remained higher than in the past (Chart II.12). Item level retail and wholesale prices are aggregated at respective subgroup using item level CPI weights. Data for January-March 2021 have been excluded due to changes in price collection mechanism and item varieties by DCA. The Russia-Ukraine conflict poses considerable upside risks to prices of key food items. Even as adverse spillovers through direct trade remain limited (Chapter III), the Russia-Ukraine war may have a significant impact on inflation through the global commodity markets channel (Chapter V). In the case of edible oils, the loss of supplies of sunflower oil from Black Sea region is likely to keep domestic prices under pressure. The Black Sea region accounts for around 75 per cent of global production of sunflower oil and is a key supplier to India. The situation is being compounded by the tightness in global soybean market and the increase in export levies as well as export restrictions by key producing countries. On the other hand, the significant increase in domestic mustard production is likely to provide some cushion to the price pressures. inflation moderated sequentially to 8.7 per cent in February 2022, enabled by the abrupt slip in electricity prices to deflation since November and LPG prices remaining unchanged since October 2021. Kerosene prices moderated during December 2021-January 2022, reflecting the fall in international prices. In February, as international prices picked up and pass-through became evident, domestic prices also registered a sharp increase. LPG prices were also increased by `50 per cylinder on March 22, 2022. Core inflation, i.e., CPI inflation excluding food and fuel, remained elevated at around 6 per cent in 2021-22 as relentless cost-push pressures impinged on goods and services selling prices (Table II.1). Russia and Ukraine account for about a quarter of global wheat exports. Since the beginning of the Ukraine war, international wheat prices have soared. India is not an importer of wheat, but exports from India have picked up sharply in the current year (336.8 per cent y-o-y during April 2021-January 2022). Therefore, international prices could set a floor for domestic wheat prices through the export channel, even if domestic prices do not move in sync with global prices. However, ample stocks along with a bumper production may help to keep any price increase range bound. Fuel inflation surged from 12.9 per cent in August 2021 to 13.6 per cent in September and further to 14.3 per cent in October, reaching new peaks in these three consecutive months (Chart II.13a). The key driver of this pick-up was the sharp rise in international prices of kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and its transmission to domestic prices (Chart II.13b and c). From November, fuel Exclusion based measures CPI excluding food and fuel (47.3) CPI excluding food fuel petrol diesel (45.0) CPI excluding food fuel petrol diesel gold silver (43.8) Note: (1) Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI.

Domestic prices of LPG are Core inflation was sticky and higher than in the pre- COVID period during 2021-22, with elevated core price pressures coexisting with significantly lower volatility than a year ago (Chart II.14). 2020-21 (June 2020 to March 20219) shows that core goods as well as core services inflation were higher in barring housing and education, were higher than in to health, remained the key drivers, as in 2020-21. 9 The inflation prints of April and May 2020 were not available due to country-wide lockdown.

Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. overall core inflation edged up sharply in 2021-22, the contribution of personal care and effects declined (Chart II.15). prices to domestic pump prices, petrol and diesel retail selling prices have registered a cumulative increase of around `10 per litre in 14 revisions so far (till April 6, 2022). A key source of core inflationary pressures during September 2021 to February 2022 has been petrol and diesel. Some softening since November was facilitated by the cut in central excise duties on petrol by `5 per litre and on diesel by `10 per litre on November 4, 2021 along with a reduction in State VATs in petrol and/or diesel by 28 States/ UTs during November-December 2021. As a result, pump prices scaled down from historic highs recorded during November 1-3, 2021. However, Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) after adjusting for the tax cuts kept the retail selling prices unchanged till the third week of March, even as international crude oil prices exhibited two-way movement \u2013 a moderation during December 2021 before reversing course since early January 2022 and a precipitous rise from end-February on Russia-Ukraine conflict (Chart II.16). Since March 22, with OMCs commencing the pass-through of high international crude oil Various measures of core inflation have remained elevated in a range of 5.0-6.2 per cent during II.1). September Decomposing CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver into its goods and services components points to contrasting movements. Inflation in the goods component (with a weight of 20.7 per cent in the headline CPI) increased consecutively from August 2020, reaching 7.0 per cent in November 2021 and plateauing thereafter. This was driven primarily by clothing and footwear \u2013 readymade garments and uniforms; health care goods \u2014medicines, household toiletries goods and personal care (Chart II.17a). On the other hand, services inflation (with a weight of 23.0 per cent in the headline CPI) which was at 4.5 per cent in August 2021, softened to 4.2 per cent in October before firming up to 4.7 per cent during December 2021-February 2022 Note: International petrol and diesel prices denote the spot price of Singapore gasoline and gasoil, respectively. Domestic petrol and diesel prices represent the average pump prices of four metros as reported by Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). Sources: PPAC; NSO; Ministry of Commerce and Industry; and RBI staff estimates. (Chart II.17b). The pick-up in services inflation was on account of the transport and communication sub- group, coming from an increase in mobile telephone charges during December 2021-January 2022. The contribution of household services (which includes domestic servant/cook/sweeper charges, monthly Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. maintenance charges) and recreation and amusement services (cinema; club; hotel lodging charges) also increased during this period. The contribution of services to core inflation continued to remain lower, on an average, than what was seen in the pre-pandemic period, particularly on account of relatively subdued growth in house rentals (Chart II.15). In order to filter noise out of CPI inflation, two common approaches are (i) excluding a fixed set of components from the CPI basket that display volatile price movements, and (ii) excluding different components each month if they are located in the tails of the inflation distribution. The exclusion- based measures show high and persistent inflationary pressures during September 2021-February 2022 (Table II.1). Inflation measured by trimmed means also edged up during this period (Table II.2). Inflation measured by sectoral CPIs for agricultural labourers (CPI-AL) and rural labourers (CPI-RL) has persisted below CPI headline inflation for the past 20 months. By February 2022, however, the extent of divergence gradually narrowed. Both food and fuel inflation were generally lower in the CPI-AL and CPI- RL vis-\u00e0-vis CPI, resulting in lower inflation prints. Inflation in terms of the CPI for industrial workers (CPI-IW) has moved broadly in line with the headline CPI during September to January 2022. In February 2022, however, there was a substantial divergence on account of lower food inflation in CPI-IW vis-\u00e0-vis headline CPI. 5% trimmed 10% trimmed 25% trimmed WPI inflation, which was in double digits since the start of 2021-22, edged up further since September 2021, reaching an all-time high of 14.9 per cent (as per the WPI series, 2011-12=100) in November 2021. A sharp and broad-based surge in price momentum, despite strong favourable base effects, drove the pick-up in WPI inflation. Persistently high WPI core10 inflation, which remained in double digits from May to December 2021, reflected high commodity and input price pressures as well as supply-side disruptions. WPI inflation moderated somewhat to 14.3 per cent and further to 13.0 per cent in December 2021 and January 2022, respectively, before picking up marginally to 13.1 per cent in February 2022. In line with WPI inflation, the deflators for gross value added (GVA) and gross domestic product (GDP) remained elevated between Q1:2021-22 to Q3:2021-22. In H2:2021-22, WPI and CPI inflation have diverged markedly (Chart II.18a). During September 2021 Note: For Q4:2021-22, the implicit GDP and GVA deflators were used. to February 2022, all the major subgroups of WPI, namely, food, fuel and excluding food and fuel (core) remained substantially above the corresponding subgroups in the CPI. Year-on-year growth in prices of petrol and diesel diverged considerably between CPI and WPI (Chart II.18b) as the CPI, which records prices inclusive of taxes, moderated following the reduction in excise duties and State VATs in November- December 2021. Among food sub-groups, fruits and eggs registered higher price increases on a y-o-y basis in the WPI relative to the CPI. In the WPI, vegetable inflation remained elevated whereas in the CPI, prices of vegetables recorded deflation during September- December 2021, before turning up. Costs, as measured by WPI inflation in industrial raw materials and farm inputs, remained elevated during H2:2021-22 (Chart II.19). Disruptions in global supply chain in the form of logistics bottlenecks, increase in shipping costs, and longer delivery times resulted in input cost pressures. The firming up of global crude oil prices was the main factor that impacted the prices of industrial inputs such as naphtha, aviation turbine fuel, bitumen, petroleum coke and furnace oil. They also contributed to double-digit inflation in high-speed diesel, which in turn drove up farm input price inflation. Other contributory factors comprise fertiliser prices that edged up in sympathy with international prices, and prices of some non-food articles that remained in double digits \u2013 raw cotton and oilseeds. Price of electricity \u2013 a key input in both industrial and farm inputs \u2013 also increased sharply during the period in line with revival in demand. Inflation in industrial raw materials and farm inputs, however, eased during December 2021-January 2022 on account of softer prices of petroleum products but picked up again in aluminium and nickel prices rising to highest level in the last decade. Russia is one of the largest producers of aluminium, widely used in transportation and construction industry, and of nickel, mostly used for high grade steel manufacturing and in batteries. Further geopolitical tension in the region is likely to aggravate global chip shortage and could impact prices of vehicles and electronic products. February 2022 amidst rising international prices and heightened geopolitical uncertainties. The ongoing conflict in the Black Sea region and ensuing sanctions have hampered global supply chains and have also sent prices soaring with Nominal rural wages for both agricultural and non- agricultural labourers picked up during H2:2021-22, with easing of restrictions/lockdowns imposed by states and restoration in economic activity. However, the wage growth remained soft (Chart II.20). In the organised sector, staff cost growth (y-o-y) for both manufacturing and services picked up in Q1 of 2021-22 but decelerated for manufacturing and remained steady for services in the next two quarters, with softer momentum in Q2 and Q3. Unit labour costs also moderated in Q3:2021-22 owing to the sharp increase in growth in value of production of the listed firms both in manufacturing and services Note: Unit labour cost =Staff cost/value of production. The staff cost growth (y-o-y) is based on common set of companies. Sources: Capitaline database; and RBI staff estimates. and transportation costs. However, the pace of output Manufacturing firms polled for the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) reported a sustained increase in input prices in March 2022. Also, the PMI services sector reported continued increase in input prices till March 2022 with firm momentum, mainly driven by so far remained modest as compared to input prices, reflecting restricted pass-through amidst firms\u2019 Input cost prices have been rising during 2021-22, though its pass-through to output prices has remained muted in view of the continuing slack in demand (Patra, 2022). The In the Indian context, PMI price indices have significant predictive power about changes in wholesale price inflation (WPI) (Khundrakpam and George, 2013) 11. gap between input and output prices has remained wide during 2021-22 (Chart II.1.1). In advanced economies like the United States and the Euro area, pricing power of firms has increased significantly against intense pressures from elevated input prices and in the presence of strong Granger causality tests using monthly data from January 2011 to February 2022 confirm that PMI input prices do influence output prices and core CPI, a measure of inflation exclusive of volatile components i.e., food and fuel, with no evidence of reverse causality12. To further examine the strength of the relationship, ordinary least 11 Studies in the US have successfully used PMI price indices, along with other variables, to forecast inflation (Banerjee and Marcellino, 2006; and Wright, 2008). 12 The null of no causality is rejected for PMI input prices to output prices and input prices to core CPI at 5 per cent level of significance. While for the former it holds from first lag to higher lags of input prices, significance reduces for higher lags for input prices to core CPI.

The pass-through is, however, less than complete, reflecting, inter alia, the role of other demand side factors.

Accordingly, OLS is adopted for PMI input to output prices while controlling for the activity parameter, ARDL model is adopted for PMI Input prices to Core CPI. 14 The future output index of composite PMI is used as an indicator of expected demand. 15 Industrial Outlook Survey; and Services and Infrastructure Outlook Survey.

Input cost pressures remained elevated for manufacturing, services and infrastructure firms during Q3 and Q4:2021-22. During Q1:2022-23, manufacturing input costs are expected to remain elevated while some moderation in pace of increase may occur for services and infrastructure firms. Manufacturing firms may charge higher selling prices in Q1:2022-23, vis-\u00e0-vis their services and infrastructure sector counterparts (Chart II.22). One year ahead business inflation expectations16 polled by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, rose sequentially, crossing 6 per cent in February 2022. The businesses polled in the survey reported further heightening of cost pressures, which along with weak demand conditions impacted profit margins of the sampled firms. Recent geopolitical events have accentuated upside risks to inflation. Global supply shocks are still unfolding and their ambit across commodities is widening. Input costs, including energy costs, for various manufacturing goods and services are also likely to go up. The impact of recent events will also be conditioned by the outlook for aggregate demand going forward. Persistent commodity price pressures along with the resurgence of global supply chain and logistics disruptions pose risk of their pass-through to domestic inflation. Though the pass-through so far has been limited due to weak demand conditions, going forward it may need to be monitored carefully. The headroom available for supply side measures remain critical to limit the extent of transmission of adverse cost conditions onto retail prices of goods and services. 16 The monthly Business Inflation Expectations Survey (BIES) of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, polls a panel of business leaders primarily from the manufacturing sector about their inflation expectations in the short and medium term. The latest survey pertains to February 2022 round based on the responses of around 1,000 companies. The recovery in aggregate demand lost some momentum in H2:2021-22 with the emergence of the Omicron variant. External demand remained buoyant. The intensification of geopolitical tensions, the surge in global oil and commodity prices to multi-year highs and intense financial market volatility pose significant downside risks to global economic activity and could have spillovers on domestic growth prospects. The recovery in aggregate demand that had resumed with the ebbing of the second wave of the pandemic lost some momentum in H2:2021-22 with the emergence of the Omicron variant. Although more transmissible, the third wave turned out to be less severe and short-lived relative to the second wave (Chart III.1). As a result, GDP in H2 is estimated to be higher by 6.8 per cent than the corresponding pre-pandemic levels, with the demand for contact- intensive in December 2021-January 2022 and the informal sector and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) still lagging. External demand, on the other hand, remained buoyant, with merchandise exports clocking double- digit growth for the thirteenth month in a row in the aggregate supply side, March 2022.

In contrast, agriculture and allied activities remained buoyant on the back of a record kharif production and expansion in sowing acreage in the rabi season relative to a year ago. its major constituents surpassed their pre-pandemic levels, as recovery gained traction. With the fast ebbing services also recovered in February-March 2022. For the \ufb01nancial year 2021-22, real GDP is estimated to have risen by 8.9 per cent, taking its level 1.8 per cent above that recorded in 2019-20. Aggregate demand, measured by real gross domestic product (GDP), decelerated to 5.4 per cent year-on-year were the key drivers of aggregate demand in H2 Notes: 1. #-Implicit growth. 2.

The October 2021 Monetary Policy Report (MPR) had projected real GDP growth at 7.9 per cent for Q2:2021-22, 6.8 per cent for Q3 and 6.1 per cent for Q4. Actual growth in Q2 overshot the projection by 60 basis points (bps) while it undershot the projection by 140 bps in Q3 (Chart III.3). These upside and downside surprises stemmed mainly from a stronger than expected release of pent-up demand and a pick- up in investment on the back of government capex in Q2, followed by a loss of momentum in Q3. Data for Q4:2021-22 are scheduled for release by the NSO on May 31, 2022. Private \ufb01nal consumption expenditure (PFCE) \u2013 the mainstay of aggregate demand \u2013 regained some traction, but its share in overall GDP dropped to 56.6 per cent in 2021-22 from 57.3 per cent in the previous year, weighed down by incomplete recovery in the labour force participation rate, the third wave and weak consumer con\ufb01dence (Box III.1). The sluggish recovery in the informal sector and among MSMEs also restrained private consumption. Expanding Income, wealth, in\ufb02ation, interest rate and consumer con\ufb01dence are potential determinants of private consumption (Singh, 2012; Vihri\u00e4l\u00e4, 2017; Wong, 2017; Dossche, et. al., 2018). According to unit root tests, private consumption and income (real GDP) are non-stationary1. For the pre-pandemic period, i.e., 2004-19, quarterly data indicate a long-run co-integrating relationship between real private consumption and income2. The short-run error-correction dynamics points to the role of the cyclical factors \u2013 lower interest rates and lower in\ufb02ation support consumption demand, attesting to a role of accommodative monetary policy. Going ahead, given the long-run relationship, consumption can be expected to recover with rising incomes.

ARDL(3,2) model is selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion, vaccination coverage, and relaxation of restrictions on mobility and activity enabled a recovery in demand for contact-intensive services such as air travel, hotels and restaurants, recreation and culture in February- March 2022. Urban consumption was lifted by a recuperation in domestic air passenger traf\ufb01c, especially during February-March, and a moderation in the contraction of passenger vehicle sales that had been hit by shortages in respect of semi-conductor chips (Chart III.4). Consumer durables production, on the other hand, fell in Q3 and January due to subdued discretionary spending. As regards rural demand, sales of two-wheelers recorded y-o-y contraction during H2, indicative of pressures on discretionary household spending and slow recovery in the informal sector. Tractor sales were lower during November-February partly due to protracted and heavy precipitation in some areas. Fertiliser sales also remained lower during January- February, re\ufb02ecting inventory de-stocking and lower imports amidst rising international prices. Consumer non-durables production, on the other hand, rebounded in January 2022 (Chart III.5). Consumer pyramids household survey data of the CMIE show that the labour force participation rate (LFPR) fell from 40.9 per cent in December to 39.5 per cent in March 2022; the unemployment rate, however, dropped from 7.9 per cent to 7.6 per cent over the same period and remained lower than the levels recorded during the \ufb01rst and second waves (Chart III.6a). Employment conditions improved in Q3 and January in the organised sector (Chart III.6b). Gross \ufb01xed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by 14.6 per cent in 2021-22 on the back of a favourable base (-10.4 per cent in 2020-21) and its share in GDP rose marginally to 32.0 per cent as against 31.8 per cent in 2019-20. In H2, however, investment activity weakened, driven down by sluggish construction activity (re\ufb02ected in steel consumption and cement production) due to unseasonal rains, rising input costs and shortage of manpower (Chart III.7). The domestic production of capital goods slipped into contraction Note: Data for Q3:2021-22 are based on results of 1,701 listed private manufacturing companies and 717 listed non-\ufb01nancial services companies. Source: RBI staff estimates. in Q3:2021-22 and January 2022, weighing on overall investment activity, even as imports of capital goods expanded during Q3 and Q4. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector recovered to 72.4 per cent in Q3:2021-22 from 68.3 per cent in the previous quarter (72.2 per cent from 68.6 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis) (Chart III.8); it reached the pre-pandemic levels, although it was below the long-period average. The interest coverage ratio (ICR)3 of listed non- \ufb01nancial private companies in the manufacturing and information technology (IT) sectors remained steady in Q3:2021-22 (Chart III.9). Stronger corporate balance sheets \u2013 comfortable ICR and deleveraging \u2013 can be expected to support capacity expansion further (Box III.2). Under the production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme, the government approved a programme of `2.3 lakh A revival in the investment cycle is vital for ensuring a durable recovery. Despite congenial \ufb01nancial conditions and a strengthening of corporate balance sheets \u2013 moderation in listed \ufb01rms\u2019 leverage in terms of debt/asset and debt/equity ratios \u2013 private investment remains weak in India (Chart III.2.1). Using a panel data of a common set of 1,054 listed non- government non-\ufb01nancial (NGNF) companies over the past twenty half year periods (H2:2011-12 to H1:2021-22), it is observed that \ufb01rm-speci\ufb01c factors \u2013 leverage (measured by either debt to total assets or debt to equity); demand conditions (own sales); internal resources and funding costs (own cash \ufb02ows and effective cost of borrowings); and size of the \ufb01rm have diverse effects on investment. Leverage exerts a negative impact on \ufb01xed investment, while demand in terms of own sales and cash \ufb02ows has a positive effect (Table III.2.1). The cost of borrowings dampens investment, and \ufb01rm size has a negative impact on capacity expansion (i.e., the small- Interest coverage ratio is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expenses and measures a company\u2019s capacity to make interest Notes: Investment growth calculated as half-yearly annualised growth in gross \ufb01xed assets; Debt to total assets and debt to equity calculated as total borrowings scaled by total assets and book value of equity respectively.

The gross domestic saving rate fell to 28.2 per cent in 2020-21 from 29.9 per cent of GDP in 2019-20, dampened by increased dissaving of the government due to a rise in spending to ameliorate the stress of the pandemic (Chart III.10). Net household \ufb01nancial saving inched up to 11.6 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 from 8.0 per cent in 2019-20, driven by the pandemic- induced forced as well as precautionary savings. With the investment rate declining from 30.7 per cent of GDP to 27.3 per cent, the saving-investment gap turned positive in 2020-21 (for the \ufb01rst time since 2004-05), mirrored in a current account surplus recorded in the balance of payments. Net household \ufb01nancial saving rate fell to 10.7 per cent in H1:2021-22 from 14.1 per cent in the same period of 2020-21. consumption The pace of government \ufb01nal expenditure (GFCE) moderated in Q3 on a y-o-y basis due to adverse base effects. Government capital spending, on the other hand, surged in Q3, re\ufb02ecting the push to infrastructure (Chart III.11). During 2021-22, the \ufb01scal position of the Central Government strengthened (Table III.2 and Chart III.12). The centre\u2019s net tax revenue increased by 21.8 per cent during April-February 2021-22. Corporate tax collections jumped by 61.3 per cent, supported by strong corporate performance while customs duties collections rose by 46.6 per cent on increased imports. Excise duty collections, however, rose relatively modestly by 5.4 per cent, owing to the cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel in November.

The central government\u2019s revenue expenditure excluding interest and subsidy payments is budgeted to fall to 7.5 per cent in 2022-23 \u2013 back to the pre- pandemic position \u2013 from 8.1 per cent of GDP in 2021-22 (Table III.2). Capital expenditure increased to 2.5 per cent in 2021-22 from 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 and is budgeted to rise further to 2.9 per cent in 2022-23, re\ufb02ecting the government\u2019s emphasis on public infrastructure such as road transport, railways. The centre\u2019s market borrowing programme for 2021-22 remained at elevated levels for the second successive year (Table III.4). Ample surplus liquidity, open market operations (OMO), including the secondary market government securities acquisition programme (GSAP), facilitated the completion of the borrowing calendar in a non-disruptive manner at a weighted average cost of 6.28 per cent in 2021- 22 (5.79 per cent in 2020-21). The weighted average maturity of the central government issuances was further elongated to a record 16.99 years in 2021- 22 from 14.49 years during 2020-21. States\u2019 gross borrowings of `7.02 lakh crore were completed at a weighted average cost of 6.97 per cent during 2021- 22 (6.52 per cent in 2020-21). The Union Budget 2022-23 has placed gross market borrowings at `14.95 lakh crore (44.2 per cent above the previous year). Taking into account the switch operations conducted on January 28, 2022, the gross market borrowings through dated securities for 2022- 23 are estimated at `14.31 lakh crore. In H1:2022-23, gross market borrowings of the central government through dated securities have been planned at `8.45 lakh crore, 59.0 per cent of the estimated gross borrowing for the year. The central government has been provided ways and means advances (WMA) limit of `1.50 lakh crore for H1:2022-23 for bridging short- term mismatches between receipts and payments. The WMA limit for state governments has been \ufb01xed at `47,010 crore with effect from April 1, 2022. Merchandise exports and imports remained buoyant in H2:2021-22. With the expansion in imports outpacing exports, the trade de\ufb01cit widened in H2. Exports at US$ 40.4 billion touched a new record in March 2022 and remained above US$ 30 billion for the thirteenth consecutive month (Chart III.13). During 2021-22, merchandise exports at US$ 417.8 billion crossed the target of US$ 400 billion. Merchandise exports were driven by engineering goods, petroleum products, chemicals, gems and jewellery, cotton textiles, and electronic goods (Chart III.14a and b). Ready-made garments, primarily labour- intensive, also contributed positively, reversing the losses observed during April-September 2021. Exports from the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) contribute around 30 per cent to India\u2019s total exports. The Union Budget 2022-23 proposal to replace the Special Economic Zone Act with new legislation is expected to further enhance SEZ exports through ef\ufb01ciency gains from more effective leveraging of the existing infrastructure, reduction in the compliance burden and integration of the SEZs and customs administration. The free trade agreement boost India\u2019s labour-intensive exports such as gems and Trade Agreement (ECTA) with Australia provides preferential access to India on 100 per cent of Australian tariff lines and is expected to double the bilateral trade to almost US$ 50 billion in \ufb01ve years. regions. The recently signed Economic Cooperation Merchandise imports reached an all-time high of US$ 60.3 billion in December 2021 and remained above US$ 50 billion for the seventh consecutive month in March 2022. During H2:2021-22, oil imports (US$ terms) were higher by 38.5 per cent over the corresponding pre-pandemic period; in volume terms, however, oil imports were still below the pre- pandemic levels. After registering a robust growth for three consecutive quarters, gold imports posted decelerated growth in Q3:2021-22 but contracted during Q4 as festival demand waned (Chart III.15a). The rise in non-oil non-gold imports during H2 was led by electronic goods, coal, coke and briquettes and chemicals (Chart III.15b). The trade de\ufb01cit widened to US$ 118.2 billion in H2:2021-22 from US$ 76.3 billion a year ago. In the context of the recent geopolitical developments, India\u2019s merchandise exports to Russia and Ukraine are only 0.8 per cent and 0.1 per cent of total exports while the corresponding import shares are 1.5 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively (Table III.5). The direct spillovers from Russia-Ukraine developments on India\u2019s overall merchandise trade and output are thus expected to be limited although the indirect channels \u2013 global slowdown, surge in commodity prices, risk aversion and \ufb01nancial market volatility \u2013 could have a more sizeable impact.

Accretions under non-resident deposit accounts moderated to US$ 1.0 billion during H2 (October-January) from US$ 3.1 billion a year ago. As on March 31, 2022, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 607.3 billion, equivalent to 12 months of merchandise imports in 2021-22 or 98.8 per cent of outstanding external debt at end-December 2021. Growth in gross value added (GVA) moderated to 4.4 per cent in H2:2021-22 from 13.0 per cent in H1. Overall, GVA expanded by 8.3 per cent in 2021-22 and exceeded its 2019-20 level by 3.1 per cent (Table III.6).

As on March 31, 2022, the overall procurement of rice touched 503.42 lakh tonnes which is 8.2 per cent higher than a year ago. Buffer stocks remained above the norms \u2013 571.6 lakh tonnes for rice (7.5 times the norm) and 212.7 lakh tonnes for wheat (1.5 times the norm) at mid-March 2022, notwithstanding the offtake of 365.7 lakh tonnes of cereals (April- February 2021) for COVID-19 relief (mainly the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, PM-GKAY) (Chart III.19). Allied activities \u2013 livestock, forestry and \ufb01shing \u2013 impart substantial resilience to the agricultural sector as a whole. Though allied activities have a share of around 45 per cent in the overall GVA of the sector, their contribution to growth in aggregate agricultural GVA for 2020-21 was higher at 68 per cent (Chart III.18). High-frequency indicators of the rural economy suggest a mixed picture during H2 (Table III.8). Agriculture and allied exports and agriculture credit registered robust growth in H2. Demand for jobs under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) was lower than a year ago due to higher rabi sowing, although it was still above pre-pandemic levels.

While overall manufacturing activity in H2 remained above 2019-20 levels, the production of two-wheelers and passenger vehicles trailed pre-pandemic levels due to the persistence of supply shortages as well as subdued demand (Table III.9). Services sector activity grew by 5.7 per cent in H2 and crossed its pre-pandemic level (8.0 per cent over 2019-20). The contact-intensive services, viz., trade, hotels, transport, and communication inched towards normalisation, though their rebound was held back by the Omicron variant. Construction activity contracted in H2 due to unseasonal rains in Q3 (Chart III.25). Among its proximate indicators, \ufb01nished steel consumption contracted in Q3 as well as Q4, while cement production rose in December-February after a temporary setback in November (Chart III.7c and d). Collections under the goods and services tax (GST) and issuance of E-way bills in Q4 point towards further normalisation of domestic trading activity (Table III.10). After a rebound in Q3, domestic air traf\ufb01c moderated in January due to the spread of the Omicron variant; however, it picked up again from February as infections receded.

Communication services also performed well in Q3, driven by pandemic-induced digitisation. The services PMI rose sharply to 53.6 in March from 51.8 in the preceding month on improving demand conditions and relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions (Chart III.24b). The PMI composite output index also improved to 54.3 in March from 53.5 in February. The IT sector exhibited steady growth in Q3, supported by sustained domestic and international demand, as noted earlier. Non-IT services also recorded robust growth in sales, with the gradual pick-up in contact- intensive services (Chart III.26). Note: Data for Q3:2021-22 are based on results of 1,701 listed private manufacturing companies and 717 listed non-\ufb01nancial services companies. Source: RBI staff estimates. Real estate activity improved in Q3, with higher new launches and sales on the back of low mortgage rates and improving affordability; the inventory overhang also declined, albeit marginally III.27a). Housing prices inched up in Q3:2021-22, led by Kochi, Ahmedabad, Jaipur and Mumbai (Chart III.27b). Public administration, defence and other services (PADO) maintained robust expansion in H2. Amidst subdued growth in central government revenue expenditure, private services appear to have been the main driver of PADO in Q3. Centre\u2019s revenue expenditure excluding interest payments and subsidies rose by 44.2 per cent (y-o-y) during January-February. The thrust of the government on capital expenditure and infrastructure development, and manufacturing activities through the PLI scheme should give an impetus to private investment activity, which would also bene\ufb01t from the improving capacity utilisation, stronger corporate balance sheets and conducive \ufb01nancial conditions. The intensi\ufb01cation of geopolitical tensions following the Russia-Ukraine high \ufb01nancial market volatility pose signi\ufb01cant have spillovers on domestic growth prospects. The uncertainty associated with the pace of monetary would also weigh on domestic industry. During H2:2021-22, domestic financial markets remained relatively stable amidst surplus liquidity conditions with intermittent bouts of volatility caused by several factors such as Omicron\u2019s outbreak, faster pace of monetary policy normalisation in advanced countries, domestic inflation, government borrowing programme, geopolitical conflict and the sympathetic jump in crude oil prices. Going forward, the RBI\u2019s market operations will contextually factor in the developments in global markets to insulate domestic financial markets from spillovers. Since the October 2021 MPR, global \ufb01nancial markets experienced dramatic swings from buoyancy in the \ufb01rst half of Q3 (October-December 2021) to a whirlpool of volatility amidst heightened uncertainties over the Omicron variant and imminent tapering of asset purchases and rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and other leading central banks. During Q4, the sharp escalation of geopolitical tensions in late February culminating in military intervention in Ukraine stunned global markets across asset classes. Global oil and commodity prices spiked to multi- year highs, equity markets in a number of advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) experienced sharp declines, sovereign bond yields in major AEs fell with \ufb02ights to safety \u2013 partly reversing the earlier hardening over in\ufb02ation and monetary tightening concerns \u2013 and the US dollar strengthened on safe haven demand while EME currencies weakened. As the Fed commenced raising rates in March along with guidance for quantitative tightening beginning May, the US dollar softened on pro\ufb01t taking, bond yields \ufb01rmed up, equities traded higher and commodity prices, especially oil, witnessed correction. Overall, global \ufb01nancial markets remained volatile in Q4 and shadowed by turbulence. outbreak, faster than anticipated pace of normalisation in advanced countries, domestic in\ufb02ation concerns, bearishness about the large government borrowing programme and, more recently, geopolitical con\ufb02ict and the sympathetic jump in crude oil prices. Amidst portfolio out\ufb02ows in Q4:2021-22, a pick-up in government spending has kept short-term liquidity conditions comfortable. During H2:2021-22, money market rates \ufb01rmed up in closer alignment with the reverse repo rate \u2013 the lower bound of the policy rate corridor \u2013 re\ufb02ecting the rebalancing of surplus liquidity from the overnight \ufb01xed rate reverse repo window towards the variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions of varying maturities (Chart IV.1). As a result, the weighted average call rate (WACR) \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 traded 2 basis points (bps) below the reverse repo rate, on average, in H2 as compared with 17 bps below in H1. The WACR sporadically \ufb01rmed up above the reverse repo rate due to transient factors such as the occurrence of public holidays towards the end of the reserve maintenance cycle in the third week of November 2021, advance tax payments in the second half of December 2021 and March 2022, and larger than anticipated collections under the goods and services tax (GST). Domestic \ufb01nancial markets remained relatively stable in H2:2021-22 amidst surplus liquidity conditions with intermittent bouts of volatility caused by Omicron\u2019s In the overnight call money segment, the weighted average rate (WAR) of traded deals was 16 bps above the reverse repo rate while that on reported rates in the reported deals, pulled down the WACR below the reverse repo rate. The greater share of the reported deals in the total volume of the call money market re\ufb02ected the increased share of lending by co- cent in H2 was the same as in H1. In the collateralised segment, the share of tri-party repo increased to corresponding decline in the market repo share to 22 per cent from 25 per cent (Chart IV.3). Mutual funds \u2013 the major lender in both the collateralised segments \u2013 deals1 was 16 bps below, re\ufb02ecting market segmentation as small cooperative banks \u2013 principal lenders in reported deals \u2013 lend at lower rates towards the close of market hours (Chart IV.2a). The average monthly volume of reported deals in H2 at `1.06 lakh crore exceeded that in the traded segment of `0.74 increased their participation from 68 per cent in H1 to share in the market repo, however, declined from 70 per cent in H1 to 56 per cent in H2. On the borrowing party repo segment increased from 52 per cent in H1 \u2018Traded deals\u2019 are negotiated directly on the NDS-Call platform whereas \u2018reported deals\u2019 are over-the-counter (OTC) deals which are reported on the Note: Based on daily data for August 13, 2021 to March 31, 2022. Source: RBI staff estimates. to 64 per cent in H2 and from 8 per cent to 16 per cent in market repo, driven by low-cost funds from mutual funds. With increasing amounts absorbed under the VRRR auctions at higher cut-offs (see section IV.3 for details), the effective reverse repo rate (ERRR)2 increased from 3.39 per cent in September 2021 to 3.78 per cent in March 2022, inching closer to the repo rate (Table IV.1). The overnight segment rates \u2013 the weighted average call rate (WACR), the tri-party repo rate and the market repo \u2013 which traded below the reverse repo rate during H1:2021-22 \u2013 gradually trended upwards. Similarly, the rates on 3-month T-bill, certi\ufb01cates of deposit (CDs) and commercial paper issuances by non-banking \ufb01nancial companies (CP-NBFCs) moved higher, with their spreads at 26 bps, 38 bps and 80 bps, respectively, above the reverse repo rate during H2 as against 1 bps, 8 bps and 28 bps during H1 (Chart IV.4). 2 The effective reverse repo rate is the weighted average of the \ufb01xed rate reverse repo rate and the VRRR auctions of varying maturities with the weights being the amounts absorbed under the respective windows. Issuances of CDs increased to `1.73 lakh crore in H2 from `0.60 lakh crore in H1, re\ufb02ecting additional fund mobilisation by banks alongside an uptick in bank credit. Commercial paper (CP) issuances remained at `10.1 lakh crore during H2, unchanged from H1, supported by ample surplus liquidity and congenial \ufb01nancing conditions (Chart IV.5.a). Short-term CP issuances were boosted by the rush of initial public offerings (IPOs) and their \ufb01nancing by non-banking \ufb01nancial companies (NBFCs) (Chart IV.5.b). Monthly CP issuances and weighted average discount rate (WADR) peaked in mid-November 2021, tracking IPO issuances. Outstanding CPs moderated to `3.52 lakh crore in March 2022 from `3.71 lakh crore in September 2021, re\ufb02ecting higher issuances of short tenors (Table IV.2). During H2:2021-22, the 10-year G-sec yield hardened by 63 basis points, re\ufb02ecting global and domestic factors (Chart IV.6). It rose by 24 bps during Q3, driven by higher international crude oil prices, domestic in\ufb02ation and increasing government bond yields in major economies including the US, which more than offset the intermittent softening owing to the lower-than-expected CPI print for India for September, tax cuts on petrol and diesel, and a sharp decline in US yields following the outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. In Q4, the benchmark yield \ufb01rmed up by a further 39 bps owing to higher-than-expected indicative calendar of market borrowings of State Governments/Union Territories, planned market borrowings by the Centre indicated in the Union Budget 2022-23 and the rise in US yields, international crude oil and other commodity prices over escalating geopolitical tensions. The cancellation of two consecutive central government bond auctions, however, tempered the hardening of domestic yields. @: Total issuances during the month. Source: CCIL, F-Trac and RBI. Omicron led sharp decline in US yields At the shorter end of the primary market segment, yields on T-bills \ufb01rmed up in sync with the increase in the effective reverse repo rate (Chart IV.7). The average level of yield increased by 38 bps during H2. The slope \ufb02attened by 41 bps in view of the sharper increase in the short-term rates on account of the liquidity rebalancing (Chart IV.9)3. Average trading volume in both G-secs and T-bills dipped in H2:2021-22, amidst rising yields and elevated uncertainty (Chart IV.8).

The weighted average maturity (WAM) of the outstanding stock of G-secs increased to 11.71 years as on March 31, 2022 from 11.57 years as at end-September 2021. The weighted average coupon (WAC) at 7.11 per cent was lower than 7.15 per cent over the same period. The weighted average spread of cut-off yields on state development loans (SDLs) over G-sec yields of comparable maturities moderated to 36 bps in H2 from 48 bps in H1 (Chart IV.10). The average inter-state spread on securities of 10-year tenor (fresh issuances) was 4 bps in H2, the same as in H1. Spread (bps) (over corresponding risk-free rate) Note: Yields and spreads are computed as monthly averages. Source: FIMMDA and Bloomberg. Tracking G-sec yields, corporate bond yields moved higher and risk premia compressed amidst moderation in new issuances. The yields on AAA-rated 3-year bonds issued by NBFCs increased by 66 bps to 5.98 per cent in H2 and those on corporates and public sector undertakings (PSUs), \ufb01nancial institutions (FIs) and banks by 64 bps and 51 bps to 5.88 per cent and 5.84 per cent, respectively (Chart IV.11a). The risk premium or spread over 3-year G-sec yields declined from 49 bps to 37 bps in H2 for NBFCs, from 50 bps to 23 bps for PSUs, FIs and banks and from 40 bps to 26 bps for corporates (Chart IV.11b). The moderation in the risk premia (spreads) was seen across tenors and rating spectrum in H2 (Table IV.3). The 3-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the State Bank of India and ICICI Bank trading overseas increased by 2 bps and 10 bps, respectively at end- March 2022 from end-September 2021. Issuances of corporate bonds in the primary market declined to `2.47 lakh crore during H2 (up to February 2022) from `3.06 lakh crore during the corresponding period of 2020-21 as corporates\u2019 resource requirements moderated with the capex cycle being still at a nascent stage (Chart IV.12a). Corporates resorted to increased overseas issuances in 2021-22, taking advantage of lower cost of funds abroad (Chart IV.12b). Competitive lending rates offered by banks also contributed to lower domestic bond issuances. Nearly the entire resource mobilisation in the corporate bond market (98.2 per cent) was through the private placement route. The outstanding investments by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) in corporate bonds declined marginally from `1.28 lakh crore at end-September 2021 to `1.21 lakh crore at end-March 2022, pulling down the utilisation of The daily average secondary market trading volume increased by 10.6 per cent to `6,730 crore during H2 (up to February 2022) over the corresponding period of Indian equity markets corrected marginally in H2:2021- 22 amidst high volatility triggered by the outbreak of policy stances of global central banks, elevated crude oil prices and escalating geopolitical tensions. Domestic equities witnessed sharp selloffs in the second half tensions but recovered in the second half of March. Overall, the BSE Sensex lost 0.9 per cent in H2 to close at 58,569 (Chart IV.13a). The correction in the stock prices, coupled with higher corporate earnings, led to the price-to-earnings ratio (of BSE Sensex) falling to 25.1 at end-March 2022 from 27.6 at end-September 2021, moderating the valuation premium over its long-term average (Chart IV.13b). high net worth individuals) in equities rose further during H2, extending the buying interest noted in H1 (Chart IV.13d). Apprehensions over the faster than anticipated pace of normalisation by the US Fed, the rise in the US treasury yields and the rush to safe haven amidst escalating tensions around Russia-Ukraine triggered a selling spree by the FPIs amounting to `1.38 lakh crore from the domestic equity market in H2. These sales, however, were more than offset by purchases by domestic institutional investors (DIIs) to the tune of `1.64 lakh crore (Chart IV.13c). Amongst (including domestic buyers, retail participation The vibrancy in the IPO segment continued during H2 (up to February 2022), with 27 issuances mobilising `0.62 lakh crore (`0.23 lakh crore in the corresponding period of the previous year) (Chart IV.14a). The amounts raised through the rights issues also increased to `0.25 lakh crore in H2 (up to February) from `0.04 lakh crore during the corresponding period of the previous year.

The INR traded with an appreciating bias between mid-October and mid-November 2021. In the following months, it depreciated amidst FPI out\ufb02ows, the strengthening US dollar, increasing market expectations of a faster than anticipated monetary policy normalisation by the US Fed and other major AEs, rise in crude oil prices and escalating geopolitical tensions, touching a low of ` 76.924 per US$ on March 7, 2022. The INR reversed some of these losses in the subsequent days with the correction in crude oil prices and was at ` 75.81 on March 31, 2022. Volatility measured by 1-month at the money (ATM) option implied volatility5 of the INR surged, surpassing levels observed during the second wave of the pandemic; it however, eased in the second half of March (Chart IV.15b). In terms of the 40-currency nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and real effective exchange rate (REER), the INR depreciated by 1.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively, between September 2021 and March 31, 2022 (Table IV.4). The nominal and real movements in the Indian rupee exchange rate against the US dollar were muted in relation to a number of other emerging market currencies. This re\ufb02ects the underlying stability of the INR even as some other emerging market peers faced sharp depreciation (Chart IV.16).

Credit offtake picked up during 2021-22, with the gradual return of normalcy after the pandemic. Non- food credit extended by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose by 9.7 per cent (y-o-y) as on March 25 (4.5 per cent a year ago) (Chart IV.18). The recovery in bank credit was led by private sector banks that provided the bulk (50..4 per cent) of the incremental y-o-y credit (up to March 25, 2022), followed by PSBs (44.7 per cent) (Chart IV.19b). Credit growth was driven by all the major economic sectors6.

Growth in credit to industry recovered to 6.5 per cent in February 2022 from a low of 1.0 per cent a year ago, aided by higher \ufb02ows to MSMEs and a turnaround in large industry. Personal loans remained the key driver of overall bank credit, with a share of 42.7 per cent in incremental offtake (y-o-y) in February 2022 (Chart IV.20a and b). The uptick in credit growth was seen across banks (Chart IV.20c)8. Within industry, credit to MSMEs bene\ufb01tted from the launch of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) in May 2020 and the subsequent expansions in its scope, which helped push up credit growth to micro and small industries to 19.9 per cent in February 2022 (3.1 per cent a year ago) and to medium industries to 71.4 per cent (30.6 per cent a year ago) (Chart IV.21a and b). The Union Budget 2022-23 has extended the ECLGS to March 2023, with the guarantee cover increasing by ` 50,000 crore to a total cover of `5 lakh crore. Credit to large industry emerged out of an extended period of contraction/ slow growth and recorded 0.5 per cent growth in February 2022, supported by key industries such as engineering; chemicals and chemical products; food processing; leather and leather products; and rubber, plastic, and their products.

In February 2022, lending rates (outstanding loans) were the lowest in respect of housing loans, re\ufb02ecting the lower risk of default and the availability of collaterals. Other personal loans, i.e., loans other than housing, vehicle and educational loans are mostly unsecured and hence they have higher credit risk and spreads (Chart IV.28). In the case of fresh loans, large industry got loans at the lowest rates, followed by infrastructure and housing loans9. The reduction in lending rates was seen across most sectors in 2021-22, adding to the softening recorded in 2020-21. The decline was the sharpest for agricultural loans, industry and other large personal loans in the case of fresh rupee loans and for infrastructure, other personal loans, vehicle and Monetary transmission to WALR on fresh rupee loans in retail and MSME sectors, where new \ufb02oating rate loans have been mandatorily linked to an external benchmark10, registered substantial improvement (Chart IV.29). ) s t n i o p s i s a b ( n o i t a i r a V e r u t l u c i r g A ) e g r a L ( e r u t c u r t s a r f n I e d a r T g n i s u o H e l c i h e V n o i t a c u d E l l a r e v O 9 The share of outstanding loans linked to external benchmarks increased from 4.7 per cent in March 2020 to 20.4 per cent in December 2021 for industry (large) and from 8.9 per cent to 20.8 per cent for infrastructure segment. 10 The Reserve Bank mandated that all scheduled commercial banks (excluding regional rural banks) should link all new \ufb02oating rate personal or retail loans and \ufb02oating rate loans to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) to an external benchmark, viz., the policy repo rate or 3-month T-bill rate or 6-month T-bill rate or any other benchmark market interest rate published by Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd.

The spreads charged by domestic banks over the policy repo rate (in the case of loans where the repo rate is the external benchmark) moderated during H2, and were the lowest for other personal loans and housing loans in February 2022 (Table IV.7).

Concomitantly, the weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on outstanding deposits declined by 143 bps. Banks with higher WADTDR have undertaken more rate cuts in the current easing cycle (Chart IV.30c). The decline in the MTDR of PvBs exceeded that of PSBs, leading to a greater alignment in the levels of deposit rates across the two bank groups. With improving credit demand, however, banks have started pricing in their deposits at higher rates to mobilise stable funding. As a result, the WADTDR on fresh deposits has increased by 24 bps since October 2021. The median saving deposit rate for domestic banks has remained sticky in the range of 2.9 to 3 per cent since June 2020.

In view of the increase in the G-sec yields in recent months, the excess of the announced interest rates on SSIs over the respective formula- based rates moderated to 9-118 bps for Q1:2022-23 from 42-168 bps in Q4:2021-22 (Table IV.8). The RBI Act, 1934 requires the Reserve Bank to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time, if any, in the public domain. As part of the monetary policy and other announcements of April 8, 2022 certain changes have been effected in the operating procedure to further re\ufb01ne it by improving its \ufb02exibility, ef\ufb01ciency in liquidity management and operational convenience, as set out below (Box IV.2). In consonance with the accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Reserve Bank maintained ample surplus liquidity in the system during H2, aimed at nurturing and supporting the nascent growth impulses by ensuring adequate \ufb02ow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy. Simultaneously, with the objective of restoring the revised liquidity management framework \u2013 suspended in March 2020 after the outbreak of COVID-19 \u2013 the RBI continued with rebalancing of liquidity from the passive \ufb01xed rate overnight reverse repo window towards longer tenors through VRRR auctions in a gradual, calibrated and non-disruptive manner. The amendment to Section 17 of the RBI Act in 2018 enables the Reserve Bank to introduce the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF). By removing the binding collateral constraint on the central bank, the SDF strengthens the operating framework of monetary policy. The SDF as the \ufb02oor of the LAF corridor would provide symmetry to the operating framework of monetary policy by introducing a standing absorption facility at the bottom of the LAF corridor, similar to the standing injection tool at the upper end of the corridor, namely the marginal standing facility (MSF). Thus, at both ends of the LAF corridor, there will be standing facilities \u2013 one to absorb and the other to inject liquidity. Accordingly, access to SDF and MSF will be at the discretion of banks, unlike repo/reverse repo, OMO and CRR which are available at the discretion of the Reserve Bank. The SDF is also a \ufb01nancial stability tool in addition to its role in liquidity management. The SDF rate will be 25 bps below the policy rate, and it will be applicable to overnight deposits at this stage. It would, however, retain the \ufb02exibility to absorb liquidity of longer tenors as and when the need arises, with appropriate pricing. The MSF rate will continue to be 25 bps above the policy repo rate. Thus, the width of the LAF corridor is restored to the pre-pandemic con\ufb01guration of 50 bps, symmetrically around the policy repo rate, which will be at the centre of the corridor. The \ufb01xed rate reverse repo (FRRR) rate is retained at 3.35 per cent. It will remain as part of RBI\u2019s toolkit and its operation will be at the discretion of the RBI for purposes speci\ufb01ed from time to time. The FRRR along with the SDF will impart \ufb02exibility to the RBI\u2019s liquidity management framework. Both MSF and SDF will be available on all days of the week, throughout the year. Currency demand was the prime source of liquidity leakage while drawdown of government cash balances emerged as the main driver of liquidity accretion during H2. Currency in circulation (CiC) increased by `2.1 lakh crore during H2 (up to March 25, 2022), driven by festival season demand and rabi crop harvesting. RBI\u2019s forex operations also sucked out liquidity to the tune of `1.0 lakh crore in H2 on account of FPI out\ufb02ows, contrary to a substantial injection of `3.0 lakh crore during H111. The drainage of liquidity due to these factors was to an extent offset by accretion on 11 The two-year USD-INR sell/buy swap of US$ 5 billion conducted on March 8, 2022 with a view to elongating the maturity pro\ufb01le of the forward book (deferring liquidity injection through forward delivery to the far leg) mopped up liquidity amounting to `0.39 lakh crore. operations (OMOs) drained liquidity in H2 in contrast to a sizeable injection in H1 from the secondary market G-Sec Acquisition Programme (G-SAP) (Box IV.3). G-SAP was discontinued in H2, given the Asset purchase programs (APPs) have been undertaken by several central banks (including EMEs) following the COVID-19 outbreak to ease monetary and \ufb01nancial conditions in support of economic recovery (IMF, 2020). APPs lower yields through two main channels, viz., (i) the supply channel by which an APP announcement can immediately moderate the risk premium in anticipation of reduced net supply of government bonds in the market; and (ii) the signalling channel as market participants may perceive the recourse to an APP as an indication that the economic outlook is weak necessitating lower policy rates for a longer period (Arora et al., 2021). In the Indian context, the Reserve Bank purchased G-secs of `2.2 lakh crore under G-SAP in H1:2021- 22 to anchor yield expectations in the context of the large borrowing programme of the Government. Asset purchases under G-SAP were different from regular open market operation (OMO) purchases as (i) these provided an upfront commitment on amounts in contrast to regular OMOs, which are discretionary; (ii) the size of G-SAP auctions was larger than conventional OMOs; and (iii) purchases included both liquid and illiquid securities (RBI, 2021). The market response to the nine G-SAP auctions was favourable (Chart IV.3.1). The last two auctions were liquidity neutral with purchases being offset by simultaneous sales of an identical amount (special OMOs). To assess the announcement effect of the G-SAP on yields in an event study (ES) framework, daily changes (closet - closet-1) in the benchmark 10-year G-sec yield (Gsec) for April-September 2021 (period during which G-SAP was conducted) are regressed on the proximate macroeconomic and \ufb01nancial market drivers of yields: (i) change in yield on the previous day to account for hysteresis effects (persistence); (ii) changes in US 10- year bond yield (US10Y) and crude oil prices (Crude) to capture the impact of global factors on domestic yields; and (iii) domestic in\ufb02ation surprises ((cid:507) In\ufb02ation) which is de\ufb01ned as the difference between actual CPI in\ufb02ation and consensus forecasts. The impact of G-SAP on yields is captured by inclusion of a dummy for the policy day (April 4) when G-SAP was announced (GSAP_GS) and for each of the respective G-SAP announcement (GSAP_IA) dates12. The estimated coef\ufb01cients suggest a statistically signi\ufb01cant impact of domestic and global factors (domestic in\ufb02ation, US bond yields and crude oil prices) on yields (Table IV.3.1). The G-SAP announcements cumulatively 12 Idiosyncratic events/factors which impacted yields during this period \u2013 conversion/switch operation conducted on April 15 (D_Switch) and the introduction of a new 10-year benchmark announced on July 5 (D_NB) \u2013 are also controlled for in the regression.

Liquidity absorption the reverse repo mirrored movements in government cash balances, given the latter\u2019s transient role in driving frictional liquidity (Chart IV.32). The Reserve Bank progressively enhanced the size of the 14-day VRRR auctions in H2 to re-establish softened the benchmark bond yield by 9 basis points in spite of gross market borrowings remaining elevated for the second successive year and recurrent supply shocks that kept in\ufb02ation elevated. Thus, G-SAP operations facilitated congenial and orderly \ufb01nancing conditions that provided a conducive environment for the domestic recovery. them as the main liquidity management operation, complemented by \ufb01ne tuning operations of varying sizes and maturities (3-28 days). The 14-day VRRR auction amount was increased in a calibrated and pre- announced path from `4.0 lakh crore on October 8 to `7.5 lakh crore by December 31, 2021. Due to their higher remuneration relative to the \ufb01xed rate reverse repos, the VRRR auctions drew favourable market responses. Re\ufb02ecting these developments, the amount absorbed under the \ufb01xed rate reverse repo declined to a daily average of `2.0 lakh crore in H2 from `4.7 lakh crore in H1, with a concomitant increase in absorption through variable rates (both main and \ufb01ne- tuning operations) to `6.2 lakh crore from `2.3 lakh crore over the same period (Chart IV.33). The Reserve Bank\u2019s commitment to \ufb02exibly conduct \ufb01ne tuning operations was reinforced through three variable rate repo (VRR) auctions of 1-3-day maturity, cumulatively injecting `2.0 lakh crore during January 20-24, 2022 to address transient liquidity tightness on account of higher than anticipated collections under the GST. As a step towards rebalancing the liquidity surplus, it was decided to provide one more option to banks to prepay the outstanding amount of funds availed under the targeted long term repo operations (TLTRO 1.0 and 2.0) conducted during March-April 2020. Accordingly, banks cumulatively returned `39,882 crore in two tranches \u2013 `2,434 crore in December 2021 over and above `37,348 crore paid earlier in November 2020. Moreover, given the limited recourse by banks to the marginal standing facility (MSF) in the post-pandemic period due to surplus liquidity conditions, the normal dispensation of allowing banks to dip up to 2 per cent (instead of 3 per cent) of their NDTL was reinstated effective January 1, 2022. At the same time, the RBI extended the deadlines of key targeted liquidity facilities, given the needs of the stressed sectors: special long-term repo operations (SLTRO) facility for small \ufb01nance banks (SFBs) were made available till December 31, 2021, while also making it on tap; the liquidity facilities of `50,000 crore to ease access to emergency health services and `15,000 crore for contact-intensive sectors were extended up to June 30, 2022 from March 31, 2022. With the progressive return of normalcy, and in order to restore the revised liquidity management framework, the RBI announced on February 10, 2022 that (i) the variable rate repo (VRR) operations of varying tenors would be conducted as and when warranted by the evolving liquidity and \ufb01nancial conditions within the CRR maintenance cycle; (ii) VRRs and VRRRs of 14-day tenor will operate as the main liquidity management tool based on liquidity conditions, conducted to coincide with the CRR maintenance cycle; (iii) the main operations will be supported by \ufb01ne-tuning operations to tide over any unanticipated liquidity changes during the reserve maintenance period while auctions of longer maturity will also be conducted, if required; and (iv) effective March 1, 2022, the windows for \ufb01xed rate reverse repo and the MSF operations would be available during 17.30-23.59 hours on all days (as against 09.00-23.59 hours since March 30, 2020 as an interim measure to provide market participants greater \ufb02exibility in their liquidity management in view of COVID-19). Market participants were advised to shift their balances out of the \ufb01xed rate reverse repo into VRRR auctions and avail the automated sweep-in and sweep-out (ASISO) facility in the e-Kuber portal for operational convenience13. Domestic \ufb01nancial markets have moved broadly in sync with the accommodative monetary policy stance. The rebalancing of liquidity from the \ufb01xed rate window to variable rate reverse repo auctions is \ufb01rming up money market rates. Bond yields have risen from historic lows on the back of higher crude oil prices and the expected monetary policy normalisation by advanced economy central banks. Nevertheless, \ufb01nancial conditions remain conducive 13 ASISO is an optional facility introduced in August 2020 to provide greater \ufb02exibility to banks in managing their day-end CRR balances under which banks pre-set a speci\ufb01c (or range) amount that they wish to maintain at the end of the day. Any shortfall or excess balances maintained will automatically trigger MSF or reverse repo bids, as the case may be, under the ASISO facility. to growth and credit offtake is gaining traction. The RBI\u2019s market operations remain supportive of the recovery. Going forward, they will contextually factor in the developments in global \ufb01nancial and commodity markets, which are witnessing volatility due to worsening geopolitical situations and monetary policy normalisation in the major AEs, so as to insulate domestic \ufb01nancial markets from spillovers. The global economy has been buffeted by severe shocks since the October 2021 MPR. The sharp increase in geopolitical tensions since January 2022 escalating into a full-fledged war in February is imposing a threat to the world economy and its financial system architecture. Meanwhile, inflation is at multi-decadal highs and increasingly getting persistent across major advanced economies and several emerging market economies. The global economy has been buffeted by severe shocks since the October 2021 MPR. In November, the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the virus emerged, but its impact on lives and livelihoods turned out to be benign relative to earlier waves and, on the global economy, transient. Furthermore, supply chain disruptions intensi\ufb01ed, posing a risk to the global recovery. More recently, the sharp increase in geopolitical tensions since January 2022 escalating into a full-\ufb02edged war in February is imposing a bigger threat to the world economy and its \ufb01nancial system architecture. Meanwhile, in\ufb02ation is at multi-decadal highs and increasingly getting persistent across major advanced economies (AEs) and several emerging market economies (EMEs). The tectonic upward shift in commodity prices, including food and energy, due to the war is making the macroeconomic picture murkier (Box V.1). Geopolitical hostilities in Ukraine are casting a strong downside to the global macroeconomy. The immediate direct hit on commodities and \ufb01nancial markets has aggravated, with \ufb01nancial sanctions and retaliation. The closure of shipping routes and air space, suspension of logistic and shipping services and shutting down of pipelines, on account of sanctions/apprehensions/ voluntary private decisions are creating a new wave of supply disruptions. This is likely to further add to freight costs, ultimately feeding into in\ufb02ation and impacting trade and output. A surge in geopolitical risk is associated with signi\ufb01cant economic contraction, particularly in emerging market economies (Cheng and Chiu, 2018). edible oil, wheat, minerals and metals produced by these two countries (Chart V.1.2). Global food in\ufb02ation and food security are hostage to the war, as are energy-dependent nations and fertiliser importers, including India. There are second-order spillovers too \u2013 it is estimated that the global light vehicle production would be reduced by 2.6 million units in 2022 and 2023 as the con\ufb02ict has disrupted supplies of vehicle components, including electric power communication parts, palladium, aluminium, nickel and semiconductor- grade neon. Russia and Ukraine were the 11th and 55th largest economies in the world in 2020, accounting for about 1.7 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively, of the world\u2019s nominal GDP. Their shares in world exports at 2.3 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively, notwithstanding, they have a dominant in\ufb02uence on supplies of key commodities, resulting in an outsized impact on in\ufb02ation, trade and output at the global level (Chart V.1.1). The world runs a high exposure to fuel, gas, some agro, wood products, If commodity and \ufb01nancial market shocks persist for at least one year, it is estimated that in 2022, global GDP growth could be reduced by more than 1 percentage point and the global consumer price in\ufb02ation could be raised by around 2.5 percentage points (OECD, 2022). Europe is likely to be the most impacted in view of high dependence on energy imports. Moreover, it is seeing a massive refugee in\ufb02ux. The OECD estimates that the cost of accommodating 3 million refugees \u2013 the total in\ufb02ow in the \ufb01rst three weeks of the war \u2013 in 2022 would be around 0.25 per cent of the European Union\u2019s GDP.

(2018): \u201cHow Important are Global Geopolitical Risks to Emerging Countries?\u201d International Economics, doi:10.1016/j.inteco.2018.05.002 While there was a pick-up in the momentum of global growth in Q4:2021, more recent high frequency indicators point to some loss of pace in Q1:2022. The US economy registered impressive gains in Q4:2021 primarily due to strong consumer/business investment spending and non-residential \ufb01xed (Table V.1). Furthermore, private inventory investment and exports also contributed positively. As a result, US GDP grew by 5.7 per cent in 2021 \u2013 the highest since 1984 \u2013 as against a contraction of 3.4 per cent in 2020. As 2022 began, the rapid spread of the Omicron variant appeared to be causing a slowdown in some sectors of the economy but the virus spread has been receding since mid-January. The S&P Global US composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) after touching an 18-month low of 51.1 in January bounced back to 55.9 in February 2022 as virus containment measures were scaled back and further rose to an 8-month high in March with broad-based acceleration in activity. The US labour market continued to tighten, with wages rising 4.5 per cent in 2021 \u2013 the fastest pace since 1983 \u2013 although the labour force participation rate remained below pre-pandemic levels. Stronger household balance sheets, rising employment and adaptation to the pandemic by businesses are factors supporting the outlook whereas the war and the pandemic are the major headwinds. The Euro area\u2019s GDP grew by 1.0 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q4:2021, its slowest rate in three quarters, as the Omicron variant\u2019s spread necessitated restrictions, creating labour shortages and denting consumer con\ufb01dence. The composite PMI for the Euro zone registered its highest monthly jump in \ufb01ve months in February 2022 as containment measures abated but slid in March as business activity slowed down particularly in manufacturing. The growth outlook for 2022 is overcast by the war and persistently high and rising energy costs. Quarter-on-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualised rate (Q-o-q, SAAR) E: Estimate P: Projection.

In the UK, GDP grew 5.2 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q4:2021 but still remained 0.1 per cent below its pre- pandemic level, i.e., Q4:2019. As the economic impact of the Omicron variant ebbed, GDP increased to 0.8 per cent above its pre-pandemic level in January 2022, driven by growth in all sectors, including consumer- facing services, production and construction. The unemployment rate continued to decline despite closure of the furlough scheme at end-September 2021. The composite PMI hit an 8-month high of 59.9 in February 2022 driven by strong recovery in consumer spending on travel, leisure and entertainment and rose further in March. The growth outlook is, however, mired in uncertainty as the soaring of energy prices due to the war portends adversely for already high in\ufb02ation. but it remains below its pre-pandemic level of output. There was a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the beginning of 2022. The au Jibun Bank Japan composite PMI improved to 50.3 in March 2022 from 45.8 in February \u2013 \ufb01rst rise in output after three consecutive months of contraction with services continuing to be in decline. Japan\u2019s economy would likely recuperate as containment measures fade but the war may pose a downside. Japan\u2019s GDP grew by 4.6 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q4:2021, in contrast to the 2.8 per cent contraction logged in Q3. The upturn marked the strongest pace of quarterly growth in a year, as both household consumption and business investment revived amidst a decline in COVID-19 cases, easing restrictions and the advancing vaccination campaign. Overall, the Japanese economy expanded by 1.8 per cent in 2021 Moving to EMEs, the Chinese economy grew by 8.1 per cent in 2021, exceeding the government\u2019s target of above 6 per cent; however, growth of 4.0 per cent (y-o-y) in Q4:2021 was the slowest pace of expansion since Q2:2020 (Table V.2).

In March, China registered its highest daily infection tally, with several regions including Shanghai going into lockdown. The Caixin China general manufacturing PMI was 48.1 in March, lowest since February 2020 amid the new wave of COVID-19 \ufb02are-ups. Looking ahead, several weaknesses lurk in the economy, ranging from rising production and raw material costs to a doubtful demand recovery and the war. The government has set a growth target of 5.5 per cent for 2022, the lowest since 1991. Brazil\u2019s GDP growth decelerated for the second consecutive quarter to 1.6 per cent (y-o-y) in Q4:2021, with industry and agriculture registering a decline. Labour market indicators showed consistent job recovery. Exports have bene\ufb01ted from robust global demand for commodities. Supply bottlenecks, higher interest rates and policy uncertainty have, however, slowed the pace of recovery. The manufacturing PMI hit a 6-month high in March but overall remained in contraction in Q1:2022. Going forward, elevated interest rates and a fragile \ufb01scal position weigh on activity, with the ongoing war-related uncertainty remaining a key risk to the outlook. South Africa\u2019s GDP growth decelerated to 1.7 per cent (y-o-y) in Q4:2021. In January 2022, South Africa experienced its heaviest rainfall on record, which caused extensive crop damage and was declared a national disaster by the authorities. The composite PMI for March, however, signalled expansion for the third successive month due to increase in employment even as in\ufb02ation weighed on activity. Looking ahead, the growth outlook is fraught with risks, including the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, low vaccination levels, poor jobs outlook and continued disruptions to power supply. The Russian economy ended 2021 on a strong footing on sturdier industrial production growth, which more than offset a slowdown in the services sector amidst cooling retail sales. GDP expanded 4.7 per cent in 2021, recording the strongest upturn since 2008. In February 2022, the composite PMI was at a 7-month high of 50.8 but slid in March 2022 to its lowest level since May 2020, registering a marked contraction international in business activity. Furthermore, sanctions are expected to lead to a sharp downward plunge in the economy. South-east Asian economies recovered in Q4:2021 as pandemic-induced restrictions eased and inoculation rates improved. The manufacturing PMI for the ASEAN economies in March 2022 eased to a 6-month low amidst softer demand conditions. The region faces headwinds due to the war and its fallout on commodity prices, especially wheat and potassic fertiliser. (CLIs) The OECD composite available up to February 2022 suggest moderate deceleration across most major AEs and divergent movements for major EMEs (Chart V.1a). The global composite PMI suggests easing of momentum at end of Q1:2022 with the March reading moderating to 52.7 as output growth slowed in both services and manufacturing (Chart V.1b). leading World trade momentum has moderated since H2:2021 as pent-up demand normalised (Chart V.2a). This is corroborated by the World Trade Organization (WTO)\u2019s Goods Trade Barometer reading of 98.7 in December 2021, which is below the barometer\u2019s baseline value of 100. The WTO, in an October 2021 release, expected merchandise trade growth to moderate to 4.7 per cent in 2022 from 10.8 per cent in 2021. The Baltic Dry Index \u2013 a measure of shipping costs for a wide variety of bulk commodities such as coal, iron ore and grain \u2013 has moderated after peaking in October 2021. Rising uncertainty and disruptions due to the war, however, have put pressure on shipping costs (Chart V.2b). Following a blip in November 2021 on account of the Omicron\u2019s onset, global commodity prices resumed rallying in December with the outbreak of the war sending fresh shock waves across markets from end- February. As a result, prices of most commodities soared, pushing the Bloomberg commodity price index to an 8-year high in early-March. Notwithstanding some moderation thereafter, the index increased by 23.5 per cent between September 2021 and March 2022. The food price index of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) increased by 8.9 per cent between September 2021 and February 2022 (Chart V.3a). Prices hit an all-time high in February, rising 20.7 per cent (y-o-y) primarily on strong vegetable oil and dairy prices \u2013 the former reaching a new record on concerns over global supply \ufb02ows. For sugar, however, favourable production prospects in major exporting countries have kept price pressures muted since December. Food prices are likely to pick up further in coming months as fertiliser prices have soared in March on fears of prolonged disruption in global supply of potash and nitrogen crop nutrients. Crude oil prices ended 2021 51.4 per cent higher year- on-year, on the back of a rally in October and early November. They resurged in early 2022, breaching US$90 per barrel towards end-January \u2013 the \ufb01rst time in seven years \u2013 as demand remained robust while supply faced capacity constraints and escalated geopolitical tensions (Chart V.3b). With the Russia- Ukraine war propelling risks of outright supply losses and OPEC plus providing no respite, crude oil prices rocketed to a 14-year high of US$133 per barrel in the \ufb01rst week of March. Prices have remained volatile thereafter \ufb02uctuating around US$110 per barrel. Notwithstanding the volatility, brent crude oil prices surged by 38 per cent in Q1:2022. Base metal prices, measured by Bloomberg\u2019s base metal spot index, increased by 25.0 per cent between September 2021 and March 2022 (Chart V.4). From end-December there has been a broad-based pick up in metal prices, underpinned by improved demand prospects as also strained supplies due to disruptions in a few major metal exporting countries. The war upended the markets and most metals scaled multi- year highs, with aluminium and nickel leading. Following the unprecedented surge in prices, the London Metal Exchange suspended nickel trading for over a week in the second week of March. Gold prices inched up and stayed around the psychological level of US$1,800 per troy ounce in Q4:2021 and January 2022. Bullion prices spurted from February on increased \ufb02ight to safety before paring some gains in the second half of March. In\ufb02ation ratcheted up across economies on cost push pressures from persistent supply chain bottlenecks, high commodity prices and spiralling wage pressures. Headline in\ufb02ation has soared to multi-decadal highs across most AEs, barring Japan; for EMEs too, barring China and Indonesia, it continued to hover at elevated levels (Table V.3). High energy and food costs are the major drivers for in\ufb02ation in AEs besides, price pressures in durable goods, particularly used cars and trucks, and services such as rents. For most EMEs, however, in\ufb02ation is essentially driven by supply shocks with demand- pull pressures remaining relatively weak, given the slack in economic activity. In the US, headline in\ufb02ation in terms of both the CPI and the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index \u2013 the Federal Reserve (Fed)\u2019s preferred measure of in\ufb02ation \u2013 edged up to fresh 40-year high of 7.9 per cent and 6.4 per cent, respectively, in February 2022 (Chart V.5a). The monthly momentum of in\ufb02ation quickened from October 2021 primarily on surging energy, food and durable goods prices. Moreover, spiralling rents and building wage pressures mirrored in the multi-decadal high annual wage growth are Notes: (1) Quarterly in\ufb02ation is the simple average of in\ufb02ation in each month of the quarter.

In\ufb02ationary pressures are high for food and durable In the Euro area, CPI in\ufb02ation has been treading above goods as well, while broadening to the services sector the European Central Bank (ECB)\u2019s target of 2 per cent since July 2021, with the headline reading scaling partly due to change in value added tax (VAT) rates for In\ufb02ation remained relatively benign in Japan though de\ufb02ation ended in September 2021.

In Brazil, increase in prices 1 As per the historical modelled series, the February 2022 print is the highest since the March 1992 reading of 7.1 per cent. have become more widespread in recent months. Apart from elevated costs for industrial goods, acceleration in services in\ufb02ation has also added to the upside. CPI in\ufb02ation in Russia rose to 9.2 per cent in February 2022 with cost-push pressures stemming from commodity prices, labour shortages and capacity shortfalls spiralling amidst a steady demand recovery. In South Africa, CPI in\ufb02ation has edged up but remains within the central bank\u2019s target range. In January, however, in\ufb02ation eased to 5.7 per cent following some softening in the cost of fuel and health services and remained steady in February. In China, unlike in other BRICS economies, CPI in\ufb02ation remained subdued re\ufb02ecting broad moderation in both food, especially pork, and non-food prices. Even core in\ufb02ation has remained muted due to weakening demand for services amidst sporadic COVID-19 \ufb02are-ups and associated stringent restrictions. Producer price in\ufb02ation has been easing since November after hitting a 26-year high in October, as price stabilisation measures cooled off the rally in raw material prices. response to the pandemic is estimated at US$19.0 US$16.1 trillion was by AE central banks and US$2.9 In the US, the Fed began tapering monthly asset Recent research2 suggests that global in\ufb02ation in 2022 could be 1.5 percentage points higher because of the increase in shipping costs in 2021. This is because the impact of rise in shipping costs peaks in 12 months and lasts up to 18 months. The increased supply disruptions due to the war and China lockdowns could further exacerbate the in\ufb02ation upside. January meeting, the Fed issued a set of principles for reducing the size of its balance sheet: (i) target range for the federal funds rate would be the primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy; (ii) reduction in balance sheet size would commence COVID-19 saw an unprecedented policy response mounted by governments and central banks. The IMF estimates that up to September 2021, US$16.9 trillion or 16.4 per cent of global GDP had been pledged as \ufb01scal support in response to the pandemic, with US$14.5 trillion by AEs and US$2.4 trillion by EMEs, including low-income developing countries (Table V.4). The total monetary support offered in would go down by adjusting the amount of re- investment of maturing securities; (iv) to eventually hold quantum of securities as needed to implement ample reserves regime; and (v) to eventually hold primarily Treasury securities. In its March 2022 meeting, Fed raised the target range for the Federal 2 Carri\u00e8re-Swallow, Y., Deb, P., Furceri, D., Jim\u00e9nez, D., & Ostry, J. D. (2022). \u201cShipping Costs and In\ufb02ation\u201d, IMF WP/22/61, March rate hike since December 2018. To operationalise the rate hike, the Fed revised up the interest rates on reserve balance and overnight reverse repurchase agreement by 25 bps each to 0.4 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively. According to the Summary of Economic Projections released in March 2022, the majority of FOMC participants expect interest rate to be 1.75-2.0 per cent by end-2022, i.e., a further 150 bps hike this year. In its October meeting, the ECB announced a slower pace of asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) in Q4:2021 than in the previous two quarters. In December, it further reduced the pace of purchases for Q1:2022 and announced discontinuation of PEPP at end- March 2022 but extended the reinvestment horizon by one year at least until end-2024. To smoothen the transition from end of PEPP purchases, the ECB announced doubling of monthly purchase under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) to 40 billion (approximately US$45.3 billion)3 in Q2:2022, to gradually revert to 20 billion (approximately US$22.7 billion) by October 2022. In its March meeting, the ECB lowered the monthly purchases under APP from 40 billion (approximately US$43.9 billion) in each month of the quarter to a reduced schedule of 40 billion in April, 30 billion (approximately US$33 billion) in May and 20 billion (approximately US$22 billion) in June and announced end of APP purchases in Q3:2022. The Bank of England (BoE) maintained a pause on its policy rate in its November meeting. In December 2021, it raised the Bank Rate by 15 bps and in February by another 25 bps. Also, in keeping with the guidance of its August 2021 MPR4, the BoE announced that it would stop re-investing for its maturing stock of government bonds. It would begin selling from its portfolio of government bonds only after the Bank Rate reaches 1 per cent, conditional on economic circumstances at that time. The BoE also announced that it would stop re-investing for maturing corporate bonds and that it would initiate a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed not earlier than end-2023. In March 2022, the BoE raised the Bank Rate by a further 25 bps to 0.75 per cent, suggesting that further modest tightening would be appropriate in the coming months. In its December meeting, BoJ extended the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus by six months until end- September 2022. It also signalled the completion of additional purchases of commercial paper and corporate bonds by end-March 2022 and reversion to the pre-pandemic quantum of purchases from April 2022. In its March meeting, the BoJ said that in\ufb02ation is likely to remain in positive territory for some time but maintained an overall dovish stance. Among other AE central banks, the Reserve Bank of Australia discontinued its yield curve control policy in November 2021 and halted weekly bond purchases in early February 2022. The Bank of Canada ended its weekly bond-buying programme in October 2021 and raised rate by 25 bps in March 2022 to 0.5 per cent. The Bank of Korea raised rates in November 2021 and January 2022 by 25 bps each to 1.25 per cent, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has cumulatively increased its policy rate by 75 bps since October 2021, taking it up to 1.0 per cent in February 2022 (Chart V.6a). 3 The US$ approximations for all amounts mentioned in another currency in this Chapter are based on the exchange rate (Bloomberg) on the date of announcement of the measure. 4 To begin unwinding asset purchases only after the Bank Rate reached 0.5 per cent. On the other hand, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) effected a 50 bps cut in the reserve requirement ratio from December 15, 2021, which injected 1.2 trillion yuan (approximately $188.3 billion) liquidity into the economy. The PBoC also initiated a monetary policy easing cycle by reducing the 1-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) by 5 bps in December, followed by a 10 bps cut in January 2022, supported by a 5 bps reduction in the 5-year LPR and 10 bps reductions in the interest rate on 1-year medium-term lending facility loans and 7-day reverse repurchase agreements. Since then, the PBoC has maintained a pause. In contrast, most other EME central banks continued with policy tightening in Q4:2021 and into Q1:2022. The Banco Central do Brazil (BCB) effected three consecutive 150 bps hike in October 2021, December 2021 and February 2022 and a 100 bps hike in March, thereby, raising the Selic rate to 11.75 per cent. The South African Reserve Bank raised its policy rate by 25 bps in November 2021 \u2013 \ufb01rst hike in three years \u2013 and followed it up with two more 25 bps hikes in January and March 2022, taking the policy rate to 4.25 per cent (Chart V.6b). The Bank of Russia (BoR) had raised its key rate by 275 bps in three steps between October 2021 and early February 2022 on heightening in\ufb02ation concerns. On February 28, 2022, in an emergency move, the BoR increased its key rate by 10.5 percentage points to 20 per cent to compensate for a sharp rouble depreciation and in\ufb02ation risks amidst the geopolitical upheaval. It also undertook unbound \ufb01ne-tuning operations to meet all liquidity needs of the banking system, besides other measures to shore up liquidity and the \ufb01nancial markets. As the structural liquidity de\ufb01cit in the banking system continued to build, the BoR reduced the reserve requirement for banks to 2 per cent, releasing 2.7 trillion rouble (approximately US$26 billion) liquidity. The sanctions have precluded BoR\u2019s access to its currency reserves in dollar and euros. Moreover, exclusion of major Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) would affect \ufb01nancial transactions with the rest of the world. The BoR maintained a pause on policy rate in its March meeting but announced purchase of government bonds to limit \ufb01nancial stability risks. Banco de M\u00e9xico hiked its policy rate in two steps for a total of 75 bps in Q4:2021 and by another 100 bps in Q1:2022 through 50 bps hikes each in February and March, taking the benchmark rate to 6.5 per cent. The central banks of Chile, Peru and Hungary continued their monetary tightening. The central bank of Turkey, on the other hand, followed up the 100 bps reduction in key rate in September with cuts of 200 bps in October and 100 bps each in November and December. It has, however, maintained a pause in 2022 so far, with its benchmark interest rate at 14 per cent. To normalise excess liquidity conditions, Bank Indonesia began a 300 bps increase in domestic currency reserve requirement for commercial banks in three steps from March to September 2022. Global \ufb01nancial markets remained largely buoyant, although the Omicron variant and policy pivots towards quicker normalisation caused sharp shifts in Q4:2021. Geopolitical tensions, however, took centre stage in Q1:2022, plunging them into a tailspin. Equity markets in most AEs and a few EMEs, shed the resilience of Q4 and went into a downswing for most part of Q1 before recouping some ground from mid-March (Chart V.7a). Bond yields had hardened across maturities, although slid brie\ufb02y towards end- February as investors dashed to safe haven. The US dollar strengthened on hawkish Fed statements and safe haven demand, while EME currencies broadly weakened until mid-March. Among AEs, US equities rallied in October and early November, driven by upbeat corporate earnings data for Q3:2021 before giving up some gains towards end-November as Omicron and escalating headline in\ufb02ation unnerved investors. The correction, however, proved short-lived, with the US S&P index paring losses in December as fears over the severity and economic impact of the new variant dissipated. It registered net gains in Q4 while ending 2021 almost 27 per cent per cent higher \u2013 the third successive year of double digit gains. Escalating Russia-Ukraine tensions alongside Fed\u2019s hawkish pivot triggered sharp sell-offs in January, which intensi\ufb01ed in late February and then rallied from mid-March to end of the quarter. European stock markets remained broadly supported in Q4:2021 by strong quarterly earnings and the ECB\u2019s highly accommodative stance. In Q1:2022, however, markets turned extremely volatile, reversing all early gains on in\ufb02ationary risks from soaring energy prices and heightened geopolitical tensions. From second week of March, European indices recovered partially on con\ufb02ict resolution optimism. The Nikkei continued to lag other major AE stock indices, largely due to a relatively slower recovery in the Japanese economy. It ended Q4 in negative territory and plunged to a 15-month low in end- January as market priced in faster rate hikes by the US Fed. The downtrend steepened further, with Nikkei dipping to a 16-month low in early March following outbreak of the war, but positive developments lifted sentiments thereafter. The UK stock indices, on the other hand, have strengthened since Q4, albeit with intermittent corrections. Since mid-February, however, markets trimmed gains, tracking global cues, to close the month in the red. This was followed by a sharp plunge in the \ufb01rst week of March amid turbulent geopolitical conditions. In line with other AEs, stock markets in the UK picked up from the second week of March. EME stock markets underperformed developed markets, with the MSCI EME stock index posting negative returns in Q4:2021 as also for the full year. Country-speci\ufb01c factors weighed heavily on market sentiments along with the threats to the recovery from Omicron. Weakness intensi\ufb01ed in Q1:2022 as s e i m o n o c E d e c n a v d A s e i m o n o c E t e k r a M g n i g r e m E most EME equity indices, barring a few commodity exporters, traded in the red on concerns over early policy tightening, mounting in\ufb02ationary risks and worsening geopolitical conditions (Chart V.7b). Russian stocks plummeted by more than 30 per cent after the outbreak of war, following which trading was halted for almost a month before resuming gradually from March 24. For most other EME markets, optimism on intermittent peace talks revived con\ufb01dence from mid- March, resulting in modest rise. In treasury markets, bond yields across major AEs broadly rose in Q4:2021, as investors tussled with protracted in\ufb02ation risks and withdrawal of monetary accommodation by major central banks (Chart V.8a). The increase was particularly sharp at the front end of the curve. As a result, the yield curve (10-year over 2-year) which was steepening till September, \ufb02attened since Q4. The signi\ufb01cant hardening in bond yields since mid-December, however, reversed brie\ufb02y in end-February and early March on \ufb02ight to safety. Bond yields shifted higher thereafter in response to hawkish signals from the US Fed. The US 10-year bond yield raced up above 2.0 per cent in early February before retreating on safe haven demand. With the tightening cycle commencing, the 10-year bond yield moved up from mid-March, hitting a 3-year high of 2.5 per cent in the last week of the month. Tracking global cues, Japanese bond yields jumped to their highest level in six years in February, while German 10-year bond yield moved decisively into positive territory for the \ufb01rst time since May 2019 before dipping back into negative zone in early March amidst heightened tensions. From the second week of March, however, bond yields across AEs started increasing again, as the ECB pivoted towards normalisation, while the UK effected its third consecutive hike. Bond yields in major EMEs remained highly volatile and traded with a hardening bias as \ufb01nancial conditions tightened (Chart V.8b). 10-year bond yields in major EMEs show strong co-movement with the US 10-year treasury yield, though the strength of the co- movement varies across countries (Box V.2). Chinese bond yields, however, have generally softened on rising monetary accommodation. Bond yields have hardened for most EMEs from mid-February, with a notable spike in Russia, followed by some softening in second half of March. The US long-term yields impact other countries through various channels, with consequent portfolio rebalancing and capital out\ufb02ows putting pressure on emerging market exchange rates and bond prices (Chart V.2.1). Correlation of movements in 10-year government bond yields of the US and eight EMEs5 viz., Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Indonesia, Mexico and Philippines and one AE6, i.e., Hong Kong is positive and signi\ufb01cant (Table V.2.1). The forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) based on a vector autoregression (VAR)7 examines sensitivity of long-term bond yields in EMEs to changes in US bond yields (Belke et. al, 2017). Measures of spillover intensities from the US to other countries and vice versa are estimated by using a spillover 5 Covering BRICS and all constituents of the \u201cfragile \ufb01ve\u201d of 2013, barring Turkey for which data was not available for the full sample. 6 Due to its currency\u2019s peg to the dollar and being a regional \ufb01nancial hub, Hong Kong is a conduit of transmission of US yields to a broad set of EMEs in the ASEAN region. 7 VAR framework has been used as it allows all variables to be considered endogenous \u2013 considering the possibility of spillback effects among EMEs as well as to the US primarily through trade, \ufb01nancial, and commodity price channels.

In the currency markets, the US dollar rallied strongly in Q4:2021 on Fed policy pivot (Chart V.9a). In Q1, after a brief spell of correction in early January, the US dollar recovered strongly but hit a patch of volatility. From the latter half of February, however, it rose steadily on safe haven demand due to the ongoing geopolitical upheaval, in addition to the anticipated US policy rate lift-off in March. It remained elevated in March with \ufb02uctuations in market sentiments imparting volatility. EME currencies moved in reverse tandem and broadly depreciated, barring a few commodity exporters. The index, however, moved up from mid-March. The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index increased by 0.7 per cent in Q4:2021 and changed negligibly in Q1:2022. There has been retrenchment in capital \ufb02ows since Q4:2021 culminating into net out\ufb02ows in March (Chart V.9b). b: Portfolio Flows to EMEs Monetary authorities have begun exiting from the extraordinary accommodation prompted by the once- in-a-century COVID-19 crisis. The Russia-Ukraine war and its rami\ufb01cations for global growth, in\ufb02ation and \ufb01nancial conditions have overwhelmed the global outlook. With increasing risks to growth and \ufb01nancial stability, policy authorities need to steer a knife-edge course to avoid a crash landing. ", "file8": "Domestic economic activity is normalising after the ferocious second wave retarded momentum. The outlook remains overcast by the future path of the pandemic; the accelerated pace of vaccination and release of pent-up demand provide an upside to the baseline growth path. Headline inflation has fallen back into the tolerance band and the trajectory is expected to be driven by supply-side factors. A faster resolution of supply chain disruptions, good foodgrains production and effective supply management could cause inflation to undershoot the baseline, contingent on the evolution of the pandemic and the efficacy of vaccines. In the months following the retention of the in\ufb02ation target at 4 per cent with a +/- 2 per cent tolerance band around it for the period 2021-26 by the Government of India (GoI) on March 31, 2021, the monetary policy framework faced a testing challenge from a shock price spike in May 2021. In addition to pandemic-induced disruptions that shaped the trajectory of in\ufb02ation during the \ufb01rst wave, spillovers from the hardening of commodity prices, especially of crude and edible oil, propelled headline in\ufb02ation above the upper tolerance band. The episode was short-lived though and in\ufb02ation has fallen back into the tolerance band. The monetary policy committee (MPC) decided to look through this shock, reading it as supply-driven and transitory. In its meetings in June and August, the MPC maintained status quo on the policy rate and committed to remain accommodative as long as it takes to revive and sustain growth and mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the economy. Developments in the real economy in the \ufb01rst half of 2021-22 have vindicated this stance \u2013 shorn of statistical base effects, aggregate demand trails below pre-pandemic levels and considerable slack still prevails in the economy, especially in contact-dependent sectors that faced the brunt of the pandemic. In the second quarter of 2021-22, however, a hesitant recovery is underway, nurtured by the appreciable decline in infections, the stepping up of the scale and speed of vaccinations, and the congenial \ufb01nancial conditions engendered by monetary policy. Since the release of the April 2021 Monetary Policy Report (MPR), the global macroeconomic environment has been unsettled by diverging paths of economies across the world, between advanced and emerging economies and also among them, mainly differentiated by vaccine access. This is re\ufb02ected most vividly in monetary policy actions and stances, with some of them staying the course of remaining accommodative and supporting growth and others pre-emptively tightening monetary policy on the assessment that in\ufb02ation presents a bigger risk. Decoupling of growth paths and the disconnect in monetary policy responses pose downside risks to the global recovery, which already appears to be losing steam. Global economic conditions are also besieged by the resurgence of in\ufb02ation across the world. Some central banks, mostly in advanced economies (AEs), have judged the rise in in\ufb02ation as transitory, while some others, mostly in emerging market economies (EMEs) regard breaches of upper tolerance bands as unacceptable and growth threatening. Financial markets are trying to second- guess the commencement of normalisation. Episodic shifts in risk appetite have rendered equity markets frothy with stretched valuations, with intermittent \ufb02ights into and out of the safety of bonds. Meanwhile, EMEs are awash with capital \ufb02ows and rotations thereof on taper talk and carry trade and currencies have turned volatile as a result. Several countries that had unlocked their economies and encouraged mobility have faced renewed surges of infections from the Delta variant of the virus, which has turned the evolving global outlook highly uncertain and fragile. Global growth has been supported by strong external demand on the back of buoyant merchandise trade. The World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) goods trade barometer hit a high in June 2021 reading. The 20-point year-on-year (y-o-y) rise in the index re\ufb02ects both the strength of the recent trade expansion and the depth of the pandemic-induced shock in 2020. Worryingly, though, the rate of increase in the index has started to come off, presaging a peaking of the upward momentum in world trade. Container shortages, increased port turnover time and three major shipping alliances controlling much of the supplies have resulted in a jump in freight rates putting the sustainability of the global trade expansion at risk. Services trade continues to lag merchandise trade, with signi\ufb01cant contraction in international travel services, although in Q2 some improvement is evident, including through revenge tourism, and increase in transport and other goods related services boosted by demand for goods and freight rates. In India, the recovery that was taking hold from the second half of 2020-21 was disrupted by the second wave of COVID-19 in the weeks following the release of the April 2021 MPR. Although the ferocity of the second wave was not anticipated, the loss of output was about 40 per cent less than during the \ufb01rst wave, as adaptation to pandemic protocols limited restrictions to containment measures instead of the nation-wide lockdown that was enforced during the \ufb01rst wave. Nevertheless, in\ufb02ationary pressures became accentuated, as set out earlier, with erosion in \ufb01scal positions. Against this backdrop, the pace of domestic economic activity in Q1:2021-22 (April-June) turned out to be somewhat localised weaker than anticipated in the April MPR and remained below 2019-20 levels. High frequency indicators of activity suggest that the economy may be pulling out of the second wave\u2019s impact, but uncertainty about the incidence of the third wave makes the outlook fraught with risks. Thus, to have an overwhelming in\ufb02uence on global and domestic macroeconomic Virus mutations threaten the progress made through vaccinations and medical responses. Infections keep \ufb02aring up in various geographies, forcing authorities to re- impose restrictions/lockdowns restraining economic activity. At the same time, greater adaptability, rising vaccination coverage and continuation of policy support are working towards mitigating the effects of new waves of the pandemic. Equal and universal vaccination holds the key to a brighter outlook, both globally and domestically. the pandemic continues During April-September 2021, the MPC met thrice. In the April meeting, the MPC noted that supply side pressures on in\ufb02ation could persist while demand-side pull remains moderate. On the gross domestic product (GDP) growth outlook, the jump in COVID-19 infections in certain parts of the country and the associated localised lockdowns were seen as dampening the demand for contact-intensive services, restraining growth impulses and prolonging the return to normalcy. In such an environment, the MPC observed that continued policy support remained necessary and unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that in\ufb02ation remained within the target going forward. In the June 2021 meeting, the MPC observed that the rising trajectory of international commodity prices, especially of crude, together with logistics costs, posed upside risks to the in\ufb02ation outlook with weak demand conditions tempering the pass-through to core in\ufb02ation. On the growth outlook, the MPC noted that the second wave of COVID-19 had altered the near-term outlook, and policy support from all sides \u2013 \ufb01scal, monetary and sectoral \u2013 was required to nurture recovery and expedite return to normalcy. Accordingly, the MPC decided unanimously to maintain status quo on the policy repo rate and continue with the accommodative stance. When the MPC met in August, headline in\ufb02ation had breached the upper threshold for the second month in succession in June due to strong momentum in the May print running across all the major sub- groups. The MPC assessed that the in\ufb02ationary pressures were largely driven by transitory supply shocks while stressing that it was conscious of its objective of anchoring in\ufb02ation expectations. On growth, the MPC noted that the outlook for aggregate demand was improving, but it was still weak and there was a large amount of slack in the economy, with output below its pre-pandemic level. It judged that the nascent and hesitant recovery needed to be nurtured. Accordingly, the MPC decided unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and on a 5 to 1 majority to continue with the accommodative stance. The MPC\u2019s voting pattern on the policy repo rate re\ufb02ected broader setting during H1:2021-22 unanimity and assessments in members\u2019 expectations, mirroring the voting outcomes in a number of other central banks (Table I.1). Chapters II and III analyse the macroeconomic developments during H1:2021-22 (April-September). For the updated projections set out in this Chapter, in the baseline assumptions as set out below First, global crude oil prices have hardened rebound in demand and regulated production by the (OPEC) plus. Crude prices initially eased from July plus to increase production by 0.4 million barrels per day on a monthly basis starting August and the moderation in demand due to renewed surge in COVID-19 infections. Crude prices, however, hardened again in August-September on supply Taking into account these developments, crude prices (Indian basket) are assumed at US$ 75 per barrel in Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. Second, the nominal exchange rate (the Indian rupee or INR vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar) has exhibited two-way movements in a range of INR 72-75 per US dollar since April 2021. After depreciating in early-April on concerns about the economic fallout from the second wave, the INR remained under appreciating pressures until May 2021. It depreciated again in June on a strengthening US dollar and rising crude oil prices. The INR appreciated in August with the resumption of portfolio \ufb02ows, but this was reversed in September. Taking these developments into consideration, the exchange rate is assumed at INR demand has been stronger than the April MPR in recent months over renewed infections and persisting global supply-demand imbalances in key V). Growth prospects of AEs have improved \ufb01scal support relative to emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) (Chart I.2). After a global merchandise trade has slowed, weighed down by elevated shipping charges and logistics costs. The global manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) remained in expansion at 54.1 in September supply chain issues continued to hinder output Consumer price index (CPI) in\ufb02ation breached the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent in May and June 2021 driven by supply-side pressures in food, fuel and core in\ufb02ation.

Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in September 2021 expect CPI in\ufb02ation to ease from 5.3 per cent in August 2021 to 4.7 per cent in Q3:2021-22 and subsequently move up to 5.7 per cent in Q4:2021-22 before easing to 4.9 per cent in Q2:2022-23 (Chart I.5).4 per cent in Q3, and 5.8 per cent in Q4, with risks broadly balanced (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent con\ufb01dence intervals for headline in\ufb02ation in Q4:2021-22 are 4.4-7.2 per cent and 3.6-8.0 per cent, respectively. For 2022-23, assuming a normalisation of supply chains on the back of improved vaccination, a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that in\ufb02ation will move in a range of 4.5-5.2 per cent. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent con\ufb01dence intervals for Q4:2022-23 are 2.7-6.3 per cent and 1.7-7.2 per cent, respectively. Kharif sowing has progressed satisfactorily and foodgrains production is estimated to touch a new record which, along with ample buffer stocks of foodgrains, should help to contain cereal prices. Global food, oil and other commodity prices, however, remain \ufb01rm. Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from structural and other time-series models, CPI in\ufb02ation is projected to move from 5.6 per cent during Q1:2021-22 to 5.1 per cent in Q2, 4.5 There are a number of upside and downside risks to the baseline in\ufb02ation forecasts. The upside risks emanate from a longer-than-expected persistence of supply chain disruptions; a further hardening of global commodity prices, especially that of crude oil; a quicker pass-through of input cost pressures to output prices on the back of strong pent-up domestic demand from ebbing infections and vaccination-led Note: The fan chart depicts uncertainty around the baseline projection path.

The downside risks arise from an earlier than expected mending of supply chain disruptions; the persistence of weak demand and slack in the economy; and corrections in global commodity and crude prices in the event of a weakening of global demand over new mutants and poor vaccination coverage in low- income countries. With the ebbing of the second wave, a phased relaxation of localised restrictions, and improving vaccine coverage, economic activity has been normalising gradually since June 2021. Looking ahead, prospects for the agricultural sector and rural demand look promising, supported by the late revival in kharif sowing. Urban demand is also likely to accelerate with the release of pent-up demand, aided by the significant expansion in the pace of vaccination since July and improving consumer confidence \u2013 as of October 6, 2021, nearly 27 per cent of India\u2019s adult population has been fully vaccinated, while 71 per cent has received one dose. This augurs well for the sustenance of contact-intensive activities and consumption demand. The government\u2019s focus on capital expenditure and continued reform push, large foreign direct investment flows, congenial monetary and financial conditions, and boom in the initial public offerings provide a conducive environment for investment activity. There are signs that the investment pipeline could increase in the rest of 2021-22 and in the coming year, given the interest in the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the continued focus on road infrastructure. Turning to the key messages from forward-looking surveys, the consumer con\ufb01dence (the current situation index) in the September 2021 round recovered marginally from the all-time low recorded in May-July 2021, while index for the year ahead remained in the optimistic zone, driven by recovery in sentiments on the general economic situation, the employment scenario and household spending (Chart I.7).5 Sentiments in the manufacturing sector for the quarter ahead strengthened further in the July- September 2021 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, re\ufb02ecting optimism on production, order books, capacity utilisation, and employment (Chart I.8). Services and infrastructure sectors expect further strengthening in overall business situation and turnover in Q3:2021-22. Surveys by other agencies released during May-July generally reported a decline in business expectations over the previous rounds but remained upbeat from 5 The survey is conducted by the Reserve Bank in 13 major cities and the September 2021 round is based on responses from 5,237 respondents. a year ago (Table I.3). According to the purchasing managers\u2019 survey for September 2021, the one year ahead business expectations of \ufb01rms in the manufacturing and services sectors were optimistic albeit below historical levels.

GDP growth to move from 20.1 per cent in Q1:2021- 22 to 5.9 per cent in Q4; it is expected at 13.1 per cent in Q1:2022-23 due to base effects and 6.1 per cent in Q2 (Chart I.9). While the near-term prospects are bolstered by the lower base of last year, the outlook is contingent on the evolving COVID-19 trajectory. Taking into account the Q1 growth of 20.1 per cent, baseline assumptions, survey indicators, and model forecasts, real GDP growth is projected at 9.5 per cent in 2021- 22 \u20137.9 per cent in Q2, 6.8 per cent in Q3, and 6.1 per cent in Q4 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path (Chart I.10 and Table I.4). For 2022-23, the structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 7.8 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 5.0-17.2 per cent, assuming restoration of supply chains, a normal monsoon, no major exogenous or policy shocks, and full vaccination. There are upside and downside risks to the baseline growth path. Stronger-than-expected pent-up demand amidst a faster pace of vaccination and mild variants of the virus, and government\u2019s focus on infrastructure Credit growth of scheduled commercial banks Combined gross \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit (per cent of GDP) investment and asset monetisation and reform measures provide an upside to the baseline growth path. On the contrary, new and more contagious variants of the virus, elevated levels of crude oil and commodity prices, more persistent pandemic-related domestic as well as global supply bottlenecks and global \ufb01nancial market volatility pose downside risks to the baseline growth path. The baseline projections of in\ufb02ation and growth presented in the previous sections are premised on the assumptions relating to key domestic and international macroeconomic and \ufb01nancial conditions set out in Table I.2. The inherent uncertainties around these assumptions, exacerbated by COVID-19 and its Note: The fan chart depicts uncertainty around the baseline projection path.

Source: RBI staff estimates. variants, have a signi\ufb01cant bearing on the in\ufb02ation and growth trajectories. Some plausible alternative scenarios to assess the balance of risks around the baseline projections are presented in this section. While the global growth outlook has been upgraded relative to the April MPR, it remains highly susceptible to COVID-19\u2019s trajectory in view of the uneven spread of vaccination across countries and more contagious new variants of the virus, apart from volatility in global commodity prices and the elevated uncertainty over US monetary policy normalisation. First, continuing global supply chain disruptions are adversely in several manufacturing impacting production activities and could dampen global growth more than currently anticipated with additional headwinds from the steep increase in natural gas prices in recent weeks. Second, a slowing Chinese economy may drag down external demand. Third, if the in\ufb02ationary the demand-supply from pressures emanating bottlenecks in the US and other AEs were to turn out to be persistent, it could trigger an earlier exit than currently being telegraphed from the accommodative policies in the major AEs, induce large \ufb01nancial market volatility and pose downside risks to global growth. Fourth, an escalation of geo-political tensions remains a potential source of downside risk to global growth. In such a scenario, if the global recovery slips by 100 bps below the baseline, domestic growth and in\ufb02ation could be lower by around 40 bps and 30 bps, respectively. Conversely, a more widespread and equitable distribution of vaccines across the world, sustained success in containing the spread of new mutants, faster resolution of logistic bottlenecks, and the spike in in\ufb02ation in major AEs reversing quickly could boost global economic activity. In such a scenario, assuming that global growth surprises by 100 bps on the upside, domestic growth and in\ufb02ation could edge higher by around 40 bps and 30 bps, respectively (Charts I.11a and I.12a). plus. The supply-demand dynamics in the global oil market are subject to several uncertainties. On the supply side, shortfall in the OPEC plus production and rise in geo-political tensions could constrain supply and increase oil prices above the baseline. On the demand side, a better containment of COVID-19 infections could induce higher global growth, a faster closing of the global output gap and a sharper increase in international crude oil prices. Assuming crude oil prices to be 10 per cent above the baseline (Table I.2), domestic in\ufb02ation could be higher by 30 bps and growth weaker by around 20 bps over the baseline. Conversely, crude oil prices could soften below the baseline if the global recovery is more subdued owing to a faster spread of virus mutations, delays in vaccination or improved supplies of shale gas. In this scenario, if the price of the crude falls by 10 per cent relative to the baseline, in\ufb02ation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 20 bps to growth (Charts I.11a and I.12a). International crude oil prices have \ufb01rmed up amidst elevated volatility with the gradual resumption in economic activity, improvement in global demand and calibrated output normalisation by the OPEC The INR has exhibited two-way movements over the past six months, re\ufb02ecting both global and domestic factors. The divergent paths of recovery across AEs and EMEs and the risk of currently elevated in\ufb02ation in AEs acquiring a more structural character could necessitate an early exit from ultra-accommodative monetary policies by the AE central banks. The resultant heightened volatility in global \ufb01nancial markets could lead to a generalised risk aversion to EMEs assets, capital out\ufb02ows and downward pressures on their currencies (Box I.1). A 5 per cent depreciation of INR from the baseline (Table I.2) in Capital \ufb02ows to EMEs ease external \ufb01nancing constraints and help to increase domestic investment and growth. On the other hand, such \ufb02ows are often volatile and prone to sudden stops and reversals, causing disorderly movements in the exchange rate that can feed into domestic in\ufb02ation and output. These effects are ampli\ufb01ed by interactions with equity and bond markets and derivative positions. Furthermore, undesirable and unintended \ufb02uctuations in liquidity resulting from volatile capital \ufb02ows can vitiate the monetary policy stance (Das, 2021). The macroeconomic implications of capital \ufb02ows for the Indian economy can be analysed through the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM)6 (RBI, 2021) under alternative scenarios. In Scenario 1, the central bank allows the impact of capital \ufb02ows to be borne out fully by the exchange rate with no monetary action. In Scenario 2, movements in the exchange rate pass through into in\ufb02ation, causing a deviation of in\ufb02ation from the target that prompts monetary policy action. Alternatively, the central bank may resort to a judicious combination 6 The QPM is a semi-structural, forward-looking, open economy, calibrated, gap model in the New Keynesian tradition and provides an internally consistent analysis of various feedback mechanisms (RBI, 2021). of forex intervention and sterilisation, exchange rate adjustment and monetary policy action (Scenario 3) to contain the impact of the volatility in capital \ufb02ows on the domestic economy. support of growth. The Reserve Bank of India undertakes markets to stabilise \ufb01nancial markets and liquidity In Scenario 1, there is a sustained deviation of in\ufb02ation from the target (Chart I.1.1). In\ufb02ation deviations are relatively contained in scenario 2 but this comes at the cost of volatility in output because monetary policy is calibrated to bring in\ufb02ation back to the target. Scenario 3, which involves forex intervention and sterilisation, helps to insulate the domestic economy from the capital \ufb02ows shock, with only marginal impact on in\ufb02ation and output. This policy combination reduces volatility in the forex market and helps the central bank to pursue conditions so that monetary policy retains its domestic orientation and the independence to pursue national such a scenario could increase domestic in\ufb02ation by up to 20 bps, while GDP growth could be higher by 15 bps through a boost to exports. On the other hand, given India\u2019s relatively better growth outlook, boost to growth from the expanding scale of vaccination and reform measures by the government to attract foreign capital, INR could appreciate. In such a scenario, if the INR appreciates by 5 per cent relative to the baseline, in\ufb02ation and growth could moderate Food in\ufb02ation moderated in July-August from the recent peak in June 2021, driven largely by the deepening de\ufb02ation of vegetable prices. In\ufb02ation in edible oil prices, however, remains substantially elevated at 33.0 per cent in August. The expectations of record kharif foodgrains production and large buffer stocks for cereals augur well for food prices. These developments along with continued effective supply management of key food items and easing of international food prices could soften headline in\ufb02ation by around 50 bps. Conversely, a further hardening of international food prices, demand- supply imbalances in some food items and unseasonal rainfall could exert upward pressure on headline in\ufb02ation by around 50 bps (Charts I.11b and I.12b). Domestic economic activity is normalising after the ferocious second wave retarded momentum. The outlook remains overcast by the future path of the pandemic; however, the accelerated progress in the upcoming festival season, boost to investment activity and liquidity conditions provide an upside to the baseline growth path. While the in\ufb02ation trajectory is expected to be driven by supply-side factors and risks are to the upside, a faster resolution of global management, could cause in\ufb02ation to undershoot Consumer price index (CPI) inflation remained highly volatile during March-August this year \u2013 after moderating close to the target rate in April, it rose abruptly to breach the upper tolerance threshold during May-June with a sharp pickup in food, fuel and core inflation and moderated in July-August on substantial softening in food inflation. Costs of farm and non-farm inputs remained elevated. Nominal rural wages for both agricultural and non- agricultural labourers were stagnant while staff costs in the organised sector rose. Since the publication of the April 2021 MPR, headline CPI in\ufb02ation1 that had fallen close to the target rate of 4.0 per cent in April, sprang back amidst the second wave of intense infections to breach the upper tolerance threshold and touched 6.3 per cent during May-June 2021.2 This unanticipated spike came from a sharp pick-up in food and core (CPI excluding food and fuel3) in\ufb02ation which peaked peaked at 6.6 per cent in May 2021 \u2013 the highest since May 2014, and was the then highest recorded in the CPI series. In moderated by one percentage point to 5.3 per cent by August on a substantial softening in food in\ufb02ation even as fuel infation scaled another high and core in\ufb02ation remained sticky and elevated. On the whole, CPI in\ufb02ation has been highly volatile in the \ufb01ve months of the current \ufb01nancial year \u2013 moving within a wide range of 4.2 per cent to 6.3 per cent \u2013 averaging 5.5 per cent (Chart II.1). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual in\ufb02ation outcomes from projections, if any, and explain the underlying reasons thereof. The April 2021 MPR had projected Note: The imputed CPI prints for April and May 2020 have been regarded as a break in the CPI series. Sources: National Statistical Of\ufb01ce (NSO); and RBI staff estimates. 1 Headline in\ufb02ation is measured by year-on-year changes in all-India consumer price index \u2013 combined (CPI-C). 2 CPI in\ufb02ation for April-May 2021 was computed based on imputed CPI indices for April-May 2020. 3 Core CPI, i.e. CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups \u2018food and beverages\u2019 and \u2018fuel and light\u2019 from the headline CPI. range-bound movement in CPI in\ufb02ation \u2013 an average of 5.0 per cent in Q4:2020-21 to 5.2 per cent in Q1 and Q2 of 2021-22. Actual in\ufb02ation for Q1:2021-22 at 5.6 per cent and Q2:2021-22 (July-August) at 5.4 per cent turned out to be higher than the projections by 35 bps and 27 bps, respectively (Chart II.2). A number of factors impinging on food, fuel and core contributed to this overshoot. First, the rapid spread of COVID-19\u2019s second wave at the start of 2021-22 resulted in restrictions on activity being imposed over a large swath of the country. These restrictions, in turn, resulted in transitory price pressures in Q1, especially in May, through supply-chain disruptions, elevated retail margins as well as from dif\ufb01culties in accurate price measurements due to localised lockdowns and restrictions on non-essential commercial activities in several states.4 As restrictions eased and activity normalised, the effects of these factors dissipated from June. Second, the unanticipated surge in global energy prices kept petrol and diesel in\ufb02ation \ufb01rmly in double digits. The April 2021 MPR had assumed an Indian basket crude oil price of US$ 64.6 per barrel during 2021-22; however, crude oil prices edged up to a peak level of US$ 75 per barrel in early July before moderating to US$ 70 per barrel by end-August. Third, there was an extraordinary surge in international edible oil prices which fed into domestic in\ufb02ation formation.5 Fourth, the persistence of industrial input and transport cost pressures and subsequent transmission to selling prices of manufactured goods was more than what was anticipated, in spite of demand conditions weakening due to the second wave. A dip in in\ufb02ation to 4.2 per cent in April 2021 was overwhelmed in May 2021 by a sharp pick up in price momentum6 spanning across food, fuel and core groups, resulting in a surge in in\ufb02ation by 2.1 percentage points to 6.3 per cent. In June, headline in\ufb02ation plateaued, with positive price momentum completely neutralised by a favourable base effect which became even larger in July and more than offset the broad-based price momentum taking down headline in\ufb02ation to 5.6 per cent in July. With overall price momentum registering a sharp deceleration in August, coming from a steady food price index, headline in\ufb02ation moderated further to 5.3 per cent (Chart II.3). The distribution of CPI in\ufb02ation during January- August 2021 varied distinctly from the pattern in the past few years. There has been a shift in the In May 2021, the market-wise price reporting fell to 68.1 per cent in rural areas (from 84.6 per cent in April 2021 and 89.1 per cent in March 2021) and 67.5 per cent in urban areas (from 87.4 per cent in April 2021 and 93.6 per cent in March 2021). 5 About 58 per cent of the domestic consumption of edible oil is imported. 6 A change in CPI year-on-year (y-o-y) in\ufb02ation between any two months is the difference between the current month-on-month (m-o-m) change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details, see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. d: CPI excluding Food and Fuel Note: The y-o-y in\ufb02ation for April and May 2021 have been calculated based on the imputed index for April and May 2020 released by NSO.

This was accompanied by an increase in volatility \u2013 with the standard deviation in 2021 more skewness, compared to a negative skew for the 2017-2019 period. These indicate high dispersion of number of items experiencing higher in\ufb02ation rates than in the pre-pandemic period. The positive skew re\ufb02ected outlier double-digit in\ufb02ation in the CPI Oils and fats Transport and communication Fuel and light Health Meat and \ufb01sh Housing Prepared meals, snacks, sweets etc. Clothing Total CPI-Combined contributed 82.7 per cent of CPI in\ufb02ation, much higher than their contribution of 56.2 per cent in 2020-21 (Table II.1). The non-seasonally adjusted diffusion indices of price changes7 remained elevated (barring for services in June), indicative of price increases being broad-based across the CPI basket (Chart II.5).8 impinging upon The in\ufb02ation dynamics can be captured through vector autoregression (VAR) estimates and historical decomposition.9 In\ufb02ationary pressures in Q1:2021-22 can be attributed to adverse supply shocks, \ufb01rming up of asset prices and easy monetary conditions, even as muted demand conditions contributed to a softening of in\ufb02ationary pressures. By Q2:2021-22 some softening in in\ufb02ationary pressures came about from softening of wage pressures (Chart II.6a). In terms of contribution of goods and services to headline in\ufb02ation, the pick-up in in\ufb02ation in June In view of the non-availability of CPI item level data for the period March-May 2020, the diffusion indices have been constructed with item level indices without seasonal adjustment. 8 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. A reading above 50 for the diffusion index signals a broad expansion or generalisation of price increases and a reading below 50 signals broad-based price decline. 9 Historical decomposition estimates the contribution of each shock to the movements in in\ufb02ation over the sample period (Q4:2010-11 to Q1:2021-22) based on a vector autoregression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 crude oil prices; exchange rate (INR per US$), asset price (BSE Sensex), CPI; the output gap; rural wages; the policy repo rate; and money supply (M3). All variables other than policy repo rate are growth rates. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et; where et represents a vector of shocks. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of in\ufb02ation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. 2021 emanated from perishables \u2013 edible oils, fruits semi-perishables, durables and services to headline in\ufb02ation were largely steady (Chart II.6b). Some of the stickiness in semi-perishables and durables goods in\ufb02ation re\ufb02ected the transmission of high international prices. of perishables to headline in\ufb02ation registered a The surge in international prices of edible oil, silver and petroleum products resulted in an increase in Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI. 10 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modi\ufb01ed mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Of\ufb01ce (NSSO).

Excluding vegetables, during April-August 2021, food and headline in\ufb02ation would have averaged 6.3 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively, as against an overall average rate of 4.3 per cent for food and 5.5 per cent for headline. Food and beverages in\ufb02ation treaded within a range of 2-6 per cent during March-August 2021 and on an average contributed around 37.2 per cent of headline in\ufb02ation (CPI food has a weight of 45.9 per cent in the CPI basket). Elevated international prices of edible oils along with price pressures in protein rich items remained the major drivers (Chart II.7). The summer uptick in vegetables prices during May-July 2021 led to an increase in price pressures, while a decline in prices of cereals, protein-based food and fruits along with a sharp deceleration in vegetable price momentum in August 2021 provided relief dragging down food in\ufb02ation to 3.8 per cent. Overall, the food price build-up in the \ufb01nancial year so far has been lower than historical patterns, even as price build-ups in oils and fats, eggs, meat and \ufb01sh, non- Prices of cereals (weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group) remained in de\ufb02ation during March-August 2021, primarily re\ufb02ecting favourable base effects and muted momentum. Within cereals, both rice and wheat witnessed subdued price pressures (barring May 2021) on the back of ample buffer stocks relative to norms (2.7 times and 1.8 times for rice and wheat, respectively, as on September 16, 2021) and distribution under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). In May 2021, restrictions on activity across many states affected supply chains leading to a pick up in prices. Moreover, production remained robust, with an increase of 2.9 per cent for rice and 1.5 per cent for wheat (as per the 4th Advance Estimates (AE) 2020-21) over 2019-20 Final Estimates (FE).

On the whole, as noted earlier, the price build-up in vegetables remained lower than their In a rapidly changing scenario where volatility in prices of key vegetables has substantial fallout on headline in\ufb02ation, there is a need for real time monitoring of price situation, especially in case of perishables. Price sentiment derived from unstructured data contained in news articles can provide useful leading information on prices (Box II.1). Strengthening market intelligence on high-impact food items is an integral element in in\ufb02ation forecasting framework of the Reserve Bank. Newspaper articles provide information on local events that may lead to large swings in nation-wide retail food prices. Unstructured textual data in news items can be processed and quanti\ufb01ed using text-mining techniques to analyse the nature of shocks and in\ufb02ation dynamics. Three main vegetables viz., tomatoes, onions and potatoes (TOP), with a combined weight of 2.2 per cent in the CPI, have high contribution to variance in food price in\ufb02ation (Chart II.1.1). A lexicon-based approach was adopted for computation of commodity-wise sentiment index, based on news items published in nine leading news dailies during the period 2016-202011. For each commodity-speci\ufb01c news item, the Loughran-McDonald lexicon, designed speci\ufb01cally for analysing economic and \ufb01nancial texts was used to assign a sentiment score to each published polarized word occurring in a news article at time (Loughran and McDonald, 2011). \u2018Positive\u2019 (indicating easing in prices) and \u2018negative\u2019 (indicating increase in prices) words were assigned a sentiment score of (+1) and (-1), respectively. A sentiment score ( ) was computed at the document level such that represents the total number of polarized words and is the total number of words in a news article. The document-wise sentiment score was aggregated across time such that represents the time-series for the \ufb01nal net sentiment score (NSS), where is total number of news articles for the given commodity on day \u2018t\u2019. Accordingly, a positive sentiment score indicates an expected fall in prices, while a negative sentiment score suggests an expected increase in prices. Note: * Covers April 2019 to February 2020, as item level data for March-May 2020 were not released by NSO. 11 Measured using words occurring in each news article, sentiments in this context can be construed to convey optimism (decrease) or pessimism (increase) about the price situation of a given commodity. For the analysis, a novel dataset of daily news items published in nine leading news dailies during 2016-2020 was constructed and \ufb01ltered based on occurrence of keywords encompassing \u2018supply\u2019, \u2018demand\u2019 and \u2018prices\u2019 of TOP commodities. The framework laid down by Ardia et al. (2021) was used for sentiment computation and analysis. Note: The shaded areas in graphs represent the following episodes: Tomato: (I) Heatwave affected production (II) Farmers\u2019 protests (III) Excess rains; Onion: (I) Excess rains (II) Late withdrawal of monsoon (III) Excess rains; Potato: (I) Low production \u2013 blight in West Bengal (II) Low production (III) Low storage. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. Monthly net sentiment score of TOP and changes in their prices as re\ufb02ected in CPI show a negative relationship between them, as expected (Chart II.1.2). Large increases in TOP prices seen after major supply shocks coincide with large fall in sentiment related to each of the three commodities. Sentiments were found to \u2018Granger cause\u2019 change in prices, implying the predictive power of news-based sentiment in capturing future price movements of TOP. The results show that NSS can provide forward-looking information for price movements in TOP (up to 30 days as per the Granger causality test), which could be useful for nowcasting of food price in\ufb02ation.

Despite pulses production of 257.2 lakh tonnes during 2020-21, an increase of 11.7 per cent over 2019-20 \u2013 augmenting domestic supply and overall stocks, factors like localised lockdowns in the second wave resulted in supply chain driven demand- supply gaps, accentuated by lower arrival of imports and precarious stock positions in the case of masur (Chart II.10). To address the tight demand supply situation, the government undertook several supply side initiatives such as imposing stock limits in July 2021 on some pulses under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, easing import restrictions to enhance domestic availability of tur, urad and moong, a memorandum of understanding (MoUs) with Myanmar, Malawi and Mozambique for pulses imports, and reducing basic import duty and Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) on masur to 0 per cent12 and 10 per cent, respectively. In\ufb02ation in meat, \ufb01sh and eggs witnessed upside pressures during March-July 2021 primarily re\ufb02ecting transportation costs feed cost pressures and (Chart II.11a). Prices of key items such as eggs, chicken, mutton and \ufb01sh surged as a consequence of several factors \u2013 increase in soybean meal prices (international soybean meal prices increased by 32.3 per cent in July 2021 compared to July 2020); restricted operations of the poultry industry during the second wave; festive demand in July 2021; damage of \ufb01shing boats owing to cyclones Tauktae and Yaas; higher fuel prices and the annual ban on \ufb01shing in the west coast during monsoons. However, prices eased in August 2021 re\ufb02ecting seasonal fall in demand during the month of sravana. In the case of milk and products (weight of 6.6 per cent in the CPI and 14.4 per cent in the food and beverages group), a lean season of production coincided with upward revision in retail prices by ` 2 per litre by major milk co-operatives like Amul and Mother Dairy in July 2021 which was followed by many other state milk co-operatives such as Milkfed in Punjab, Gokul in Maharashtra and Parag in Uttar Pradesh, resulting in price pressures in July 2021. Milk cooperatives have cited various reasons for increase in input costs such as cost of transport, feed prices and operational costs of processing and packaging. However, post July 2021, no increase in retail milk prices by other milk cooperatives has been reported. In\ufb02ation in oils and fats experienced price pressures in the post-lockdown period and shot up to an all-time high of 34.8 per cent in June 2021, mirroring elevated international edible oil prices (Chart II.11b). Prices fell in July 2021 in response to the supply side measures announced by the government, before showing some uptick in August to 33.0 per cent. Global palm oil prices escalated due to labour shortage in Malaysia and adverse weather conditions leading to lower than expected production and high export duties on crude palm oil. A number of measures were taken to alleviate price pressures, including reduction in import duty on crude and re\ufb01ned palm oil from 15.0 per cent to 10.0 per cent (effective rate reduced from 35.75 per cent to 30.25 per cent) and 45.0 per cent to 37.5 per cent (effective rate reduced from 49.5 per cent to 41.25 per cent), respectively; mechanism for speedy clearance of crude palm oil at shipping ports and placing the imports of Re\ufb01ned Bleached Deodorized (RBD) palm oil and RBD palmolein under free category from restricted category effective from June 30, 2021 and applicable till December 31, 2021. Further, effective September 11, 2021, import duty on crude and re\ufb01ned palm oil was reduced from 10 per cent to 2.5 per cent (effective rate reduced from 30.25 per cent to 24.75 per cent) and 37.5 per cent to 32.5 per cent (effective rate reduced from 41.25 per cent to 35.75 per cent), respectively. However, price pressures continued in the domestic market (barring in July 2021) as Malaysia increased its export reference price for July 2021, maintaining its export duty at the highest rate of 8.0 per cent. To control domestic edible oil prices, import duty on crude soybean and sun\ufb02ower oil were reduced from 15.0 per cent to 7.5 per cent, effective August 20, 2021 and it was further reduced to 2.5 per cent from September 11, 2021. Similarly, import duty on re\ufb01ned soybean and sun\ufb02ower oils was reduced from 45.0 per cent to 37.5 per cent and further to 32.5 per cent with the same effective dates. To attain self-suf\ufb01ciency in production of edible oil, the Government announced a National Mission on Edible Oil - Oil Palm (NMEO- OP) with an investment of over `11,000 crore and assured farmers access to all facilities, from quality seeds to technology.

Price of sugar and confectionery (weight of 1.4 per cent in the CPI and 3.0 per cent in the food and beverages group) remained in de\ufb02ation during March- August 2021, except for June 2021, due to higher domestic availability as a result of robust production (sugarcane production rose by 7.8 per cent in 2020-21 4th AE over 2019-20 FE) and export subsidy for sugar export under MAEQ (Maximum Admissible Export Quota) being reduced to `4000 per tonne from `6000 per tonne, effective May 20, 2021. Retail price margins, de\ufb01ned as the difference between retail and wholesale prices for four major sub-groups \u2013 cereals, pulses, vegetables and edible oil \u2013 have shown divergent movements.13 The margins in case of edible oils, pulses and cereals have risen unceasingly, since the \ufb01rst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Margins in case of vegetables are back to the usual seasonal pattern in absence of any major supply side disturbance (Chart II.12). Among other items in the CPI food group, prices \ufb01rmed up in the case of non-alcoholic beverages and prepared meals, re\ufb02ecting increase in input costs. CPI fuel in\ufb02ation surged from 4.4 per cent in March 2021 to 12.6 per cent in June 2021 before showing a 13 Item level retail and wholesale prices sourced from the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) are aggregated at respective subgroup using item level CPI weights. Data for January-March 2021 have been excluded due to changes in price collection mechanism and item varieties by DCA. transitory dip in July. In August 2021, fuel in\ufb02ation touched an all-time high of 12.9 per cent (Chart II.13a). The year-on-year price changes in LPG and kerosene (PDS) during June-August 2021 were one of the highest recorded in the current CPI series. Market prices of crude and various oil-based fuels have \ufb01rmed up through the waves of the pandemic pulling up kerosene and LPG fuel prices (Chart II.13c). The \ufb01rewood and chips was also substantial during June- CPI core in\ufb02ation, i.e. CPI in\ufb02ation excluding food and fuel, remained elevated and sticky in the \ufb01nancial year so far, re\ufb02ecting persistent cost-push pressures Notes: (1) The international price for LPG is based on spot prices for Saudi Butane and Propane, combined in the ratio of 60:40 respectively.

Core in\ufb02ation, from a peak level of 6.6 per cent in May, moderated to 6.1 per cent in June and to 5.8 per cent during July-August. Excluding petrol and diesel, it has also remained sticky in the range of 5.1-5.5 per cent throughout the pandemic period (Table II.2). In term of sub-groups, transport and communication, clothing and footwear and health accounted for more than 60 per cent of core in\ufb02ation (weight of these sub-groups is around 45 per cent in the core CPI). On the other hand, the contributions of housing and education sub-groups to core in\ufb02ation in the \ufb01nancial year so far have been lower than in the pre-pandemic period (Chart II.14). Overall, goods in\ufb02ation is driving the core, with petrol and diesel (under the transportation and communication sub-group) registering double digit in\ufb02ation consecutively since July 2020. Even as the one-off effects of indirect taxes instituted in the post- lockdown period waned from June 2021, the sustained increase in international crude oil prices \u2013 by around 104 per cent between end-May 2020 and end-August 2021 \u2013 has kept petrol and diesel in\ufb02ation \ufb01rm at 23.8 per cent in August. This was starkly evident in the WPI which excluded indirect tax effects; WPI petrol and diesel in\ufb02ation was at 54.2 per cent in August (Chart II.15a). Petrol pump prices were at historic highs in early 2021 and breached `100 per litre by After abstracting the effects of generally volatile core in\ufb02ation rose from 5.1 per cent in February to 5.5 per cent in August, attesting to persistence (Table II.2). A decomposition of CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, components points to contrasting movements. 20.7 per cent in CPI) has been undergoing consecutive increases from August 2020, reaching 6.5 per cent in August 2021. This was driven primarily by clothing and footwear, health care \u2013 particularly medicines \u2013 household goods like utensils, washing soap/ powder, furniture, personal care items and toiletries (Chart II.16a). On the other hand, services inflation (with a weight of 23.0 per cent in CPI) which was at 4.3 per cent in February, firmed up moderately to 4.5 Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. per cent in August 2021. The contribution of services, on an average, to core inflation was somewhat lower than what was seen in the pre-pandemic period (Chart II.14). A recovery in housing rentals along with rising education services inflation from the post- lockdown historic lows are the key drivers for the uptick in core services inflation between February and August 2021, apart from medical as well as household services (Chart II.16b). 5% trimmed 10% trimmed 25% trimmed In order to filter noise from CPI inflation and get to the underlying inflation dynamics two common approaches are (i) excluding a fixed set of components from the CPI basket that display volatile price movements and are likely to be transitory; and (ii) excluding different components each month if they are located in the tails of the inflation distribution. The exclusion-based measures show heightened inflationary pressures over the last six months with no decisive signs of softening (Table II.2). Inflation measured by trimmed means, on the other hand, shows some edging down of the underlying inflation pressures in August from the June-July peak (Table II.3). adverse base effects. WPI inflation moderated in owing to base effects turning favourable, although it remained in double digits. In August, WPI inflation reversed course and edged up to 11.4 per cent Over the last 14 months, inflation in sectoral CPIs for agricultural labourers (CPI-AL) and rural labourers (CPI-RL) has remained below CPI headline inflation. Lower food inflation, paired with their higher weights in CPI-AL and CPI-RL contributed to the lower CPI- AL and CPI-RL inflation prints. Inflation in terms of the CPI for industrial workers (CPI-IW) fell below the headline during May-August 2021. manufactured products inflation, despite softening of food inflation. In line with WPI inflation, the deflators for gross value added (GVA) and gross domestic product (GDP) edged up sharply between WPI inflation has averaged 11.7 per cent during April- August 2021, remaining markedly above CPI inflation WPI inflation registered sharp increases sequentially between February and May 2021 to touch an all- time high of 13.1 per cent (as per the WPI series, petroleum products \u2013 especially petrol and diesel \u2013 eggs and edible oils diverged considerably between the CPI and the WPI (Chart II.17b). These developments have again brought to fore the possibility of transmission of Since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, consumer price and wholesale price in\ufb02ation rates have been exhibiting considerable divergence, the wedge widening to 6.1 percentage points in August 2021 (Chart II.2.1). This brought to fore the concern \u2013 will elevated WPI in\ufb02ation feed into CPI? Recent studies have shown that over time and through the course of the pandemic the sensitivity of CPI in\ufb02ation to WPI in\ufb02ation has come down (RBI, 2021). An analysis based on CPI and WPI for the period, April 2012-July 2021, shows that a long-run relationship exists between CPI and WPI14. The speed of adjustment is low. The CPI food index and the WPI food index are cointegrated as well as homogeneous, i.e., they move one-on-one in the long term. CPI core and WPI core are also found to be cointegrated but the long run coef\ufb01cient is less than one. While WPI core largely comprises of basic and intermediate (Contd.) 14 The long-run relationship between headline CPI and WPI in\ufb02ation has been disrupted by the pandemic and it holds only after controlling for the pandemic related disruptions.

WPI and CPI fuel groups, on the other hand, are not cointegrated (Table II.2.1). During H1:2021, costs, as measured by in\ufb02ation in WPI industrial raw materials and farm inputs, increased (Chart II.18). The \ufb01rming up of global crude oil prices during 2021 impacted the prices of inputs such as high-speed diesel (HSD), naphtha, aviation turbine fuel (ATF), and furnace oil. Prices of non-food articles also increased during March- August 2021. Prices of \ufb01bres and oilseeds edged up as international cotton and soybean prices increased. However, in\ufb02ation in industrial raw materials eased marginally in July 2021 re\ufb02ecting easing in prices of minerals, bitumen, paper and pulp, before picking up again in August 2021. The increase in farm input price in\ufb02ation was largely driven by double digit in\ufb02ation in fodder, due to damage to production from excess rains during September-October 2020, and HSD re\ufb02ecting \ufb01rming up of global crude oil prices. Fertiliser prices, on a year-on-year basis, edged up moderately during 2021, re\ufb02ecting increase in international prices. Prices of electricity \u2013 a key input in both industrial and farm inputs \u2013 remained muted during H1:2021. Price increase of agricultural machinery and implements, on a year-on-year basis, also stayed subdued, although a gradual pass-through of higher manufacturing costs due to rising commodity prices is underway during March-August 2021. rates of the nominal rural wages eased sharply, on a year-on-year basis, during May-July 2021, attributable to adverse base effects15 (Chart II.19). Growth in the value of production in the organised sector decelerated in contrast to the increase in staff costs for listed \ufb01rms in the manufacturing sector during Q1:2021-22. In the services sector, staff cost increased sharper than the value of production. As a result, unit labour costs (measured as a ratio of staff cost to value of production) rose from 5.7 per cent in Q4:2020-21 to 6.2 per cent in Q1:2021-22 for \ufb01rms in the manufacturing sector16 and from 29.1 per cent to 31.5 per cent for \ufb01rms in the services sector17 (Chart II.20). Nominal rural wages for both agricultural and non- agricultural labourers remained stagnant; growth Input cost pressures and salary outgoes are expected to rise in Q3:2021-22 for the manufacturing \ufb01rms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey. Manufacturers may pass on the cost burden 15 Rural wages had increased sharply during May-June 2020 re\ufb02ecting labour shortages during the nationwide lockdown period and the hike in wages by `20 under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREGA) scheme effective April 1, 2020. 16 Based on 1,647 manufacturing \ufb01rms. 17 Based on 661 services \ufb01rms. going forward.

The latest survey pertains to July 2021. With in near months, the outlook has improved, and its trajectory in\ufb02ation expected to moderate may be shifting downwards in contrast to initial in pulses and edible oils, should bring about a pressures showing no sign of abating, core in\ufb02ation remains sticky and elevated. Furthermore, shortage of key industrial components due to stretched global supply chains and logistics is also leading to cost is a rising risk of higher input price pass-through to output prices. Measures to ameliorate supply-side cost pressures would be critical at this juncture, indirect taxes on petrol and diesel. This would help a wage-price nexus and provide space for monetary policy to sustain support for the still incomplete While the second wave dented the momentum of economic activity in Q1:2021-22, its impact on aggregate demand was muted relative to the first wave. Aggregate demand recovered in Q2:2021-22 and is expected to strengthen further in H2. The supply side is gradually normalising with the easing of supply chain and logistic disruptions. The recovery, however, remains dependent upon continued policy support, the COVID-19 trajectory and the progress of vaccination. Within days of the release of April 2021 MPR, the second wave of COVID-19 intensified and became virulent and lethal, overwhelming the health infrastructure and denting the momentum of economic activity in Q1:2021-22. The second wave receded as rapidly as it had surged (Chart III.1). Accordingly, the impact on aggregate demand was muted and short-lived relative to the \ufb01rst wave. More nuanced and calibrated containment measures and adaptation by businesses and households to working in a pandemic environment also moderated the headwinds from the second wave. Aggregate demand recovered further in Q2:2021- 22, led by investment and private consumption. a: New Cases (7-day moving average) b: Fatalities and Recovery Rate (7-day moving average) c: Daily Vaccinations (7-day moving average) Weighted contribution* Note: *: Component-wise contributions to growth do not add up to GDP growth because change in stocks, valuables and discrepancies are not included. Figures in parentheses are growth rates over Q1:2019-20. FRE: First revised estimates, PE: Provisional estimate Source: National Statistical Of\ufb01ce (NSO). The recovery is bene\ufb01tting from pent-up demand supported by the increasing vaccination coverage, the government\u2019s push towards capital expenditure, robust external demand and normal monsoon. The ongoing demand revival is expected to get a further boost from the government\u2019s asset monetisation programme and reforms encompassing the telecom and banking sectors. The supply side is also gradually normalising with the easing of supply chain and logistic disruptions. Agriculture and allied activities remain resilient, backed by above normal kharif sowing. A number of high-frequency indicators are yet to exceed the pre-COVID levels, however, and the recovery remains dependent upon continued policy support. Despite a loss of momentum in the wake of the severe second wave, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 20.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q1:2021-22 on a large favourable base effect (Table III.1 and Chart III.2a), supported by expansion Note: SAAR \u2013 Seasonally adjusted annualised rate. Sources: NSO and RBI staff estimates. in all its constituents except for government \ufb01nal consumption expenditure (GFCE) which contracted. The level of GDP in Q1:2021-22 was, however, still 9.2 per cent below the pre-pandemic (Q1:2019-20) level. Excluding GFCE, real GDP expanded by 25.0 per cent (y-o-y) during Q1. Momentum \u2013 the quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of real GDP \u2013 fell during Q1:2021-22, however, re\ufb02ecting the lockdowns/restrictions during the second wave, although the contraction was lower than a year ago with businesses and households adapting better to COVID-19 protocols as well as the sharp tapering in infections (Chart III.2b). Aggregate demand gained momentum in Q2, supported by recovery in private consumption and investment demand. Actual real GDP growth of 20.1 per cent in Q1 undershot the April 2021 MPR projection of 26.2 per cent (Chart III.3), largely re\ufb02ecting the impact of the steep jump in infections due to the second wave. The April MPR had alluded to the potential surge in infections and new mutants as downside risks to the baseline growth path. The decline in the government consumption expenditure also contributed to actual GDP growth trailing projections. Private consumption, with a share of around 55 per cent in GDP during Q1:2021-22, continued as the mainstay of aggregate demand. Notwithstanding a y-o-y growth of 19.3 per cent, it was around 12 per cent lower than its pre-COVID level (Q1:2019-20). The accelerated pace of vaccination and the plateauing of new infections are facilitating faster resumption of contact-intensive services and giving a \ufb01llip to private consumption. Urban demand is turning the corner as corroborated by high frequency coincident and leading indicators for Q2. Passenger vehicle sales in July and August crossed pre-COVID levels (Chart III.4a), but production is facing headwinds from the persistence of global supply bottlenecks in the availability of semiconductor chips. Domestic air passenger traf\ufb01c and the production of consumer durables regained traction during July and August, albeit they are still below pre-COVID levels (Chart III.4b and c). Household credit is gradually improving, driven by credit card transactions and personal consumer durables \ufb01nancing (Chart III.4d). Digital retail payments data, which provide useful signals of economic activity, corroborate the upturn (Box III.1). supporting Rural consumption demand, which was largely immune to the pandemic during the \ufb01rst wave, was dented during the second wave with the fast spread of infections to rural areas. With the abatement of the second wave and improving vaccinations, rural consumption exhibited recovery in Q2, backed by buoyant rabi harvest, good kharif prospects, government transfers and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) programme. The pick-up in motorcycle sales during June-August and the improvement in consumer non-durables underscore this revival (Chart III.5). Tractor sales have exhibited robust growth, remaining above their pre-pandemic levels, although sales dipped 2019 levels, although trailing the exceptionally strong growth of last year. sales picked up from May, moving in tandem with Unemployment rose and labour force participation fell in Q1:2021-22 under the pressure of the second A robust assessment of the current state of the economy and its expected trajectory is critical for the effectiveness of a forward-looking monetary policy. Data on GDP \u2013 the comprehensive measure of economic activity \u2013 are however, available, with a lag of two months after the end of the reference quarter. Given these data lags and the large and swift exogenous shocks that have been witnessed in the recent years (such as the 2008 global \ufb01nancial crisis and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the interest in new macroeconomic forecasting tools to nowcast economic activity has become widespread. In this regard, payments data represent a unique source of tracing the underlying economic activity, given their crucial role in undertaking and settling transactions in a market economy. Cross- country empirical evidence suggests that the payments data enhance the accuracy of the nowcasts and short-term forecasts relative to other indicators (Aprigliano et. al., 2019; Bentsen et. al., 2021). India has state-of-the-art payments infrastructure and products and there is a wider adoption of digital payments (Das, 2021). The share of digital transactions in the total volume of non-cash retail payments stood at 98.5 per cent during 2020-21. The width and the depth of the banking system, the enhanced policy focus on promoting digital payments and the relatively quick availability of such data make them valuable for nowcasting GDP in the Indian context. A preliminary analysis shows that, amongst the various modes of digital retail payments, the volume of transactions through the following three channels \u2013 ATMs, credit cards and debit cards \u2013 has a high correlation with GDP (0.95 for the period Q1:2011- 12 to Q4:2020-21). The dynamics are further explored through alternate autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model speci\ufb01cations with the following variables: real GDP, digital payments volumes (as de\ufb01ned above), and select real economy indicators having a strong association with output (namely, petroleum consumption, electricity consumption and railway freight traf\ufb01c) as control variables1. To assess the role of the payments data relative to the competing variables, three model speci\ufb01cations are attempted. Model 1 includes data only on digital payments; Model 2 augments payments data with the control variables; Model 3 drops the payments data and includes only the three control variables. Given the large disruptions to the economic activity from the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the relative forecasting performance, the models are estimated initially for the pre-COVID period (Q2:2011-12 to Q3:2019- 20) and subsequently for the sample including the COVID period (Q2:2011-12 to Q4:2020-21). The estimates indicate that the forecasts of the baseline model with payments Notes: Model 1: digital payments only; Model 2: digital payments plus petroleum consumption, electricity consumption and railway freight traf\ufb01c; Model 3: Petroleum consumption, electricity consumption and railway freight traf\ufb01c; AR(1): Autoregressive model (\ufb01rst-order). Source: RBI staff estimates. data (Model 1) outperform the speci\ufb01cation which does not include payments data (Model 3) and also upon the benchmark AR(1) model (Chart III.1.1). Payments data thus add value to the forecasting toolkit and mixed frequency modelling approaches can provide monthly updates of the evolving output dynamics. The fast pace of the innovations in the payments technology and the rapid shifts in the payments habits of economic agents need ongoing re\ufb01nements in the modelling approaches.

According to the Centre for Monitoring also shown strong recovery recently, according to Naukri Jobspeak data. Indian Economy (CMIE), there was a deep hit to wave. Employment recovered swiftly in June-July and strengthened in September (Chart III.6a). In September, labour participation further rose with the phased opening up of the economy leading to rising demand for labour. Employment conditions improved in June and July 2021 in the organised sector, according to payrolls data (Chart III.6b). Increase in hirings is led by the IT sector, while Gross \ufb01xed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by 55.3 per cent (y-o-y) in Q1 (contraction of 46.6 per cent a year ago). Sequentially, there was a dip of 23.6 per cent in Q1 despite robust government capex. The share of GFCF in aggregate demand inched up to 31.6 per cent in Q1 from 24.4 per cent a year ago but remained lower than its pre-pandemic level. Construction activity, a large portion of GFCF, was subdued due to pandemic effects, especially led by labour and materials shortages, although the impact was less than during the \ufb01rst wave. There are signs of insurance, hospitality and automobile sector have revival in investment demand in Q2, as suggested by the movements in the proximate indictors \u2013 capital Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector dropped to 60.0 per cent in Q1:2021-22 from 69.4 per cent in the previous quarter (Chart III.8). On a seasonally adjusted basis, CU fell from 66.7 per cent in Q4 to 61.7 per cent in Q1. The interest coverage ratio (ICR)2 of listed non- \ufb01nancial private companies in the manufacturing and information technology (IT) sectors improved further in Q1:2021-22, indicating improved debt servicing capacity and hence, conducive conditions for the expansion in investment activity (Chart III.9). The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme is nurturing private investment. The mega schemes, viz. National Infrastructure Plan (NIP) amounting to `100 lakh crore and National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) involving `6 lakh crore (Chart III.10), are also expected to give a major thrust to infrastructure spending and uplift potential output. The NMP, which will be co-terminus with the balance NIP period (2021-22 to 2024-2025), is expected to unlock the value of investments in brown\ufb01eld public sector assets by tapping institutional and long-term capital Note: Data for Q1:2021-22 are based on results of 1,647 listed private manufacturing companies and 661 listed private non-\ufb01nacial services companies.

Though Government \ufb01nal consumption expenditure (GFCE) contracted by 4.8 per cent in Q1:2021-22, partly due to the base effect. Revenues \u2013 both tax and non-tax \u2013 remained robust. The \ufb01scal position of the central government accordingly strengthened during April- August 2021 and the gross \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit (GFD) and the revenue de\ufb01cit (RD) at 31.1 per cent and 27.3 per cent of the budget estimate (BE), respectively, 2021-22 presented in July involved gross additional expenditure of `1,87,202 crore, the net cash outgo amounts to only `23,675 crore or 0.12 per cent of GDP. The buoyancy in the central government\u2019s tax revenue during April-August 2021 was driven higher import demand and improving trade activity) (Table III.3). Excise duty collections bene\ufb01tted from Per cent to BE higher global crude oil prices. Goods and services tax (GST) collections received a jolt from the second wave during May and June but recovered rapidly in the subsequent period (Chart III.11). Overall, direct taxes rose by 101.4 per cent y-o-y (32.8 per cent over the corresponding period of 2019-20), while indirect taxes surged by 52.5 per cent (27.2 per cent over the corresponding period of 2019-20). Non-tax revenue also registered healthy growth, boosted by higher surplus transfer by the Reserve Bank. On the expenditure side, revenue expenditure contracted marginally by 0.8 per cent y-o-y during April-August 2021 (although higher by 6.3 per cent over the pre-pandemic level), partly due to the frontloading of expenditures a year ago necessitated by the \ufb01rst wave of the pandemic and also efforts to curtail avoidable spending. Spending on major subsidies, however, increased by 12.8 per cent y-o-y (lower by 22.2 per cent compared to the same period of 2019-20), with the extension of the schemes put in place last year to provide free ration to more than 80 crore people under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. The central government\u2019s capital expenditure increased by 27.8 per cent y-o-y during April-August 2021 (and 26.2 per cent over pre-COVID level), driven by outlays towards road transport and highways. Available information for 18 states indicates that their GFD in April-July 2021 (as per cent to full year budget estimates) was lower than a year ago on the back of a surge in revenue receipts led by own tax and non-tax revenues, even as transfers from the Centre contracted (Chart III.12).3 Subsequent to the 43rd meeting of the GST Council, it was decided that the Centre would borrow `1.59 lakh crore from the market through a special window for 2021-22, which would be passed on to states as back to back loans; of this, an amount of `75,000 crore has been transferred to states. Furthermore, `81,179 crore of the GST compensation overdues of the last year are also expected to be transferred this year. Both revenue and capital expenditure of the states picked up during 3 Following the deterioration in key \ufb01scal indicators in 2020-21, 27 states budgeted a lower consolidated GFD at 3.4 per cent of GDP for 2021-22, driven by higher revenues. April-July 2021 \u2013 the latter expanded sharply by 99 per cent, more than offsetting the contraction of 45 per cent a year ago. The Union Budget 2021-22 projected gross and net market borrowings at `12.05 lakh crore and `9.24 lakh crore, respectively. The centre\u2019s gross issuances of market borrowings during the \ufb01rst half were `7.02 lakh crore (58.3 per cent of the full year budgeted amount) as against `7.24 lakh crore envisaged in the calendar for H1 (Table III.4). The weighted average cost and maturity of issuances during H1:2021-22 were 6.19 per cent and 16.7 years, respectively (5.8 per cent and 14.8 years in the same period of 2020-21). For H2:2021-22, the centre\u2019s gross market borrowings have been planned `5.03 lakh crore in line with the full year budget estimates. Against the backdrop of comfortable cash position, the Central Government has not planned additional market borrowing for making payment to the state governments for GST compensation. States raised gross market borrowings of `3.09 lakh crore during H1:2021-22, 83.4 per cent of the indicative calendar. Buoyed by strong external demand and base effects, exports registered a sharp expansion in Q1:2021- 22 and the buoyancy continued to Q2 (Chart III.13). Merchandise imports also rebounded strongly on the back of the recovery in domestic demand, higher crude oil prices and base effects. With the growth of imports outpacing that of exports, net exports contributed negatively to aggregate demand in Q1:2021-22 [(-)1.9 per cent in Q1 as compared with 1.3 per cent a year ago and (-) 4.8 per cent two years ago (pre-COVID)]. The surge in merchandise exports was powered by engineering goods, petroleum products, organic and inorganic chemicals, cotton textiles and drugs and pharmaceuticals. Labour-intensive sectors like The ways and means advances (WMA) limit for the Central Government for H1:2021-22 was scaled back to `1.2 lakh crore from `2 lakh crore in H1:2020-21; for H2:2021-22, it has been \ufb01xed at `0.5 lakh core as compared with `1.25 lakh core a year ago. For states/union territories, the Reserve Bank decided to continue with the enhanced interim WMA limit of `51,560 crore during the \ufb01rst half of 2021-22 to help them in tiding over the short-term mismatches and dif\ufb01culties faced due to the pandemic. apparels, leather products and tea continue to lag, mainly due to their greater sensitivity to mobility restrictions (Chart III.14). Going forward, the schemes such as District as Export Hub (DEH) covering One District One Product (ODOP), PLI scheme for sunrise sectors and Ubharte-Sitaare scheme for MSMEs should improve export competitiveness and help to achieve the target of US$ 400 billion set for 2021-22. The persistent upsurge in global container freight prices and the growing shortage of semi-conductors, however, pose downside risks to a durable merchandise trade recovery (see Chapter V). The impact of the second wave on import demand remained limited as compared to the \ufb01rst wave, re\ufb02ecting calibrated and localised restrictions and businesses adapting to COVID-appropriate working environment. In Q2, with the gradual unwinding of restrictions, merchandise imports spurted and exceeded pre-COVID levels. Non-oil non-gold imports were led by higher shipments of pearls and precious stones, vegetable oils, chemicals and chemical products. Gold imports, after dropping sharply in May and June on the back of subdued demand due to the second wave, revived in Q2 with the relaxations of the restrictions (Chart III.15). The trade de\ufb01cit widened to US$ 55.5 billion in April-August 2021 from US$ 23.4 billion a year ago, but it remained below its pre- COVID level (US$ 77.2 billion). Services exports growth in Q1: 2021-22 was the highest in 13 quarters and surpassed pre-pandemic levels (Chart III.16). This strong growth in the overall services exports was driven by software, business, and information technology (IT) companies continued to bene\ufb01t from pandemic-induced demand from international customers and adoption of new models. They recorded solid revenue growth in Q1:2021-22, driven by banking, \ufb01nancial services including insurance, communications, healthcare and technology services. As a result, resilient services surplus had a favourable impact on the current account balance in Q1:2021-22. During Q2 (July-August 2021), double-digit growth in services exports was driven by software, business and transport services. Turning to the \ufb01nancial account, capital \ufb02ows remained healthy during Q1:2021-22, primarily due to foreign direct investment (FDI), which was driven by a few big deals in the manufacturing and digital sectors (Chart III.17). Net FDI at US$ 14.1 billion in April-July 2021 was higher than a year ago. While foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) adopted a cautious stance during the second wave of COVID-19, they turned net buyers from August 2021 amidst robust Q1 corporate earnings and better domestic macroeconomic to non- resident deposits moderated during April-July 2021 as compared with a year ago. As on October 1, 2021, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 637.5 billion, equivalent to 14 months of imports projected for 2021-22 and 111.6 per cent of outstanding external debt at end-June 2021.

Real gross value added (GVA) at basic prices rose by 18.8 per cent y-o-y during Q1:2021-22 as against a contraction of 22.4 per cent in Q1:2020-21 (Table III.5). The resilience of agriculture and the recovery in manufacturing intensive services supported the expansion in GVA, while contact-intensive services lagged due to logistic and operational constraints. Real GVA was, however, 7.8 per cent below its pre-pandemic (Q1:2019-20) level. Agriculture and allied activities registered robust growth in Q1:2021-22 on the back of record rabi and horticulture production and resilience in allied activities. Foodgrains production rose by 3.7 per cent in 2020-21, led by rice and wheat (Table III.6). The production of nine major oilseeds increased by 8.7 per cent, supported by the implementation of area expansion policies under the National Food Security Mission for edible oils. Horticulture production rose by 2.9 per cent during 2020-21, led by an increase of 2.8 per cent in the area under cultivation. In 2021, the south-west monsoon rainfall encountered two slowdown phases (from the third week of June to mid-July and almost the whole of August), after a normal start. With the strong revival of rains in September, the cumulative seasonal rainfall was 0.7 per cent below the long period average (LPA), with 83 per cent of the sub-divisions receiving normal or above normal rainfall (Charts III.18a and b). The production weighted rainfall (PRN) index at 102 per cent (as on September 30) was below last year\u2019s position (105 per cent) and the PRN for rice, coarse cereals and sugarcane exceeded the 5-year average. As on September 30, 2021, reservoir levels stood at 80 per cent of the full reservoir level (FRL), higher than the decadal average of 77 per cent \u2013 brightening the prospects for the ensuing rabi season (Chart III.18 c). Despite the breaks in the monsoon\u2019s progress, kharif sowing progressed well. As on September 30, 2021 it was 0.2 per cent above the record sowing acreage a year ago, and 4.1 per cent higher than the normal sown area (5-year average) (Chart III.18d). Higher minimum support prices (MSPs) \u2013 with increases of 1.1 per cent to 6.6 per cent over the previous year for kharif 2021-22 with assured return of at least 50 per cent over the cost of production (as measured by A2 plus FL) \u2013 supported sowing activity. According to the \ufb01rst advance estimates for 2021-22, the production of kharif foodgrains rose by 0.6 per cent over last year (Table III.7). The Government of India had set the target for foodgrains production for the year at 3,070 lakh tonnes in the National Kharif Strategy for 2021- 22 which, inter alia, aims to attain self-suf\ufb01ciency in the production of pulses and oilseeds. #: Lakh bales of 170 kgs each. # #: Lakh bales of 180 kgs each.

Industrial GVA posted y-o-y growth of 40.4 per cent in Q1:2021-22, aided by a favourable base effect (31.0 per cent contraction last year). On a sequential basis, industrial output contracted by 11.8 per cent in Q1, re\ufb02ecting the loss of momentum in the face of the second wave. Industrial GVA trailed 3.1 per cent below its pre-pandemic level (Q1:2019-20); while mining and manufacturing remained below Q1:2019- 20 levels, electricity, gas, water supply and other services exceeded Q1:2019-20 levels by 3.0 per cent (Chart III.19). The index of industrial production (IIP) rose by 44.7 per cent y-o-y during Q1:2021-22 on a negative base but remained 6.7 per cent below its level two years back. In Q2, the IIP expanded by 11.5 per cent y-o-y in July 2021, although it trailed marginally the pre-pandemic levels (July 2019). Sequentially, the IIP expanded in June-July after moderating in April and May. In terms of the use-based classi\ufb01cation, all sectors except for consumer durables exceeded 2019-20 levels by July (Chart III.20). Manufacturing activity dipped in May but gained momentum in June-July. The production of motor vehicles, trailers, machinery equipment, electrical equipment, textiles and beverages supported IIP growth in July. Manufacturing activity is expected to be boosted by the PLI scheme for 13 sectors, aimed at creating global manufacturing champions for an AtmaNirbhar Bharat, with an outlay of about Rs. 1.97 lakh crore over 5 years. The PLI scheme, implemented across ten sectors so far (Chart III.21), can improve the manufacturing sector\u2019s global competitiveness and participation in the global supply chain, giving impetus to domestic production, exports, investment in cutting edge technology, innovations and employment opportunities by establishing linkages with the MSME sector. Electricity generation in Q1:2021-22 on a y-o-y basis but remained below 2019- 20 levels. Thermal and renewable sources expanded y-o-y by 24.1 per cent and 12.9 per cent, respectively, with the latter surpassing 2019-20 levels. In Q2, the electricity generation expanded by 1.6 per cent and 15.8 per cent, respectively, in July and August, with hydro and thermal power generation also exceeding III.22a). Electricity (Chart pre-pandemic consumption rose across the country in July and August, with base effects leading to faster growth in some regions (Chart III.22b).

For Q3:2021-22, respondents expect further improvement in production volumes, new orders and job landscape. The manufacturing The buoyant y-o-y expansion in nominal GVA of manufacturing in Q1 was supported by strong corporate pro\ufb01tability (Chart III.23). Apart from the base effect, the substantial contraction in interest expenses on the back of easy \ufb01nancial conditions contributed to the surge in pro\ufb01tability, even as employee costs and operating expenses posted an uptick.

The second wave impacted the services sector in a disproportionately high manner in view of the blow to contact-intensive services. Services contracted by double digits sequentially in Q1:2021-22, interrupting the recovery from the \ufb01rst wave. On a y-o-y basis, however, the services sector expanded by 16.1 per cent in Q1:2021-22 driven by a favourable base effect. With the retreating of the second wave, services regained momentum in Q2 as shown by high frequency indicators, and contact-intensive services began mending with the gradual easing of restrictions and the accelerated pace of vaccination (Table III.9). GST collections and issuances of e-way bills \u2013 indicators of wholesale and retail trade \u2013 revived to pre- pandemic levels from June/July onwards, suggesting strengthening domestic trading activity. Some revival in discretionary spending and pent-up demand are also boosting trading activity and e-commerce. In the construction sector, cement production rose further while \ufb01nished steel consumption moderated in August (Chart III.25). Transportation services remained relatively upbeat during Q1 and gained further in Q2 with the gradual unwinding of the regional lockdowns. Railway freight traf\ufb01c remains above pre-COVID levels and posted a robust growth of 16.9 per cent in August, while port cargo traf\ufb01c reached its pre-pandemic level in August. Toll collections in Q1 and Q2 have stayed above the pre-pandemic levels due to a greater use of FASTag (Table III.9). Commercial vehicle sales \u2013 an indicator of transportation services \u2013 almost halved sequentially in Q1, but there are reports of an uptick in sales in Q2. The aviation sector displayed segmentation, with passenger traf\ufb01c lagging cargo traf\ufb01c considerably. Domestic air passenger traf\ufb01c is, however, gaining traction with the lifting of the restrictions and increasing con\ufb01dence. The communication services performed well in Q1 and Q2, driven by pandemic- induced digitisation of the economy. Despite the strong performance of information technology and \ufb01nancial companies, GVA in \ufb01nancial, real estate and professional services posted a subdued growth of 3.7 per cent in Q1 and moderated substantially over the preceding quarter as businesses PMI: Services (>50 indicates growth over previous month) Steel consumption Cement production II Trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting Commercial vehicle sales (Quarterly average) Domestic air passenger traf\ufb01c Domestic air cargo Freight traf\ufb01c Port cargo Toll collection: volume Petroleum consumption GST E-way bill GST revenue III Financial, real estate and professional services Credit outstanding y-o-y growth (per cent) Bank deposits y-o-y growth (per cent) Life insurance: \ufb01rst year premium Non-life insurance premium in other segments faltered due to mobility related restrictions. Some recovery, however, was seen in the travel and hospitality industries, real estate and other contact-intensive professional services in Q2. Growth in aggregate deposits remained buoyant and bank credit recorded some improvement, extending support to \ufb01nancial services during Q2. Real estate activity dampened in Q1 as new launches and sales were hampered by the lockdowns. The inventory overhang stagnated at an average of 58 months in Q1 (Chart III.26a). All-India housing prices, according to the RBI\u2019s index, showed a deceleration in Q1:2021- 22, dragged down by Bengaluru, Chennai and Delhi (Chart III.26b). Public administration, defence and other services (PADO) expanded moderately in Q1:2021-22 on a y-o-y basis. The central government\u2019s revenue expenditure, excluding interest payments and subsidies, contracted in Q1 on an unfavourable base while that of state governments posted a double-digit growth. Other services in PADO \u2013 private education; heath; personal services; and cultural and recreational activities \u2013 remained tepid. In August and September, the PMI services re-entered the expansion zone reversing the second wave induced contraction of May-July (Chart III.24b). The PMI composite output index rose to 55.3 in September from 49.2 in July. minimum support prices for the ensuing rabi season. The momentum of economic activity was interrupted during Q1:2021-22 by the second wave. Aggregate demand began reviving in June and gained momentum in Q2. It is expected to strengthen further in H2 with the recovery in both urban and rural consumption. On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities should bene\ufb01t from the good kharif sowing and harvest. Rabi sowing and total crops production are expected to be well-supported by improving water storage in reservoirs and the early announcement of including contact-intensive services, in H2 should get a \ufb01llip from the growing proportion of the inoculated congenial \ufb01nancing conditions and the government\u2019s outlook, however, remains critically dependent upon of vaccination to cover the rest of the population. During H1:2021-22, domestic financial markets remained vibrant amidst easy liquidity conditions, notwithstanding the ravages unleashed by the virulent second wave of the pandemic in April-May 2021. Monetary transmission improved further, due to abundant liquidity and forward guidance by the MPC of continuing with the accommodative stance. Going forward, liquidity conditions would continue to be accommodative in consonance with the monetary policy stance through calibrated liquidity management operations. Global \ufb01nancial markets remained exuberant through most of H1:2021-22, buoyed by a surfeit of liquidity, ultra-accommodative monetary policies in major advanced economies (AEs) and forward guidance promising continuation of these policies. Investor optimism has caused valuations across a range of assets to be elevated. Stock markets scaled peaks repeatedly in most AEs and select emerging market economies (EMEs), with intermittent bouts of corrections sparked by the rapid spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19. Bond yields softened in AEs as markets increasingly acquiesced with central banks that in\ufb02ationary pressures are transient and would not trigger normalisation. In EMEs, bond yields experienced two-way movements, with phases of hardening in response to the uncertainty over the timing and pace of tapering of asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve. In currency markets, the US dollar strengthened from May 2021 on better economic prospects and consequently, some EME currencies depreciated while others faced appreciation pressures because of carry trade and search for returns. \ufb01nancial markets. Concerns about a possible third wave, uncertainty over the path of the US Fed\u2019s tapering of asset purchases, elevated in\ufb02ation, and the large government borrowing programme kept market sentiments edgy. Money market rates consistently traded below the reverse repo rate \u2013 the lower bound of the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor \u2013 during H1:2021- 22 (Chart IV.1). The weighted average call rate (WACR) \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 traded 17 basis points (bps) below the \ufb02oor of the corridor on an average during H1. With the Reserve Bank becoming the major counterparty for banks, there was During H1:2021-22, domestic \ufb01nancial markets remained vibrant amidst easy liquidity conditions, notwithstanding the ravages unleashed by the virulent second wave of the pandemic in April-May 2021. Large liquidity injections, including through the secondary market acquisition programme of government securities (G-SAP), ensured orderly conditions in a shrinkage in inter-bank trading activity \u2013 average daily volume in the call money market declined to `7,381 crore in September 2021 from `10,126 crore in March 2021. In the overnight call money segment, the weighted average rate (WAR) of traded deals generally remained above the reverse repo rate while that on reported deals1 remained below the reverse repo rate, re\ufb02ecting market segmentation as small co-operative banks \u2013 principal lenders in reported deals \u2013 do not have the requisite information technology (IT) infrastructure to access the Negotiated Dealing System - Call (NDS- Call) and usually lend bilaterally towards the close of market hours at lower rates. The share of the reported deals in total volumes in the call money segment increased to 60 per cent in H1:2021-22 from 54 per cent in H2:2020-21 (Chart IV.2), driven by a rise in lending by co-operative banks from 65 per cent of the total volume of the call money segment to 80 per cent over the same period. The surplus liquidity conditions also led to a diminishing share of the uncollateralised segment in \u2018Traded deals\u2019 are negotiated directly on the NDS-Call platform whereas \u2018reported deals\u2019 are over-the-counter (OTC) deals which are reported on the NDS-Call platform after the completion of negotiation of deals. total overnight money market volume \u2013 from 6.0 per cent in February 2020 (pre-pandemic) to 2.0 per cent in September 2021. In the collateralised segment, the share of triparty repo in total overnight money market volume increased to 74 per cent in September 2021 from 72 per cent in March 2021 while the share of market repo declined to 24 per cent from 26 per cent during the same period (Chart IV.3). Mutual funds, the major lenders in both the collateralised segments, increased their participation further in H1 from 68 per cent to 70 per cent in the triparty repo segment and from 61 per cent to 63 per cent in market repos. On the borrowing side, there was an increase in the share of private banks in both the secured segments \u2013 from 24 per cent in March 2021 to 25 per cent in September 2021 for triparty repo and from 13 per cent to 14 per cent for market repo. The rates in the secured overnight segments remained consistently below the reverse repo rate during H1:2021-22 on surplus liquidity (Chart IV.4). Interest rates on longer-term money market instruments like 91-day Treasury Bills (T-bills) and 3-month certi\ufb01cates of deposit (CDs) traded marginally above the reverse repo rate, on average, by 1 bp and 8 bps, respectively crore during the corresponding period of 2020-21 (Chart IV.5a). CP rates generally traded above the reverse repo rate, with an average spread of 46 bps during H1:2021-22. The weighted average discount rate (WADR) \ufb01rmed up in July 2021 due to increased issuances by non-banking \ufb01nancial companies (NBFCs), partly to mobilise resources for investment in initial public offerings (IPOs), but moderated subsequently. The share of NBFCs in total CP issuances increased to 43.2 per cent in H1: 2021-22 from 21.9 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year while that of corporates moderated to 46.2 per cent from 64.9 per cent over the same period (Chart IV.5b). during H1:2021-22. Issuance of CDs increased to `56,658 crore during H1:2021-22 from `45,165 crore in the corresponding period of 2020-21, re\ufb02ecting congenial \ufb01nancing conditions. Riding on the surplus liquidity conditions, commercial increased substantially to paper (CP) `10.1 lakh crore during H1:2021-22 from `7.9 lakh During H1:2021-22, the 10-year G-sec yield softened by 11 bps, aided by a host of measures taken by the Reserve Bank to foster an orderly evolution of the yield curve. During April-May 2021, the 10-year G-sec yield softened by 6 bps on (i) the monetary policy committee (MPC) continuing with its accommodative growth-supportive stances; (ii) the announcement of G-SAP 1.0 of `1 lakh crore for Q1; and (iii) special OMOs (operation twist) of `10,000 crore, although fears of additional government borrowing to bridge the GST compensation cess shortfall imparted transient bearishness to market sentiment. Yields hardened in June by 8 bps over elevated May in\ufb02ation print and higher crude oil prices. Overall, however, the 10-year yield remained range bound during Q1:2021-22. The dynamics of movements in the yield curve can be captured by its level and slope2 (Chart IV.7a). While the average level of yields softened by 3 bps, the slope steepened by 28 bps during H1. Short term yields remained anchored around the policy rate while long term yields re\ufb02ected in\ufb02ation concerns and the size of the government borrowing programme (Chart IV.7b). In Q2, the 10-year yield initially declined to 6.13 per cent on July 15, 2021 aided by a lower than expected CPI in\ufb02ation print for June and issuance of a new 10-year benchmark security at a coupon of 6.10 per cent (Chart IV.6). In August, however, yields hardened by 5 bps in reaction to the MPC\u2019s in\ufb02ation forecast being revised upwards above expectations and fears of liquidity tightening on the announcement of a calendar for an enhanced scale of variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions. In the \ufb01rst half of September, yields softened as these apprehensions were allayed, along with (i) the resumption of portfolio debt in\ufb02ows; (ii), lower than expected \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit of the central government for April-July; and (iii) a softer CPI in\ufb02ation print. Yields, however, \ufb01rmed up during the second half of the month tracking US treasury yields and hardening crude oil prices. At the shorter end of the secondary market, yields on treasury bills (T-bills) softened and traded below the reverse repo rate for some maturities (Chart IV.8). In terms of the traded volume, 91-day T-bills remained the dominant segment in the secondary market with a share of about 41 per cent. In order to facilitate debt consolidation, the Reserve Bank conducted six switch operations on behalf of the central government amounting to `31,907 crore during H1:2021-22. The weighted average maturity (WAM) of the outstanding stock of G-secs increased to 11.57 years at end-September 2021 from 11.31 years at end-March 2021. The weighted average coupon (WAC) moderated to 7.15 per cent from 7.27 per cent over the same period. Softer than expected CPI print, issuance of new paper 2 The level is the average of par yields of all tenors up to 30-years published by FBIL and the slope (term spread) is the difference in par yields of 3-months and 30-year maturities. The weighted average spread of cut-off yields on state development loans (SDLs) over G-sec yields of comparable maturities declined to 48 bps in H1:2021-22 from 53 bps in H1:2020-21 (Chart IV.9). The average inter-state spread on securities of 10-year tenor (fresh issuances) was 4 bps in H1:2021-22 as compared with 9 bps in H1:2020-21. Corporate bond yields softened during H1:2021-22 while risk premia (over G-sec yields of comparable maturities) exhibited a mixed trend amidst moderation in new issuances. The monthly average yield on AAA- rated 3-year bonds issued by NBFCs declined by 37 bps to 5.32 per cent, while those on corporates and public- sector undertakings (PSUs), \ufb01nancial institutions (FIs) and banks moderated by 32 bps to 5.24 per cent and by 48 bps to 5.33 per cent, respectively (Chart IV.10a). During the same period, the monthly average risk premium or spread on AAA-rated 3-year bonds (over 3-year G-sec yields) increased marginally from 48 bps to 49 bps for NBFCs and from 35 bps to 40 bps for corporates while moderating from 60 bps to 50 bps for PSUs, FIs and banks (Chart IV.10b). Issuances of corporate bonds in the primary market declined to `1.81 lakh crore during H1:2021-22 (up to August 2021) from `3.17 lakh crore during the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart IV.11a). Resource mobilisation in the corporate bond market was overwhelmingly through the private placement route (97.0 per cent). Corporate bond yields eased across tenors and ratings spectrum. For the lowest rated investment grade corporate bonds (BBB-), yields declined by 18 bps (Table IV.1). The market perception of credit risk also improved, with the 3-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads for the State Bank of India and the ICICI Bank moderating by 2 bps and 3 bps, respectively, during H1. foreign portfolio Outstanding investors (FPIs) in corporate bonds declined marginally from `1.33 lakh crore at end-March 2021 to `1.28 lakh crore at end-September 2021. Consequently, their utilisation of the approved limits declined from 24.5 per cent to 22.3 per cent. The daily average secondary market trading volume declined by 26.0 per cent to `7,056 crore during H1 (up to August 2021) over the Spread (bps) (over corresponding risk-free rate) Note: Yields and spreads are computed as monthly averages.

Most of the debt issuances in H1:2021-22 were undertaken by \ufb01rms in \ufb01nancial services, banking/ lending, and the housing \ufb01nance sector term (Chart IV.12). The Indian equity market scaled new highs in H1:2021- 22, lifted by the gradual normalisation of economic activity post the second wave, strong corporate earnings, and pick-up in the vaccination drive. The BSE Sensex gained 19.4 per cent in H1 to close at 59,126 on September 30, 2021 (Chart IV.13a). Indian equities emerged as the best performing amongst peers on a year to date (YTD) basis (Chart IV.13b) with their share in world market capitalisation increasing to 2.93 per cent on September 30, 2021 from the long- term average of 2.43 per cent (Chart IV.13c). During H1:2021-22, FPIs were net buyers to the tune of ` 8,326 crore while net purchases of domestic institutional investors crore (Chart IV.13d). amounted The bull run rode on higher domestic participation, buoyed by the increasing interest of retail investors. Direct retail holdings in NSE listed stocks rose to 7.2 per cent of market capitalisation in June 2021 from 6.4 per cent in December 2019 (Chart IV.14a). The number of dematerialised (Demat) accounts with the country\u2019s two main depositories has gone up from 5.5 crore at end-March 2021 to 6.49 crore at end-July 2021. Furthermore, indirect retail participation through monthly systematic investment plans (SIPs) reached a new high of `9,923 crore in August \u2013 8.1 per cent above March 2021. The number of retail SIP accounts surged to 4.3 crore with 24.9 lakh new accounts registered Note: *Long term average computed for last 10 years.

During H1:2021-22, Note: Data exclude IPOs raised on SME platforms. Sources: SEBI, Bloomberg and RBI staff estimates. 22 IPOs were listed, mobilising `46,316 crore as against `1,798 crore in the corresponding period last year (Chart IV.15a). The amounts raised through rights issues, however, fell sharply to `793 crore in H1from `59,983 crore during the corresponding period of the previous year. The total mobilisation through public and rights issues reduced to `50,529 crore from `76,830 crore over the same period. By May 28, the INR appreciated to `72.48. In June, it traded with a depreciation bias, despite robust FPI equity in\ufb02ows, as the US dollar gained traction. Since then, the INR has moved in both directions driven by FPI \ufb02ows, crude oil prices and incoming information on monetary policy normalisation plans of major advanced economies. The equity risk premium (ERP)3 \u2013 the difference between returns on equity and the risk-free rate \u2013 eased through H1:2021-22 with the gradual recovery in market sentiments and moderated from 6.3 per cent at the height of the pandemic (end-March 2020) to 3.2 per cent by end-September 2021, moving below the pre-pandemic level (Chart IV.15b). The Indian rupee (INR) exhibited two-way movements in H1:2021-22. It traded with a depreciating bias in April 2021 and touched `75.17 per US dollar on April 15 amidst FPI out\ufb02ows and an appreciation of the US dollar (Chart IV.16). The depreciating bias quickly reversed as FPI \ufb02ows rebounded with a sharp fall in domestic COVID-19 cases and a weakening US dollar. The depreciation of the INR in nominal terms (against the US dollar) as well as the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER) in H1 was modest relative to EME peers (Chart IV.17). In terms of the 40-currency nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), the INR depreciated by 0.9 per cent (at end-September 2021 over the average of March 2021), while it appreciated by 1.3 per cent in terms of the 40-currency REER (Table IV.2). The divergence between the two indices essentially re\ufb02ects India\u2019s higher in\ufb02ation vis-\u00e0-vis its major trading partners. During H1, credit offtake improved, with non-food credit growth (y-o-y) increasing to 6.8 per cent on September 24, 2021 from 5.1 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.18). Credit growth among public sector banks remained modest, while there has been some uptick in the case of the private sector banks (Chart IV.19a), which have provided the bulk (56.7 per cent) of the incremental credit extended by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) on a y-o-y basis (as on September 24, 2021). They were followed by public sector banks (33.3 per cent) and foreign banks (10.0 per cent) (Chart IV.19b). (y-o-y) in August 2021 on the back of a favourable monsoon and measures to support the farm sector (Chart IV.20a). Industrial credit growth remained subdued, mainly due to a decline in credit to large industries (which account for more than 80 per cent of credit extended to the sector). Credit to medium, and micro and small industries improved, bene\ufb01tting from the government\u2019s support measures for the MSME sector and the enhancement of the emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS) to support COVID-19 affected sectors. Services sector credit growth decelerated, dampened by the second wave of the pandemic. In terms of the contribution of different sectors in incremental credit (y-o-y basis), personal loans accounted for the largest share (52.5 per cent) followed by the agriculture sector (22.2 per cent) (Chart IV.20b). The overall non-food credit growth in H1:2021-22 remains primarily driven by personal loans and credit to the agriculture sector (Chart IV.20c). Among the major sectors4, credit to agriculture continued to register double-digit growth since to 11.3 per cent April 2021 and accelerated Within industry, credit to textiles, and chemicals and chemical products registered accelerated growth in 4 Data on sectoral credit relate to select banks accounting for around 90 per cent of the total non-food credit. H1:2021-22 (up to August). Credit to infrastructure \u2013 which accounts for around 38 per cent of industrial credit \u2013 also showed improvement, led by credit to roads and airports. Credit growth to food processing, lost momentum, while credit to basic metal and metal products contracted growth to industry were infrastructure and textiles Credit growth to the services sector decelerated to have been raising resources mainly from money and debt markets. Credit growth to transport operators, however, recovered in August 2021 after slipping into negative territory in April 2021 (Chart IV.21c). Credit to the trade sector contributed 1.5 percentage points to the overall credit growth of the services sector in August 2021 (Chart IV.21d). Credit growth to personal loan segment accelerated to 12.1 per cent in August 2021 from 8.5 per cent a year ago, supported by special schemes of banks to support households during the pandemic. Credit to housing, the largest constituent of the personal loan segment, showed signs of recovery in H1: 2021-22 (up to August 2021). ago, largely due to slowdown in credit to NBFCs that The asset quality of SCBs improved during 2021-22 (up to June), with the overall non-performing assets (NPA) ratio declining to 7.5 per cent in June 2021 from 8.0 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.22a). The NPA ratio in respect of retail loans and services increased over the same period (Chart IV.22b). Banks\u2019 non-SLR investments \u2013 covering instruments like CPs, bonds, debentures and shares of public and private corporates \u2013 were lower during H1:2021-22 than a year ago mainly due to lower investment in bonds/shares and debentures (Chart IV.23a). Adjusted non-food credit5 growth increased from 5.1 per cent 5 Sum of non-food credit extended by SCBs and their investments in commercial paper, bonds/shares/debentures issued by private and public corporate sector. (LCR) requirements and collateral buffers for availing With credit offtake remaining muted relative to deposit growth, banks augmented their statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) portfolios. Excess SLR investments rose to 12.5 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) on September 10, 2021 from 11.0 per cent of NDTL at end-March 2021. This provides banks the cushion to meet their liquidity coverage ratio rates of banks improved further in H1:2021-22. The by the MPC of continuing with the accommodative stance, subdued credit demand and the introduction of the external benchmark regime for select sectors in October 2019 aided monetary transmission. There has been a complete pass-through of the policy repo rate cuts to the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans since October 2019 (Table IV.3). The transmission of policy repo rate cuts to the WALR on outstanding loans has also been sizeable at 120 bps in the external benchmark period (Box IV.1). Note: Latest data on WALRs and WADTDR pertain to August 2021. WALR: Weighted average lending rate; WADTDR: Weighted average domestic term deposit rate; MCLR: Marginal cost of funds-based lending rate; TDR: Term deposit rate. Source: RBI. While the Reserve Bank has periodically re\ufb01ned the process of interest rate setting by banks, transmission has hitherto been sluggish as banks relied on own cost of funds, i.e., internal benchmarks. The systems were also characterised by opacity, especially regarding the interest rate resetting practices for existing borrowers. To address these rigidities, the Reserve Bank decided to move to an external benchmark system \u2013 an interest rate outside the control of a bank and not necessarily linked to its internal costs \u2013 for select categories of loans (viz., all new \ufb02oating rate personal or retail loans and \ufb02oating rate loans to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) to the policy repo rate or 3-month or 6-month T-bill rate or other speci\ufb01ed Under this system, any change in the benchmark rate is mandated to be passed on to the lending rates for new and existing borrowers on a one-to-one basis and banks are prohibited from adjusting their spreads for existing borrowers for a period of three years in the absence of any signi\ufb01cant credit event. Re\ufb02ecting the regulatory requirement, the share of external benchmark-linked loans in total outstanding \ufb02oating rate loans increased from 2.4 per cent in September 2019 to 32 per cent in June 2021, contributing to a faster and fuller transmission. Note: Data pertain to 74 SCBs. Figures in table may not add up to hundred due to residual BPLR-linked loans. Source: RBI. There has been a concomitant fall in the share of MCLR- linked loans from 83.6 per cent to 60.2 per cent, over the same period, although these still have the largest share in outstanding \ufb02oating rate loans (Table IV.1.1). As lending rates under the external benchmark regime undergo automatic adjustments with the changes in the benchmark rate, banks are incentivised to adjust their term as well as saving deposit rates to cushion their net interest margins and pro\ufb01tability, which then hastens the adjustment in banks\u2019 marginal cost of funds, and MCLRs (Chart IV.2.1). An error correction model (ECM) using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) framework (Pesaran et al., 2001) for the period January 2013 to June 2021 with the following variables \u2013 weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans (WALR_f ), repo rate (REPO) and credit to deposit ratio (CD Ratio) \u2013 indicates that a 100 Notes: Figures in parentheses are p-values; Adjusted Godfrey LM test for null of no serial correlation (6 lags) (p-value) = 0.88; represents month-on-month change in the respective variables. The adjustment, however, takes time as indicated by the error correction coef\ufb01cient of 0.11 (equation 2), i.e., 11 per cent of the deviation from the equilibrium relationship is corrected every month7. Thus, it takes six months for one-half of the long-run pass-through. The speed of adjustment can be expected to improve as the proportion of external benchmark linked loans increases further. This is borne out by the statistical signi\ufb01cance of the interaction between the changes in the repo rate and the dummy representing the external benchmark period ((cid:39)REPOt*DUMEBLR). 6 Unit root tests indicate that WALR_f, REPO and CD Ratio are I(1).

This has been facilitated by the sustained reduction in the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) \u2013 the one-year median MCLR fell from 8.8 per cent in January 2019 to 7.25 per cent in August 2021 (Chart IV.25)8. sharpest in the case of education loans, followed by other personal loans and loans to large industries (Chart IV.27). Across bank groups, foreign banks exhibited maximum transmission to lending and deposit rates, re\ufb02ecting a higher proportion of their liabilities being made up of low cost and lower duration wholesale deposits, which facilitates a faster repricing of interest rates (Chart IV.26). Among domestic banks, public sector banks (PSBs) and private sector banks (PvBs) exhibited a similar degree of pass-through to lending rates. The WALRs of PSBs, however, remain lower than those of PvBs9. The decline in WALRs on fresh rupee loans as well as outstanding rupee loans has been broad-based across sectors. For fresh loans, the decline in WALR was the 8 With the policy rate cut cycle commencing in February 2019, more and more loans linked to MCLR (primarily in the 1-year bucket) are getting reset from February 2020. 9 The WALR on fresh rupee loans for public sector banks and private sector banks stood at 7.51 per cent and 8.83 per cent, respectively, in August 2021. Spreads of WALRs on fresh rupee loans (relative to 1-year MCLR) are the lowest in the large industry segment. Among retail loans, the spread charged by domestic banks was the lowest in respect of housing loans, given the lower risk of default and the availability of collateral. Other personal loans, i.e., loans other than housing, vehicle and education are mostly unsecured and carry higher credit risk, mirrored in higher spreads (Chart IV.28). The WALRs in respect of fresh rupee loans in the retail segment and loans to MSMEs declined signi\ufb01cantly the period October 2019-August 2021 during (Chart IV.29). In respect of fresh rupee loans linked to the policy repo rate, the spread \u2013 WALR (fresh rupee loans) over the repo rate \u2013 charged by domestic banks during August 2021 was the lowest in the case of housing loans and the highest in the case of other personal loans, in line with their risk pro\ufb01les. The spreads charged by PSBs for vehicle and education loans were lower than those of private banks, while they were higher for MSME loans and other personal loans (Table IV.4). There has been a moderation in deposit rates across tenors (Chart IV.30a). The median term deposit rate on fresh deposits \u2013 based on average card rates on fresh deposits across all tenors \u2013 has declined by 154 bps since March 2020 with a perceptible moderation in shorter tenor deposits of up to one-year maturity (180 bps) (Chart IV.30b). Consequently, the weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on outstanding rupee deposits declined by 135 bps during the period March 2020 to August 2021. The median saving deposit rate for domestic banks, which had remained sticky at 3.5 per cent during October 2017 to May 2020, declined to 3 per cent in June 2020 and has remained at the same level since then. The Government has left the interest rates on Amongst domestic banks, PvBs have exhibited higher pass-through to term deposit rates compared to PSBs, resulting in some convergence in the levels of their deposit rates (Chart IV.31).

The RBI Act, 1934 requires the Reserve Bank to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time, if any, in the public domain. In consonance with the MPC\u2019s accommodative stance, the Reserve Bank continued with liquidity easing measures during H1:2021-22, aimed at nurturing and supporting the nascent growth impulses. The RBI announced a secondary market G-sec acquisition programme or G-SAP 1.0 in April 2021, with a commitment to a speci\ufb01c amount of open market purchases of government securities. The G-SAP is unconventional on several counts. First, the RBI commits upfront the amount to be purchased in contrast to regular OMO purchases which are discretionary. Second, it entails continued support to the market in view of the large government borrowing programme. Third, the size of the purchases is signi\ufb01cantly larger than OMOs in normal times, thus boosting demand for G-secs amidst elevated supply during 2021-22. During Q1, the RBI conducted three auctions under G-SAP 1.0 and purchased G-secs (including SDLs) of `1.0 lakh crore, in line with the announced amount. In Q2, six auctions were conducted under G-SAP 2.0 aggregating `1.2 lakh crore. The G-SAP 2.0 auctions conducted on September 23 and September 30, 2021 for `15,000 crore each were accompanied by simultaneous sales of G-secs of identical amount. Overall, net through OMO purchases, including G-SAP, amounted to `2.4 lakh crore in HI. Under the G-SAP, the RBI purchased both on the run (liquid) and off the run (illiquid) securities across the maturity spectrum, with more than 68 per cent of the purchases concentrated in over 5 to 10-year maturity segment, thus imparting liquidity to securities across the term structure (Table IV.6). By containing volatility in G-sec yields \u2013 the benchmarks for the pricing of other \ufb01nancial market instruments \u2013 G-SAP helped to keep interest rates benign, thereby facilitating monetary transmission. injected Face value of G-sec purchased (` crore) Face value of G-sec purchased (` crore) Up to 5 On the run Off the run Total On the run Off the run Total On the run Off the run Total During Q1:2021-22, currency expansion, build-up of GoI cash balances and the restoration of the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to its pre-pandemic level were the main sources of liquidity leakage while its accretion was through G-SAP and forex purchases (Table IV.7).

Qualitative attributes (such as market sentiments, expectations, political stability and \ufb01nancial news) and quantitative factors (like crude oil prices, central bank\u2019s forex intervention and foreign exchange market turnover) also impact forward premia (Srikanth and Chittedi, 2014). While interest rate differentials explain the forward premia in the long-run in line with CIP, the volatility in the spot rate in\ufb02uences it in the short-run (Biswas et al, 2018). Drawing upon the macro-\ufb01nance literature on modelling the shape of the yield curve through principal component analysis (Diebold et al, 2006), the forward premium curve can be decomposed into its latent factors \u2013 level, slope and curvature. An analysis based on monthly data (January 2015 to June 2021) for tenors spanning 1-12 months indicates that the \ufb01rst three principal components (PCs) explain more than 99 per cent of the variation in the data. The three PCs characterise the level, the slope and the curvature, respectively, of the forward premium curve.10 The determinants of forward premia for three tenors viz., 1-month, 3-months and 12-months are separately short-listed using a machine learning approach (random forest11 methodology) (Dilip et al, 2021). These variables are: (i) the differential between yields on 3-month T-bills for US and India (Int_Diff); (ii) domestic system liquidity as proportion to GDP (Net_LAF); (iii) global economic policy uncertainty index (GEPU); (iv) RBI\u2019s forward (Contd.) 10 The level is the weighted sum of changes in forward premia rates with the same sign across all maturities; a level shock changes the rates by identical amounts across all maturities, indicating a parallel shift of the forward premia curve. The slope weighs changes in rates for short maturities with a negative sign and those of medium and long maturities with a positive sign. Finally, the curvature associates positive signs with short and long-term changes but negative signs with medium-term rate changes; a disproportionate shock to the medium-term rates vis-a-vis the short and long term rates impacts the hump of the curve (Litterman and Scheinkman, 1991). 11 A random forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm that assesses the relative importance of each variable on the prediction. intervention (net forward purchases) as proportion of forex reserves (Forward_Intervention); (v) CPI in\ufb02ation volatility (Vol_Inf); (vi) 3-month realised volatility of NIFTY 50 (Vol_NIFTY50); and (vii) trade de\ufb01cit as proportion to GDP [Trade_De\ufb01cit]. The generalized method of moments (GMM) approach \u2013 more speci\ufb01cally, the continuously updating GMM estimation (CUE) methodology using appropriate instrument variables12 \u2013 is deployed to address endogeneity concerns, after conducting due diligence for the time series properties of the variables. The empirical results suggest positive and statistically signi\ufb01cant impact of interest rate differentials and global uncertainty on the level of the forward premium curve (Table IV.2.1). Stock market turbulence (captured by NIFTY volatility) is associated with a marginal hardening of the level of the forward premia along with a steepening of the curve as traders seek to hedge their positions. The rise in the volatility in domestic in\ufb02ation seems to increase risk aversion among market participants at shorter and longer tenors, thus moderating the extent of the hump in the forward premia curve. The increased availability of domestic liquidity moderates the level and shape of the forward premia curve. Finally, forward interventions by the RBI seems to \ufb02atten the slope and reduce the curvature while increasing the level of the premia. The analysis suggests that forward interventions generally discourage carry trade activities by reducing the steepness of the forward premia curve. In a situation of large surplus liquidity, a steeper curve can trigger a vicious cycle of higher in\ufb02ows and even further increase in the forward premia. Dilip, A., P. Kumar, P. Sachdeva, K.M.

Figures in parenthesis are t-statistics based on heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) corrected standard errors. 12 Apart from lagged variables as instruments, implied volatility of INR per USD rates for 3-months is used as an instrument variable for forward intervention; the residuals from regressing stock market volatility on policy uncertainty are used as an instrument for the stock market variable. With the moderation of the forward book in H1:2021-22 (up to July), the pressure on the forward premia somewhat eased (Chart IV.34). The gradual normalisation of liquidity management liquidity in sync with the revised operations management framework instituted in February 2020 was a key feature of liquidity management during H1:2021-22. As a part of this process, the CRR was restored to its pre-pandemic level of 4.0 per cent of NDTL in two phases of 0.5 percentage point increase in the fortnights beginning March 27, 2021 and May 22, 2021. The surplus liquidity was mopped up through the overnight \ufb01xed rate reverse repo and the VRRR auctions of varying maturities under the LAF. Keeping in view the markets\u2019 feedback and appetite for higher remuneration, the Reserve Bank enhanced the size of the fortnightly VRRR auctions in a phased manner from `2.0 lakh crore during April-July to `2.5 lakh crore on August 13, 2021; `3.0 lakh crore on August 27, 2021; `3.5 lakh crore on September 9, 2021; and `4.0 lakh crore on September 24, 2021. These were supported by \ufb01ne-tuning operations conducted through VRRRs of 3, 4 and 7 days maturities. Notwithstanding the phased increase in the size of VRRRs, the surplus liquidity absorbed through \ufb01xed rate reverse repo remained around `4.7 lakh crore (on an average) in H1 (Chart IV.35). in VRRR size was interpreted as a precursor to reversal of liquidity measures leading to a transient spike in G-sec yield on fears, however, were unfounded as evident from the Re\ufb02ecting the liquidity injections through G-SAP and capital in\ufb02ows, reserve money (RM) increased by 14.7 adjusted for the \ufb01rst-round impact of the change in the CRR) while money supply (M3) increased by 9.3 Apart from G-SAP, the RBI continued with measures to meet targeted sectoral credit needs to nurture the nascent economic recovery in H1. These measures included (i) special re\ufb01nance facilities of `66,000 crore to all-India \ufb01nancial institutions (AIFIs) comprising `25,000 crore to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD); `10,000 crore to the National Housing Bank (NHB); and `31,000 crore to the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to support and nurture the recovery; (ii) term liquidity facility of `50,000 crore to ramp up COVID- related healthcare infrastructure and services in the country; (iii) special long-term repo operations (SLTRO) for small \ufb01nance banks (SFBs) of `10,000 crore to be deployed for fresh lending of up to `10 lakh per borrower; (iv) on-tap liquidity window of `15,000 crore in order to mitigate the adverse impact of the second wave of the pandemic on certain contact-intensive sectors13. Overall, the Reserve Bank has announced liquidity enhancing measures worth `17.2 lakh crore (8.7 per cent of nominal GDP of 2020-21) since February 6, 2020 (Table IV.9). CRR cut Net OMO purchases including G-SAP Term liquidity facility to ease access to emergency health services Domestic \ufb01nancial markets broadly remained stable and in sync with the accommodative policy stance of the MPC and the Reserve Bank\u2019s continued calibrated liquidity injection measures. Market activity was vibrant, with short-term rates easing appreciably along with thinning of spreads. The renewed vigour of capital in\ufb02ows and the infusion of discretionary liquidity through G-SAP resulted in a substantial increase in surplus systemic liquidity, which was modulated through increases in VRRR amounts and \ufb01ne-tuning operations. Monetary transmission improved further amidst nascent signs of an upturn in credit growth. Going forward, liquidity conditions are expected to continue to be accommodative in consonance with the monetary policy stance, through calibrated liquidity management operations. Imparting momentum to the nascent economic recovery process and putting it on a sustained and durable basis through ef\ufb01cient policy transmission would continue to assume primacy in the hierarchy of policy objectives. 13 As an incentive, banks were permitted to park their surplus liquidity up to the size of the loan book created under this scheme with the Reserve Bank under the reverse repo window at a rate which is 25 bps lower than the repo rate i.e., 40 bps higher than the reverse repo rate. The global economic activity gained traction in Q2:2021 (April-June). In Q3, however, the momentum of the global recovery seems to have weakened across the board as the rapid spread of more virulent strains of the virus weighed on business conditions. Elevated commodity prices and overstretched supply chains are keeping input price pressures high, posing upside risks to headline inflation. The divergence in monetary policy actions and stances is amplifying the unequal and uneven nature of the global recovery and increasing the downside risks to the outlook, while global financial markets are turning volatile. In the aftermath of the April 2021 MPR, daily new infections appeared to have peaked in major advanced economies (AEs) and a few emerging market economies (EMEs), allowing easing of restrictions and global economic activity to gain traction in Q2:2021 at a diverging and unequal pace on the basis of scale and speed of vaccination. Starting June, however, the momentum of the global recovery seems to have weakened across the board as the rapid spread of more virulent strains of the virus weighed on business conditions in most major economies, pulling down global purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) readings and is likely to re\ufb02ect in lower GDP growth in Q3. Besides, still rising commodity prices and overstretched supply chains are keeping input price pressures high, posing upside risks to headline in\ufb02ation. Several EME central banks and a few in the AEs have responded with policy rate hikes and unwinding of policy stimulus. The divergence in monetary policy actions and stances is amplifying the unequal and uneven nature of the global recovery and increasing the downside risks to the outlook. Global \ufb01nancial markets remained buoyant up to early-September before increasingly turning volatile. Even as stock markets in a few countries scaled fresh peaks in September 2021, most saw sharp correction. In the bond markets, yields remained range-bound up to August in most AEs but rose sharply in September. In EMEs, bond yields moved bi-directionally but rose in the latter part of September, in sync with the AEs. The US dollar has strengthened in anticipation of taper and higher in\ufb02ation outcomes in the US. Economic activity accelerated in major AEs and EMEs in Q2:2021, but faltered in Q3, with most economies yet to return to their pre-pandemic levels. In the US, the economic rebound that commenced in H2:2020 continued into H1:2021, with GDP bouncing back to its pre-pandemic level in Q2:2021 (Table V.1). Sustained policy support, easing of restrictions and vaccination supported a strong pick-up in consumer spending. Non-farm payroll showed signs of steady improvement during May-July indicating the mending of labour market conditions; however, it softened in August to a seven-month low amidst rising infections. Employment remains below the pre-pandemic level and the Federal Reserve (Fed)\u2019s goal of maximum employment, beset with hiring dif\ufb01culties and labour supply shortages. Incoming data for Q3 also suggest that the momentum of growth may have moderated \u2013 consumer sentiment plummeted in August to its lowest level in nearly a decade due to surging delta variant infections and in\ufb02ation concerns, before rising marginally in September. The manufacturing PMI eased in July due to persistent supply side frictions but improved in the next two months even as the rising infections caseload weighed on the outlook. After slipping into a double dip recession in Q1:2021, the Euro area rebounded sharply in Q2, growing at Quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted, annualised rate (Q-o-q, SAAR) P: Projection.

Signi\ufb01cant progress on vaccination, together with falling rates of incidence, boosted consumer and business sentiments, and brightened the prospects for domestic demand and employment. In Q3, however, the economy seems to have lost some steam, as evident from high frequency indicators. The composite PMI, though in strong expansion, moderated in August and September from its 15-year high in July, as capacity constraints dragged on the manufacturing PMI, while services PMI fell to a four- month low in September. The Japanese economy picked up in Q2 at a pace higher than expected, but much weaker than other major AE peers. Resilient external demand underpinned a recovery in exports and capital expenditure. In Q3, however, the country is less likely to maintain this momentum as the upsurge in cases of more virulent strains pushed the economy into its fourth state of emergency in early July which was extended till September. The fallout from the renewed wave is already getting re\ufb02ected in incoming data as industrial growth turned weaker in July and August and the manufacturing PMI, though in expansion zone, moderated in Q3. The composite PMI remained in contraction zone up to September, re\ufb02ecting a sharp deterioration in business activity in the services sector. In the UK, GDP grew sharply in Q2:2021 \u2013 as against a contraction in Q1 \u2013 as the gradual rollback of COVID- related restrictions together with rapid vaccine rollouts aided a strong rebound in household consumption and public spending. With increasing caseload intensifying the risk of another round of lockdown restrictions, the pace of recovery slowed in Q3. The composite PMI eased for the fourth consecutive month in September as output growth in both manufacturing and services weakened amidst stringent supply constraints. The Chinese economy expanded by 7.9 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2. Successful containment of several sporadic virus outbreaks together with sustained policy measures kept exports and manufacturing activity well supported, thus powering a steady recovery. Domestic consumption, however, remains a weak spot and the economy exhibited signs of slowing down in Q3. Both manufacturing and services PMI slipped back into contraction in August for the \ufb01rst time since April 2020 following the deterioration in business conditions. In September, manufacturing PMI had the neutral reading of 50, i.e., neither paced up vaccination having boosted sentiments. expansion nor contraction.

The PMI manufacturing for the ASEAN Global trade showed signs of revival during Q4:2020 and recovered swiftly during H1:2021 across AEs and EMEs (Chart V.2a). Following the recent resurgence in global trade, the WTO has revised its growth forecast of merchandise trade volume to 10.8 per cent for 2021. However, persisting worldwide shortages in semiconductors and port congestion may moderate global trade recovery in certain sectors (Box V.1). The Baltic Dry Index, which measures shipping costs for a wide variety of bulk commodities such as coal, iron ore and grain, rose to a new high by end-September (Chart V.2b). region was at the neutral level of 50 in September. The world is currently facing an acute shortage of semiconductors, which is the fourth most traded item globally after crude oil, re\ufb01ned oil and cars (BCG-SIA Report, 2021). The global semiconductor market is valued at US$440 billion accounting for around 5 per cent of global goods trade and is expected to grow by 25.1 per cent (US$551 billion) in 2021, driven by key segments such as mobile phones, information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, personal computers, industrial applications, consumer electronics and automobiles (Chart V.1.1a). The buoyant demand for electronic gadgets, cloud computing solutions and auto industry following COVID-19 pandemic led to a huge supply-demand mismatch in the semiconductor industry, causing production delays and in\ufb02ationary pressures across segments forcing companies to reinvent their supply chains. Alix Partners (2021) estimates that the ongoing semiconductor shortage may lead to revenue loss of around US$210 billion in 2021 in the automotive sector. According to Gartner (2021), normalcy is expected to return to semiconductor industry by the second quarter of 2022. Realising critical geo-political concerns associated with semiconductor industry, countries are offering huge incentives to scale up their domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity (Chart V.1.1b). Furthermore, leading semiconductor manufacturers like TSMC and Intel have also planned huge capital expenditure to the tune of US$100 billion and US$43.5 billion, respectively, to tap the elevated demand. The recent investment boom to meet shortages may lead to overcapacity in the long run. The semiconductor industry is at the core of India\u2019s digital transformation into a US$1 trillion digital economy by 2025. The size of the world market for 111 frontier technologies is expected to increase to US$3.2 trillion by 2025 (UNCTAD, 2021) and drive the demand for semiconductors in future. Moreover, the share of software-related automotive electronics in car industry is estimated to increase from 27 per cent in 2010 to 45 per cent by 2030 (Deloitte, 2019). The semiconductor industry is highly capital-intensive with a long gestation period. Annual energy requirements to run large fabrication facilities are estimated at around 169 MWh, suf\ufb01cient to power an Indian city (Kumar, 2021). Moreover, it requires on average 2-4 million gallons of ultra- pure water daily (Baskaran, 2017). Furthermore, wastage disposal associated with semiconductor industry is also capital intensive and raises environmental concerns. The semiconductor industry is also highly cyclical in nature and determined by two variables, namely semiconductor Using a Markov regime-switching model, the expected duration of an expansionary cycle (8 months) is obtained and Chyi, 2006). We extend that line of analysis to the period September 2003 to June 2021 with the following where is de\ufb01ned as the growth rate of worldwide semiconductor sales. The equations (1) - (5) represent the model set up as an AR (4) process where stands for expansion of the semiconductor industry and stands for contraction of the semiconductor industry. The transition probability from expansion to expansion (i.e., from ) is de\ufb01ned as p. On the other hand, the transition probability from contraction to contraction ( ) is de\ufb01ned as q. The empirical results suggest that the expected duration of expansion and contraction in the semiconductor industry is around 16 months and 4 months, respectively. The higher expansionary period re\ufb02ects the increasing industries post demand for semiconductors across COVID-19 (Charts V.1.2a and V.1.2b). Probability of the semiconductor industry being in contraction with initial p=0.5, q=0.5 Sources: World Semiconductor Trade Statistics; and RBI staff estimates. Given the renewed focus on digitalisation and increasing domestic demand for electronic goods with large import dependency, the government has initiated the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) to encourage its domestic production. Incentives in line with those provided by major countries would help develop semiconductor fabrication facilities in India. Fiscal incentives and provision of adequate infrastructure like uninterrupted supply of electricity and ultra-pure water could contribute to India\u2019s emergence as a major player in this industry and provide a conducive environment for the hardware segment to complement the software industry.

Global commodity prices have soared in 2021 so far, with intermittent corrections \u2013 the Bloomberg commodity price index increased by 20.7 per cent during April-September 2021. The food price index of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) increased by 7.0 per cent between March and August 2021 (Chart V.3a). Prices of vegetable oil, cereal and dairy sub-indices have eased more recently because of seasonal production gains and softening import demand. In contrast, sugar and meat prices have continued to increase due to tightening supplies from major exporters amidst rising import demand. Crude oil prices rallied unevenly since April on improved demand prospects. Brent crude crossed US$70 per barrel in June, reaching its then highest level of 2021 in early July. From the second week of July, however, crude oil prices turned volatile \u2013 downward bias was imparted by rapid spread of the contagious delta variant, OPEC plus agreement to ease supply with an additional output of 400,000 barrels per day each month from August and rising stockpiles in the US. Price have \ufb01rmed up since the latter part of August on tightening US supplies owing to slow recovery from disruption caused by Hurricane Ida and lower stockpiles in China. Brent crude prices ruled at nearly three-year highs at end-September, surging by 54.0 per cent on year-to-date basis. prices rose in April and May on strong safe haven demand, but lost sheen in June on account of a strong US dollar. After remaining range-bound around the psychological level of US$1,800 per troy ounce during July to early September, prices plummeted in September with sharp rise in the US treasury yields and the US dollar. Base metal prices measured by the Bloomberg\u2019s base metal spot index increased by 11.4 per cent during April-September 2021. The strong rally in prices witnessed in Q1:2021 continued into the \ufb01rst half of Q2 (Chart V.4). Most industrial metals, including copper and iron peaked in mid-May. The steady recovery in manufacturing activity across most major economies, along with rising supply bottlenecks, underpinned the metals bull run of H1:2021, sparking a debate on potential emergence of a fresh commodity super-cycle (Box V.2). Thereafter, prices for most metals have turned volatile in Q3, with iron giving up all early gains following China\u2019s pro-climate measures. Gold Global commodity markets have picked up momentum in 2021, with a 69.4 per cent increase in the Bloomberg commodity price index from the low of March 2020 (Chart V.2.1a). Metal prices have remained the frontrunner in the recovery (Chart V.2.1b). Prices of iron and tin surged to historic peaks, while copper and aluminium recorded over a decadal high as recovering demand was further propelled by speculative trading. Super cycles are long-period cycles with periods of price upswings of roughly 10-35 years, and are generally perceived to be broad-based, affecting a wide range of commodities (Heap, 2005). They are rare but long-lasting. Such elongated cycles are attributed to structural shifts in the economy, characterised by prolonged period of strong demand outpacing supply. Three demand-driven super cycles have occurred since the late 19th century: during the US industrialisation which began in late 1800s through early 1900s; reconstruction in Europe and Japan in the aftermath of the second world war; and the most recent one driven by rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of China beginning in the early 2000s (Jerrett, 2021). Fitzgerald band-pass (BP) \ufb01lter was deployed to decompose real metal prices (RP) into three components2: a long term trend (RP_LTT); a super cycle component (RP_SC); and other relatively shorter cyclical components (RP_STC) such that: In line with Heap\u2019s (2005) analysis, a super cycle ranges from 20 to 70 years and, therefore, a BP (20,70) \ufb01lter has been applied on each price series to obtain its super cycle component. The long run trend is de\ufb01ned as a cyclical component with periods above 70 years and is extracted using a BP (70,(cid:102)) \ufb01lter3, while short-term cyclical components are de\ufb01ned as cycles with periods of 2 to 20 years and extracted by using BP (2,20) \ufb01lter. The results corroborate the occurrence of three super cycles since the late 1800s (Chart V.2.2). Moreover, the super cycles in the six metals under consideration have strong contemporaneous correlation, except for aluminium-lead and aluminium-zinc (Table V.2.1). Following Cuddington and Jerrett (2008), the statistical \ufb01ltering technique of an asymmetric Christiano and The super-cycle component of each of these metals, barring aluminium and nickel, peaked around 2014- 2016 though they remain above their long-term trend. 2 The ACF BP \ufb01lter has been applied to the natural logarithm of annual real metal prices of six non-ferrous metals, viz. copper, aluminium, lead, zinc, nickel and tin for the period 1900 to 2021. The annual prices from 1960 onwards are sourced from the World Bank. For prior period, back-casting is done by using the US Geological Survey (USGS) data. For 2021, the average of the monthly real prices (nominal prices de\ufb02ated by the US CPI) from January to July is considered. 3 Long term trend can also be de\ufb01ned as the actual series minus all the cyclical components with periods between 2 and 70 years (i.e., both super-cycle and other shorter cyclical components) and thus BP (2,70) and BP (70, (cid:102)) can be treated as complements. c: Lead it is too early to classify the ongoing broad-based price escalation as a new commodity super cycle. Christiano, L. and T. Fitzgerald, 2003, \u2018\u2018The Band Pass Filter,\u2019\u2019 International Economic Review, Vol. 44, No. 2, May, pp. 435-465. Cuddington, J.T. and D. Jerrett, 2008, \u201cSuper Cycles in Real Metals Prices?\u201d, IMF Staff Papers, Vol. 55, No. 4, December, pp. 541-565. This suggests that commodities might still be in the downswing phase of the super cycle that began in early 2000s. In contrast, the shorter cycle components for all metals are showing an upturn, likely re\ufb02ecting supply-side factors such as escalating transport and logistics frictions and costs. Moreover, the recent reversal in prices of some metals weakens the narrative of a new super cycle. Hence, Prices \ufb01rmed up across major AEs, pushing in\ufb02ation above targets for most of them, barring Japan (Table V.3). For major EMEs, barring Indonesia and Thailand, headline in\ufb02ation has remained close to the upper bound of the of\ufb01cial target band or beyond, while for China, in\ufb02ationary pressures have remained subdued in terms of consumer prices, notwithstanding strong upside pressures from producer prices. The return of in\ufb02ation in the US has been stark. CPI in\ufb02ation hit a 13-year high, reaching levels not Notes: (1) In\ufb02ation for US is in terms of personal consumption (2) Quarterly in\ufb02ation is the simple average of in\ufb02ation in each month of the quarter. For Q3:2021, it is the July-August average for all countries except Euro area, South Korea, Indonesia, Phillipines, Thailand and Turkey, for which it is full quarter average. (3) The ECB adopted new monetary policy strategy from July 8, 2021 under which a symmetric 2 per cent in\ufb02ation would be targeted over the medium term unlike the earlier target of \u201cbelow but close to 2 per cent\u2019. The Bank of Canada aims to keep in\ufb02ation at the 2 per cent mid-point of an in\ufb02ation control target range of 1-3 per cent. (4) Brazil\u2019s in\ufb02ation target for 2020 was 4.0 \u00b1 1.5 per cent. seen since the global \ufb01nancial crisis. Fed\u2019s preferred measure of the personal consumer expenditures (PCE) in\ufb02ation, lagged CPI in\ufb02ation but was at 30-year high level during July-August due to high energy and food prices. The surge in pent- up demand following the re-opening of economy, persistent supply-side constraints and high input costs are lending upside to in\ufb02ation. The Fed attributes the spike in in\ufb02ation to transitory factors. In the Euro area, the in\ufb02ation rate moved beyond the European Central Bank (ECB)\u2019s target of 2 per cent, surging to a 13-year high of 3.4 per cent in September on rising energy costs and prices of non-energy industrial goods and services, besides unfavourable base effect. The ECB too, attributes the recent rise in in\ufb02ation to transitory factors and expects it to moderate back to the target once pandemic-induced shocks wane. CPI in\ufb02ation in the UK edged up above the target in May- June and eased back to the 2 per cent target in July. In August, however, the in\ufb02ation rate soared to 3.2 per cent, the highest ever jump in rate, mainly due to an unfavourable base effect. In Japan, unlike its AE counterparts, CPI remained in de\ufb02ation for the eleventh consecutive month in August as COVID-19 continued to impact demand, keeping core in\ufb02ation subdued, while a sharp drop in monthly mobile phone charges added to the downside (Chart V.5a). Among major EMEs, CPI in\ufb02ation in Brazil has been above the upper bound of the tolerance band around the in\ufb02ation target since February 2021. In August, CPI in\ufb02ation rose to its highest reading since February 2016, primarily led by a surge in electricity and fuel prices amidst supply disruptions brought in by the worst drought witnessed by the country in almost a century. High global commodity prices, the depreciating Brazilian real and reviving demand are imparting upward pressure on prices. In Russia, in\ufb02ation has been above the of\ufb01cial target level since November 2020, scaling to a \ufb01ve-year high in August as rising in\ufb02ation expectations, recovery in demand and strained supply capacity have kept in\ufb02ationary picked up from April due to increase in fuel costs, however, in\ufb02ation eased due to softening transport prices and favourable base effect before rising again on the other hand, remains an outlier with CPI in\ufb02ation remaining highly subdued, primarily due to decline in food prices as also easing costs Extraordinary policy measures by monetary and \ufb01scal authorities continue to support economies and ease \ufb01nancial conditions, helping to contain \ufb01nancial stability risks. The IMF estimates that since March 2020, US$16.5 trillion or about 15.9 per cent of global GDP had been pledged as \ufb01scal support in response to the pandemic, with higher support extended by AEs vis-\u00e0-vis the EMEs (Table V.4). While most of the \ufb01scal measures in the EMEs had expired in 2020, almost US$4.6 trillion worth of measures remain available to AEs as of early July 2021. producer price index, however, has risen sharply, pushing factory-gate in\ufb02ation to its highest level in The total monetary support extended globally by central banks is estimated to be about US$18.0 trillion as of August 20214. This support has been predominantly in the form of asset purchases, around US$11.6 trillion, followed by lending operations of US$4.4 trillion. 4 These are RBI staff estimates, based on BIS database available on https://www.bis.org/publ/work934.htm. This database is for 39 major economies \u2013 11 AEs and 28 EMEs and numerical estimates for several measures listed are not available. As such the estimate might not fully re\ufb02ect the policies taken by these central banks in response to COVID-19. Monetary policy stances have diverged across countries, with a few major AEs and EMEs continuing to maintain an accommodative stance while others have begun/continued with the withdrawal of monetary stimulus. The US Fed maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 0.25 per cent and the monthly pace of asset purchases at US$120 billion in all its meetings held in Q2 and Q3. In June, the Fed effected a hike of 5 basis points (bps) in the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 0.15 per cent. The interest rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) operations was also increased by 5 bps to 0.05 per cent. Effective July 29, the Fed merged the interest rates on excess reserves and required reserves to a single interest rate on reserve balances. The Fed also announced two standing lending facilities, both overnight and collateralised, viz., domestic standing repurchase agreement facility and a repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities. The latter \u2013 initially a temporary facility introduced in end-March 2020 and extended up to September 2021 \u2013 is now a permanent facility. The September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement noted that if the progress towards its maximum employment and in\ufb02ation goals continued as expected, a moderation in the pace of asset purchases would be warranted soon. The FOMC also doubled the per-counterparty limit for ON RRP operations to US$160 billion per day, effective September 23, 2021. The ECB maintained a hold on its policy rate and the quantum of asset purchases in its meetings in April and June. On July 8, the ECB unveiled its new monetary policy strategy under which a symmetric 2 per cent in\ufb02ation target was adopted, as against the earlier target of below but close to 2 per cent. The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) remains the measure of the price level5 and the primary monetary policy instrument is the set of ECB policy rates. With the policy rates ruling close to their effective lower bound, the ECB would likely resort to other instruments such as forward guidance, asset purchases, longer-term re\ufb01nancing operations and other new policy instruments as required. As part of the strategy review, the ECB also announced a detailed roadmap up to 2024 for its comprehensive action plan on climate change. In its July meeting, the \ufb01rst under the new framework, the ECB maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance to meet its in\ufb02ation target and provided forward guidance that interest rates would remain at their current level or lower till the in\ufb02ation target was durably achieved. In its September meeting, the ECB announced a moderately lower pace of asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), without reducing the overall quantum of the purchase programme that is scheduled to end by March 2022. 5 As a multi-year project, the EU's statistical agency \u2013 Eurostat \u2013 will lead a project to include costs related to owner-occupied housing in the HICP to better measure the in\ufb02ation relevant for households. In the interim, the ECB will also consider initial estimates of the cost of owner-occupied housing in conjunction with the other broader in\ufb02ation measures for monetary policy assessment. It has kept purchases under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) unchanged. The Bank of England (BoE) maintained a pause on the bank rate at its all-time low of 0.1 per cent and kept the total quantum of asset purchases unchanged in its meetings in May, June, August and September. In its August meeting, the BoE indicated that a modest tightening of monetary policy over its three-year forecast period is likely and it signalled that, given appropriate economic circumstances, it would begin unwinding its quantitative easing by not re-investing maturing assets once the bank rate is raised to 0.5 per cent6. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) in its meetings in April, June, July and September kept the monetary policy parameters \u2013 the key policy rates and the quantum of asset purchases \u2013 unchanged. In July, the BoJ sketched the preliminary outline of the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Efforts on Climate Change. The new measure would come into effect in 2021 under which the BoJ would provide interest-free loans against collateral for up to one year, with possibility of rollover, for on-lending to projects that address climate change7. Moreover, banks would be allowed to add twice the amount of any borrowing under the scheme to their macro add-on balances, which would earn 0 per cent interest as against the policy rate, which is currently (-) 0.1 per cent. Central banks of four AEs, viz., Iceland, Czech Republic, South Korea and Norway have raised their policy rates in 2021 so far. The central bank of Iceland has effected two hikes of 25 bps each and the Czech National Bank has raised rates thrice to a cumulative increase of 125 bps. Bank of Korea and Norges Bank raised policy rates by 25 bps in August and September, respectively (Chart V.6a). Within the EMEs, there has mostly been status quo or a move towards unwinding monetary accommodation, though some countries have extended the stimulus also. For instance, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) increased the liquidity in the system by lowering the reserve requirement for most \ufb01nancial institutions by 50 bps effective July 15, freeing up about 1 trillion yuan (approximately US$154.3 billion) of liquidity to support the real economy. The PBoC has, however, maintained the one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) at 3.85 per cent since April 2020. Amongst other BRICS central banks, Banco Central do Brasil followed up on its 75 bps rate action of March with equal hikes of 75 bps each in May and June and 100 bps each in August and September. The Bank of Russia followed up on its 25 bps rate hike of March with hikes of 50 bps each in April and June, 100 bps in July and 25 bps in September. The South African Reserve Bank maintained a pause in its May, July and September meetings. The Bank of Canada (BoC) maintained its policy rate and the forward guidance in its meetings in April, June, July and September but effected tapers of CAD$1 billion (approximately US$0.8 billion)8 in its weekly purchases of government bonds in the April and July meetings, reducing the weekly pace of asset purchases to CAD$2 billion (approximately US$1.6 billion). The central bank of Turkey, which had maintained status quo since a hike of 200 bps in March 2021, cut rates by 100 bps in September attributing high in\ufb02ation to transitory factors and noting that monetary tightening had lowered credit and domestic demand. Amongst other EME central banks, Banco de M\u00e9xico hiked rates by 25 bps each in June, August 6 The previous guidance of June 2018 had set a higher threshold of 1.5 per cent. 7 Green loans/bonds, sustainability-linked loans/bonds with performance targets related to efforts on climate change and transition \ufb01nance. 8 The US$ approximations for all amounts mentioned in another currency in this Chapter are based on the exchange rate (Bloomberg) on the date of announcement of the measure. and September, while the Central Bank of Chile raised rates by 25 bps in July and 75 bps in August (Chart V.6b). The central banks of Peru and Hungary have also raised rates in recent months. Global \ufb01nancial markets remained buoyant and easy \ufb01nancing conditions prevailed; however, volatility returned to the markets in September. Stock markets in a few AEs and EMEs scaled fresh peaks in September but slid in most countries. Bond yields, which had remained low up to August, edged up in September due to large sell-offs. The US dollar rallied in the wake of higher in\ufb02ation and in\ufb02ation expectations and the Fed announcement on commencement of the US taper in the near future. The EME \ufb01nancial markets, unlike 2013, did not experience a major upheaval in Q3 despite taper guidance by the Fed. Among AEs, the US equity markets continued to scale a new peak every month in Q2 and Q3, even after the Fed indication of likely taper. After peaking in early- September, the US market fell, led by technology stocks, and recorded its \ufb01rst monthly decline since January. Among other major AEs, European stock markets had seven consecutive months of gains up to August \u2013 the longest rally since the end of the sovereign debt crisis in 2012 \u2013 which came to an end in September. Strong corporate earnings and the accommodative monetary policy stance of the ECB had helped keep the markets bullish. The UK stock indices rose during Q2 due to the rapid pace of vaccination, attractive valuations and high dividend yield but have been \ufb02at thereafter. The Nikkei, which was trending down since Q2 as Japan lagged the other three major AEs in its pace of vaccination and infection control, rose from the last week of August due to election fever and increased pace of vaccination overtaking the US. EME stock indices had been essaying the fault lines in global recovery, and trending down since June due to the two-speed nature of the recovery, moderation of capital \ufb02ows and rapid spread of the delta variant of the virus (Chart V.7). The EME stock markets got buffeted in August with China\u2019s regulatory crackdown and continued to fall in September on concerns relating to China and change in monetary policy stance of several AEs. Stock markets in EMEs such as India and Russia, however, notched all-time highs in September. Bond yields in major AEs trended down in Q2:2021 and remained range-bound in Q3 up to August, the accommodative monetary policy re\ufb02ecting stance maintained by the Fed, the ECB and the BoJ. Also, due to the persistent threat to recovery with rapid spread of the delta variant, the safe haven demand for government bonds continued. Since the September monetary policy meetings of the Fed and BoE, bond yields shot up sharply in most AEs led by large sell-offs. In the US, long-term treasury yields, which had risen at a rapid clip in Q1:2021 in line with rise in in\ufb02ation expectations, treaded down in April-July even as in\ufb02ation and in\ufb02ation expectations remained high (Chart V.8a). In August, however, movements in long-term yields were more range-bound. Despite the signi\ufb01cant rise in b: Portfolio Flows to EMEs September, the 10-year yield at end-September was 25 bps lower than that prevailing at end-March 2021. Yields in the EMEs moved bi-directionally till August \u2013 rising in those countries that began normalising monetary policy, while remaining soft in those with continued central bank support. EME bond yields rose in September, in line with the global trend (Chart V.8b). In currency markets, the US dollar has been strengthening since June 2021 on better economic prospects for the US as also higher in\ufb02ation outcomes. The dollar rally strengthened in September in expectation of commencement of US taper later in 2021. In contrast, the emerging market currencies have depreciated after peaking in the second week of June (Chart V.9a). This was mainly triggered by retrenchment of capital \ufb02ows following the release of the FOMC statement where dot plots suggested two likely rate rises in 2023 as against no rate hike forecast in March. Nevertheless, overall capital \ufb02ows in September were higher than in August due to large sovereign bond issuances by EMEs (Chart V.9b). The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index increased by 2.2 per cent in Q2:2021 but declined by 0.9 per cent in Q3:2021. The multi-speed economic recovery across countries is becoming increasingly susceptible to renewed bouts of rapid spread of infections. There has been a perceptible slowdown of economic activity across the globe in recent months, particularly in Asia. In\ufb02ation remains high across the world, with supply disruptions becoming more widespread. There is a risk that above target in\ufb02ation may persist longer than anticipated in several economies. The pervading threat of the delta variant has led monetary authorities \u2013 that had earlier signalled unwinding \u2013 to be on hold, while incremental in\ufb02ationary pressures have made others signal a sooner unwinding. ", "file9": "The rebound from the COVID-19 induced slump has been sharper than anticipated and economic activity is expected to rebound strongly in 2021-22. Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation receded into the tolerance band beginning December 2020. Core inflation pressures remain elevated, reflecting pass-through from higher crude oil and non-oil commodity prices, high fuel and other taxes post-COVID and increased operating costs. The evolving COVID-19 trajectory and progress on vaccination remain the key drivers of economic activity and inflation, globally and in India. Section 45-ZA of the RBI Act, 1934 requires that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), determine the inflation in every five years. Accordingly, in a notification on consultation with the RBI, retained the inflation target The experience with successfully maintaining price policy since the institution of the inflation targeting framework in 2016 would be reinforced by the retention of the target and the tolerance band.1 The experience during the COVID-19 period has testified to the flexibility of the framework to respond to sharp momentum in Q4:2020, driven by multiple vaccine approvals, the launch of inoculation drives in many countries and the extension of monetary and fiscal stimuli. On the other hand, new mutants of the COVID-19 virus, second/third waves of infections, renewed lockdowns in many countries and uneven access to vaccines across countries continue to weigh on the outlook. The resurgence of commodity price inflation, supported by abundant global liquidity, has fuelled reflation trade in global financial markets. Despite the promise of continued accommodative monetary policies by central banks, bond yields have firmed up from very low levels, spurred by inflation concerns and expectations of stronger growth. Amidst stretched valuations, equity prices have become sensitive to the hardening of yields. In turn, exchange rates have become volatile, with capital outflows from emerging economies in early March interrupting their earlier ebullience on risk-on sentiments. in October 2020, domestic economic activity has turned out to be better than anticipated on the back than in the preceding quarters of the financial year. Crude oil prices jumped sharply on production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plus and on anticipation of stronger demand. Non-oil commodity prices have risen substantially across the board, putting upward pressures on inflation in commodity importing countries. Gold prices eased from the highs reached in August 2020 on a stronger US dollar and expectations of economic recovery. While inflation is expected to remain The global economy is pulling out of the loss of subdued in advanced economies (AEs) and most of the emerging market economies (EMEs) on account of negative output gaps, the large fiscal and monetary stimuli and elevated commodity prices have raised inflation concerns over longer horizons in advanced economies and in the nearer-term in the case of EMEs. during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remained within the target going forward. Turning to the domestic economy, the gross domestic product (GDP) shrugged off the contractions of preceding quarters and moved into expansion zone in Q3:2020-21 (+ 0.4 per cent, year-on-year). High frequency indicators point to the growth momentum gaining strength in Q4 although the surge in COVID-19 infections in a few states in March 2021 imparts uncertainty to the assessment. The outlook for the agriculture sector remains bright, with higher rabi sowing, above normal north-east monsoon and adequate reservoir levels. Inflation receded into the tolerance band beginning December 2020 after breaching the upper threshold of 6 per cent for six consecutive months (June-November 2020). The late winter easing of vegetable prices that caused this softening has dissipated, however. In its February 2021 print, headline inflation firmed up again, with upside pressures getting generalised across constituents of core inflation. In the run up to the December 2020 meeting, CPI inflation had increased to 7.6 per cent in October 2020 with food inflation surging to double digits across protein-rich items, edible oils, vegetables and spices on multiple supply shocks. Core inflation had remained sticky and was seen to firm up as economic activity normalised and demand picked up. At the same time, with the signs of economic recovery being far from broad-based and still dependent on sustained policy support, the MPC decided to maintain status quo on the policy rate and continue with the accommodative stance set out in the October resolution. By the time the MPC met in February 2021, CPI inflation had declined to 4.6 per cent in December 2020 on the back of a larger than anticipated deflation in vegetable prices. The MPC noted the sharp correction in food prices but was concerned that some pressures persisted, and core inflation remained elevated. As the recovery was still to gather firm traction and continued policy support remained crucial, the MPC unanimously decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and maintain its accommodative stance. During October 2020-March 2021, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met thrice. In the October 2020 meeting, the MPC noted that the revival of the economy from the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic assumed the highest priority in the conduct of monetary policy. High inflation was seen as easing with the unlocking of the economy, restoration of supply chains and normalisation of activity. Hence, the MPC decided to look through the inflation spike and unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged. It also voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least The MPC\u2019s voting pattern reflects the individual members\u2019 assessments, expectations and policy preferences (Table I.1). The MPC\u2019s unanimous vote on the policy rate in all the three meetings during October 2020-March 2021 was a reflection of the unprecedented pandemic and an unambiguous consensus on continued policy support. Chapters analyse macroeconomic developments during October 2020-March 2021. Turning to the outlook, the evolution of key Given the Covid-19 impact on activity, revenues, and expenditures and factoring in the additional borrowings announced, fiscal deficits are expected to be significantly higher First, global crude oil prices have hardened notably since November 2020 on the back of production cuts by the OPEC and non-OPEC allies (OPEC plus) and expected revival in demand with vaccine rollouts. Reflecting these developments as well as the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, Brent crude crossed US$ 70 per barrel in early March. Prices, however, corrected to around US$ 65 in the second half of March over concerns of demand faltering on rising COVID-19 infections and increase in crude stockpiles. Taking into account these developments, crude prices (Indian basket) are assumed at US$ 64.6 per barrel for 2021-22 in the baseline, 58 per cent above the October MPR baseline for 2020-21 (Chart I.1). Second, the nominal exchange rate (the Indian rupee or INR vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar) has moved in a range of INR 72-75 per US dollar since October 2020. The INR remained under depreciating pressure till mid- November 2020 due to COVID-related uncertainty, risk Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. aversion and capital outflows. Subsequently, the INR appreciated, riding on the domestic recovery gaining traction, decline in the number of new infections, vaccine rollout, and the measures announced in the Union Budget 2021-22 to revive the economy. The INR depreciated sharply in late February on elevated global financial market volatility following the spike in sovereign bond yields in the US and other major AEs. Taking these developments into account, the exchange rate is assumed at INR 72.6 per US dollar for 2021-22 in the baseline. Third, global economic activity has improved relative to the outlook in October 2020 with vaccine rollouts and easing of lockdown restrictions, although it remains uneven across countries and sectors. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its January 2021 World Economic Outlook (WEO) update projected the global economy to expand by 5.5 per cent in 2021 (Chart I.2); the outlook remains heavily contingent upon the progress with COVID-19 containment measures and the scale and speed of the vaccination programme. The World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) trade barometers suggest a moderation in global merchandise and services trade volumes from the marked improvement in Q4:2020. After breaching the upper tolerance threshold of 6.0 per cent for six consecutive months (June-November 2020), CPI inflation fell in December 2020 and eased further in January 2021 to 4.1 per cent on the back of a sharp correction in vegetable prices and softening of cereal prices. It rebounded to 5.0 per cent in February, however, driven primarily by base effects. Core inflation pressures remained elevated, with inflation excluding food and fuel at 6.0 per cent in February reflecting pass-through to retail prices from higher crude oil and non-oil commodity prices, high fuel and other taxes post-COVID and increased operating costs (Chapter II). Looking ahead, three months and one year ahead median inflation expectations of urban households rose by 80 basis points (bps) and 10 bps, respectively in the March 2021 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey2 in tandem with higher food and oil prices. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate also increased for both three months and one year ahead horizons vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round (Chart I.3). Manufacturing firms polled in the January-March 2021 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey3 expected further input cost pressures from 2 The Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households is conducted in 18 cities and the results of the March 2021 survey are based on responses from 5,955 households. 3 The results of the January-March 2021 round of the industrial outlook survey are based on responses from 967 companies. managers\u2019 index (PMI) survey for the manufacturing sector also reported strong increase in input prices in March 2021 along with higher output prices; for the services sector, input cost inflation was at an eight- year high while selling prices remained stable in February, reflecting efforts to boost sales. Professional forecasters surveyed4 by the Reserve Bank in March 2021 expected CPI inflation to ease from 4.9-5.0 per cent in H1:2021-22 to 4.3 per cent in Q3 and revert to 5.0 per cent in Q4 (Chart I.5). raw materials in Q1:2021-22; moreover, positive sentiments on profit margins rose on the back of higher selling prices, suggesting a return of pricing power (Chart I.4). The IHS Markit\u2019s purchasing Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from structural and other time-series models, CPI inflation is projected to average 5.0 per cent in Q4:2020-21, 5.2 per cent in Q1:2021-22 and Q2, 4.4 per cent in Q3, and 5.1 per cent in Q4, with risks broadly balanced (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence in Q4:2021-22 are 3.3-6.9 per cent and 2.4-7.8 per cent, respectively. Note: Net response is the difference between the respondents reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism. The range is -100 to 100. A positive/ negative value of net response is considered as optimistic/pessimistic from the viewpoint of respondent firms. Therefore, higher positive values of selling prices indicate increase in output prices while lower values for the cost of raw materials indicate higher input price pressures and vice versa.

The QPM is a forward- looking, open economy, calibrated, new-Keynesian gap model, and incorporates specific characteristics of the The model properties of these features can be best represented through impulse response functions which in response to shocks. First, an expansionary structural fiscal shock contributes to demand pressures and creates a positive output gap. Increasing debt could contribute With a view to enriching the model\u2019s analytics and to more comprehensively, the model structure has been expanded and the parameters of the QPM recalibrated, depreciation together lead to higher inflation, warranting monetary policy action (Chart I.1.1a). On the other hand, taking into account pre-COVID period data (up to Q4:2019) if the fiscal deficit shock is cyclical, it has a modest impact and latest empirical findings.

The cost-push implications are also incorporated in the enhanced aggregate supply block. A historical decomposition of the shocks suggests that the FIT framework helped in anchoring inflation expectations during 2016-20 leading to lower headline as well as core interaction with the exchange rate management, guided by the objective of containing excess volatility in the foreign exchange market. This recognises the costs associated with spurts in volatility in the exchange rate inflation.

Sentiments in the manufacturing sector for the quarter ahead strengthened further in the January-March 2021 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, reflecting optimism on production, order books, capacity utilisation, employment conditions and the overall business situation (Chart I.8). Surveys by other agencies also indicate optimism on future business expectations (Table I.3).

Credit growth of scheduled commercial banks Combined gross fiscal deficit (per cent of GDP) Overall, economic activity is gathering strength, supported by the recovery in both demand and supply channels, sustained rollout of the vaccination programme, growth-enhancing proposals in the Union Budget and highly accommodative monetary conditions. Taking the baseline assumptions, the survey indicators, and model forecasts, real GDP growth6 is projected to pick up from (-) 8.0 per cent in 2020-21 to 10.5 per cent in 2021-22 \u2013 with a quarterly path of 26.2 per cent in Q1, 8.3 per cent in Q2, 5.4 per cent in Q3, and 6.2 per cent in Q4 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced (Chart I.10 and Table I.4). For 2022-23, assuming a normal monsoon, and no major exogenous or policy shocks, the structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 6.8 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 6.2-7.3 per cent. Note: GNDI: Gross National Disposable Income. Sources: RBI staff estimates; and Survey of Professional Forecasters (March 2021). There are upside as well as downside risks to the baseline growth path. A faster decline in COVID-19 infections helped by a rapid vaccination drive, large pent-up demand for contact-intensive services, and stronger global demand provide an upside to the baseline growth path. The uncertainty associated with the spread of COVID-19, including new mutants of the virus, deviation of the south-west monsoon from the baseline assumption of a normal monsoon, and elevated crude oil prices and global financial market volatility pose downside risks. 6 The Central government in February 2021 decided to bring the off-budget part of food subsidies on-budget, which has resulted in GDP contraction (-8.0 per cent) being notably higher than that (-6.5 per cent) in gross value added (GVA) in 2020-21. This budgetary treatment would especially depress reported GDP growth for Q4:2020-21 (see Chapter III). Note: The fan chart depicts uncertainty around the baseline projection path. The baseline projections are conditioned upon the assumptions set out in Table I.2. The thick green shaded area represents 50 per cent confidence interval, implying that there is 50 per cent probability that the actual outcome will be within the range given by the thick green shaded area. Likewise, for 70 per cent and 90 per cent confidence intervals, there is 70 per cent and 90 per cent probability, respectively, that the actual outcomes will be in the range represented by the respective shaded areas.

A surge in global bond yields \u2013 as experienced in February 2021 on reflation trade \u2013 could induce large global financial market volatility, disorderly adjustment in asset prices and disrupt global demand. In such a scenario, if global recovery is 100 bps below the baseline, domestic growth and inflation could be lower by around 40 bps and 30 bps, respectively, from the baseline trajectories. Conversely, success in containing the spread of new mutants, widespread and equitable distribution of vaccines across the world, and additional policy stimulus could provide a boost to global economic activity. In this scenario, assuming that global growth surprises by 100 bps on the upside, domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by around 40 bps and 30 bps, respectively (Charts I.11a and I.12a). The baseline projections of inflation and growth are conditional on the assumptions of key domestic and international macroeconomic and financial conditions described in the previous sections. The inherent uncertainties associated with such assumptions have exacerbated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and could have a significant bearing on the inflation and growth trajectories. This section explores plausible alternative scenarios to assess the balance of risks around the baseline projections. The COVID-19 pandemic induced the severest global recession in decades in 2020. Global growth is expected to recover to 5.5 per cent in 2021, reflecting base effects, the expected moderation in new infections, the rollout of the vaccination programme and large monetary and fiscal support. However, the uncertainty about the pandemic\u2019s spread and its containment continues to pose high risks to the global outlook on both sides. A faster spread of mutated coronavirus International crude oil prices have risen sharply on production cuts and hopes of demand revival. For a net energy importer like India, the dynamics of international crude price movements have significant macroeconomic implications. A quicker containment of COVID-19 inducing higher global growth than the baseline and a faster closing of the global output gap along with sustained production cuts by the OPEC plus could lead to a sharper increase in international crude oil prices. Assuming crude oil price to be 10 per cent above the baseline, domestic inflation and growth could be higher by 30 bps and weaker by around 20 bps, respectively, over the baseline. Conversely, crude oil prices could soften if the recovery is more subdued owing to a faster spread of virus mutations, the delays in vaccination or improved supplies of shale gas. As a result, if the price of the crude falls by 10 per cent relative to the baseline, inflation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 20 bps to growth (Charts I.11a and I.12a). The INR has exhibited two-way movements over the past six months, reflecting both global and domestic factors. Looking ahead, heightened volatility in global financial markets, especially a snapback in global sovereign bond yields \u2013 as observed in February 2021 \u2013 could lead to a broader risk aversion to EME assets and net capital outflows. In such a scenario, should the INR depreciate by 5 per cent from the baseline, inflation could move up by around 20 bps while GDP growth could be higher by around 15 bps through increased net exports (Charts I.11b and I.12b). On the other hand, given India\u2019s relatively better growth determining the food as well as headline inflation (Charts I.11b and I.12b). there could be INR appreciation. If the INR appreciates GDP growth could moderate by around 20 bps and 15 Food inflation has softened since December 2020, largely led by the sharp fall in prices of vegetables and moderation in prices of cereals. Going forward, management measures could moderate food inflation bps on food inflation. Higher inflation expectations could then add to sustained pressures on headline Domestic economic activity is widely expected to rebound strongly in 2021-22. Rapid vaccination drive, large pent-up demand, investment enhancing measures by the government and better external demand provide an upside to the baseline growth path while surge in infections, new mutants, deviation of the south-west monsoon from the baseline assumption of a normal monsoon, higher crude oil and non-oil commodity prices and global financial market volatility impart downside risks to the baseline growth path. Lingering supply chain disruptions, rising global crude oil prices and stronger pass-through of input costs could push headline inflation above the baseline. There is also the probability of softer international crude oil prices on the back of a weaker than anticipated global demand, bountiful foodgrains production and effective supply management coming together to ease inflation more than anticipated. The evolving COVID-19 trajectory and progress on vaccination remain the key drivers of economic activity and inflation, globally and in inflation. The baseline assumes a normal south-west outturn on either side would be a critical factor in In 2020-21, inflation breached the upper tolerance band of 6 per cent for six consecutive months in the post-lockdown period (June-November 2020) due to a series of cost-push shocks \u2013 supply chain disruptions; weather shocks; higher crude oil and other commodity prices; and higher taxes. The sharp correction during December-January was reversed on adverse base effects in February. Core inflation remained sticky at elevated levels. Costs of farm and industrial inputs recovered with the gradual unlocking of the economy and rural wage growth moderated although it remained higher than in the pre-lockdown period. In the months following the publication of the October 2020 MPR, inflationary pressures got accentuated and headline inflation1 remained above the upper tolerance threshold. Core inflation also stayed sticky at elevated levels. During December 2020-January 2021, however, there was a sharp correction and inflation eased significantly, moving closer to the target, only to reverse to 5.0 per cent in February 2021, primarily due to adverse base effects.

Gold prices remained elevated in Q3:2020-21 over COVID-19 concerns, supported by highly accommodative with favourable base effects, resulted in headline inflation declining by 2.3 percentage points. In January 2021, headline inflation moderated further due to a large negative momentum engendered by of around 70 bps resulted in a substantial pick-up in 2020-21 was centred at 4.9 per cent, higher than the sub-4 per cent levels seen in recent years (Chart II.4).

For more details, see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. d: CPI excluding Food and Fuel basis3 increased in January-February 2021, indicative of price pressures across the CPI basket (Chart II.5).4 The relative role of various demand and supply shocks impinging upon the inflation dynamics can be captured through vector autoregression (VAR) estimates and historical decomposition.5 The high inflation episode in Q3:2020-21 was predominantly due to supply shocks. In Q4, supply side factors turned benign pulling down headline inflation. On the other hand, easy monetary conditions and the firming up 3 In view of the non-availability of CPI item level data for the period March-May 2020, the diffusion indices have been constructed with item level indices without seasonal adjustment. 4 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. A reading above 50 for the diffusion index signals a broad expansion or generalisation of price increases and a reading below 50 signals broad-based price decline. 5 Historical decomposition estimates the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period (Q4:2010-11 to Q4:2020-21) based on a vector autoregression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013crude oil prices; exchange rate (INR per US$), asset price (BSE Sensex), CPI; the output gap; rural wages; the policy repo rate; and money supply (M3). All variables other than policy repo rate are growth rates. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et ; where et represents a vector of shocks. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. of asset and crude oil prices contributed positively to the deviation of inflation from trend levels in Q3 and Q4. Muted demand conditions and moderation in rural wage growth pulled down inflation in Q3 and Q4, offsetting these effects (Chart II.6a). durable goods with a 30-day recall) remained elevated (Chart II.6b). Imported components contributed 0.5 percentage points to headline inflation in February 2021, driven by gold, silver, edible oils and higher High volatility in perishable goods (non-durable goods with a 7-day recall6) from supply shocks in both directions had a significant bearing on the inflation trajectory. With the surge in vegetable prices, the contribution of perishables to overall inflation increased to 55.3 per cent during September- November 2020 from 46.8 per cent in June-August 2020. Subsequently, as vegetable prices corrected, perishables\u2019 contribution decreased sharply to 32.0 per cent during December 2020-January 2021. In February 2021, following the lower rate of deflation in the prices of vegetables, perishables\u2019 share increased to 38.6 per cent. Reflecting the increase in prices of protein-based food, edible oils and other food Food inflation rose sharply to 10.1 per cent in October 2020 and remained above 6 per cent for 14 consecutive months till November 2020. It moderated in January 2021 before picking up to 4.3 per cent in February 2021. These large variations were primarily driven by movements also aided the easing in food inflation. On the other hand, there were upward pressures from oils and fats, 6 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO).

Despite a sizeable moderation, inflation in five out of twelve food sub-groups was still in double digits in February 2021. Seven of the twelve sub- groups recorded increases above the historical average (Chart II.8). Rural and urban food inflation exhibited broadly similar movements, with no significant difference between month-over-month changes in prices of food and its sub-groups in rural and urban areas.7 In the case of cereals (weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group), a bumper kharif rice production and record buffer stocks \u2013 around 6.7 times the norms for rice and 2.1 times for wheat as on March 16, 2021 \u2013 led to easing in inflation to (-)0.3 per cent in February 2021 from 7.9 per cent in June 2020.

Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI - protein based food. Inflation in prices of vegetables (weight of 6.0 per cent in the CPI and 13.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) rose steeply to a peak of 22.1 per cent in October 2020 and then corrected rapidly to move into deflation during December 2020-February 2021, driven primarily by a large fall in onion, tomato and potato prices (Chart II.9). Potato price inflation reached a peak of 107.0 per cent in November 2020. Higher imports and fresh arrivals of early rabi production in the market led to a sharp easing in prices during December 2020-February 2021, with a deflation of (-) 21.3 per cent in February 2021.

To contain the escalation in prices, the Government imposed an export ban on onions in September 2020 (removed in January 2021), increased imports, released buffer stocks and imposed stock holding limits on wholesalers and retailers. These steps, along with fresh arrivals, led to onion prices moving into deflation during November 2020-January 2021. Onion prices picked up again in February 2021, however, due to drop in arrivals on account of unseasonal rainfall in January 2021 in Maharashtra. In the case of the third key vegetable, i.e., tomatoes, low arrivals from the key producing regions in Karnataka in October 2020. The production of pulses at 244 2020-21) is expected to augment the domestic improve (Chart II.12). Pulses inflation can thus be expected to moderate in the coming months, given the past relationship between production/stocks and prices8, although pressures may persist in some items like tur meat and fish also remained in double digits during most of 2020-21. It eased during November 2020 chicken from improved supplies and a decline in demand due to bird flu during January 2021. Prices of mutton and pork, however, remained high due to based food items. 8 The bumper harvests during 2016-17 and 2017-18 of 231 lakh tonnes and 254 lakh tonnes, respectively, and the consequent higher stock-use ratios coincided with record 29 consecutive months of deflation during December 2016 to April 2019. Prices of milk and products (weight of 6.6 per cent in the CPI and 14.4 per cent in the food and beverages group) remained muted in H2:2020-21, reflecting a quick restoration of supply chains of the well-established system of cooperatives amidst lower demand from the bulk segment. Prices of sugar and confectionery (weight of 1.4 per cent in the CPI and 3.0 per cent in the food and beverages group) eased during September 2020 - February 2021 on the back of expectations of a bumper crop and higher domestic production even as international sugar prices increased due to concerns over lower global availability in 2020-21.9 palm oil and soybean oil) resulted in oils and fats inflation peaking at around 20 per cent in December 2020-February 2021. The government reduced the basic customs duty (BCD) on crude palm oil from 37.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent effective November 27, 2020 and then revised it to 32.5 per cent [including the Agricultural Infrastructure Development Cess (AIDC)] effective February 2, 2021. Mustard oil and refined oil were the highest contributors to elevated edible oil inflation. Prices of oils and fats (weight of 3.6 per cent in the CPI and 7.8 per cent in the food and beverages group) remained one of the major pressure points throughout the year. Higher demand for mustard oil coupled (particularly with elevated Average retail price margins over wholesale prices increased across all the major sub-groups (cereals, vegetables, edible oils and pulses) during the post- lockdown period, pulling up headline inflation. The margins were higher in edible oils, vegetables and pulses than in the other two sub-groups (Chart II.11).11 9 Domestic sugar mills produced 278 lakh tonnes of sugar during 2021 sugar season (till March 31, 2021) as compared with 233 lakh tonnes in the corresponding period of the previous year. 10 International edible oil prices firmed up due to labour shortages in palm oil plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia, drought in Argentina affecting soybean production, and increased Chinese demand. 11 The analysis is based on daily price data on wholesale and retail prices from the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) for four major sub-groups \u2013 cereals, vegetables, edible oils and pulses \u2013 for January 2012 to December 2020 (excluding data for January-February 2021 due to changes in price collection mechanism and item varieties by DCA). The overall period has been divided into three phases, viz., pre-lockdown (January 2012 to February 2020), lockdown (March 2020 to May 2020) and post-lockdown (June 20 to December 2020). Item level retail and wholesale prices are aggregated at respective sub-group using item level CPI weights. Inflation in fuel prices initially moderated from 3.2 per cent in August 2020 to 1.6 per cent in November 2020, due to a decline in LPG and PDS kerosene prices and favourable base effects. Fuel inflation then increased to 3.5 per cent in February 2021, led by prices of LPG, kerosene and dung cake (Chart II.12a). The movements in LPG inflation largely reflected the lagged impact of international prices (Chart II.12b). PDS-kerosene prices were in deflation throughout 2020-21, as international prices to which they are linked have been below pre-COVID levels since April 2020 (Chart II.12c). CPI inflation excluding food and fuel, or core inflation, remained sticky and hovered between 5.4 per cent and 6.0 per cent during September 2020 to February 2021. Excluding petrol, diesel, gold and silver also, core inflation remained elevated (between 4.5 per cent and 5.1 per cent) over this period (Chart II.13). While the price build-up in the core categories was similar to the historical average, considerable variation was observed across subgroups: transport and communication, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, personal care and effects, health and recreation and amusement exhibited substantially Notes: (1) The international price for LPG is based on spot prices for Saudi Butane and Propane, combined in the ratio of 60:40 respectively.

(3) The domestic prices of LPG and kerosene represent the average prices of four and three metros, respectively, as reported by Indian Oil Corporation Limited higher build-up than the long-term average whereas clothing and footwear, housing, household goods and services and education exhibited subdued build-ups (Chart II.14). prices, along with the non-reversal of the substantial post-lockdown hike in excise duties and value added taxes (VATs), resulted in domestic petrol and diesel pump prices reaching historical highs by February 2021 (Chart II.15b). In H2:2020-21, crude oil prices (Indian basket) jumped by nearly 50 per cent \u2013 from around US$ 41 per barrel in September 2020 to US$ 61 per barrel in February 2021.

Core services inflation (weight of 23.0 per cent in CPI) rose from 4.0 per cent in August 2020 to 5.0 per cent in November 2020, primarily due to higher prices of recreation, education, transportation and communications services. Subsequently, core services inflation moderated to 4.3 per cent in January-February 2021 as inflation in prices of communication dropped sharply due to favourable base effects along with some moderation in education and recreation services inflation. Housing inflation, which primarily includes rental charges, at 3.2 per cent during November 2020 - February 2021 was lower than the pre-COVID levels; however, it was the second largest contributor to core services inflation (Chart II.17b). In sum, headline inflation dynamics in the post- lockdown period were primarily driven by goods inflation. Services inflation is the more durable component of the CPI and drives goods inflation over time (Box II.1). Cross-country evidence suggests that services inflation, on average, exceeds goods inflation due to a variety of bps. In the past too, there have been episodes of goods and services inflation exhibiting divergent patterns, as due to reduced competition and increased demand for CPI goods inflation excluding vegetables and gold and CPI services inflation (barring the period influenced by the statistical HRA12 impact), however, tend to show greater co-movement (Chart II.1.1). exceeded CPI services (weight of 23.4 per cent) inflation For India, the evidence suggests that prices of goods and substantially, with the gap increasing from 2.2 percentage services exhibit co-movement over time, i.e., the two series are cointegrated (Table II.1.1). This is consistent Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI.

The VECM analysis indicates a significant error correction (EC) term in CPI goods prices, while it was found to be insignificant in the case of CPI services prices. This suggests that following a shock resulting in a divergence from the long run equilibrium, it is goods prices that make the necessary adjustment to restore equilibrium. CPI goods prices are considerably influenced by the volatility induced by perishables such as vegetables and can result in divergences from CPI services prices over short periods. Services inflation, on the other hand, represents the relatively sticky component in the CPI basket and can spill over to goods inflation, resulting in generalised inflationary pressures.

Given the evidence of long-run cointegration, the short-run In addition to exclusion-based measures, trimmed means of inflation provide a measure of underlying inflation dynamics and are computed by statistically items with extremely positive and eliminating negative inflation. The trimmed mean indicators showed easing of inflation over the period under review in view of the omission of a few large outliers \u2013 such as vegetables, pulses, edible oils, transport fare, and pan, tobacco and intoxicants \u2013 in either direction. In contrast, exclusion-based measures, which capture persistent trends in inflation by eliminating ex-ante identified idiosyncratic and volatile components, suggest stickiness in inflation (Charts II.13 and II.18). Inflation measured by sectoral CPIs for agricultural (CPI- labourers (CPI-AL) and in RL) remained below headline CPI H2:2020-21. Lower inflation in food items along with their higher weight in CPI-AL and CPI-RL and subdued inflation in fuel, and clothing and footwear groups contributed to the relatively lower inflation prints for CPI-AL and CPI-RL. Inflation in terms of CPI for industrial workers (CPI-IW) though their gap narrowed. also remained below the headline CPI during H2.13 The price build-up in CPI-IW for clothing, housing and miscellaneous groups was lower relative 13 The Labour Bureau revised the base year of CPI for industrial workers (CPI-IW) from 2001 to 2016 in September 2020, based on the Working-Class Family Income & Expenditure Survey (WCFI&ES). The series covers 88 centres (78 in the earlier series), uses geometric mean for aggregation of price quotations (instead of arithmetic mean in the earlier series), and covers a larger number of items (463 items as against 392).

Inflation measured in terms of gross value added (GVA) and gross domestic product (GDP) deflators clocked a pick-up from Q1:2020-21 to Q3, broadly in alignment with WPI inflation. Within farm sector inputs, fodder price inflation remained elevated in double digits, during October 2020 to February 2021 due to the damage from excess rains during September-October 2020. Inflation in fertilisers remained muted in line with subdued cost of raw materials such as natural gas. Prices of electricity \u2013 a key constituent of both industrial and farm inputs \u2013 remained in deflation on an average during H2, barring a transient spike in November. Inflation in prices of agricultural machinery and implements recorded a modest increase during November 2020-February 2021. The measures of cost inflation \u2013 farm inputs and industrial raw materials derived from WPI \u2013 moved higher with the gradual unlocking of the economy, albeit with transient dips (Chart II.20). The firming up of global crude oil prices during H2:2020-21 impacted the prices of inputs such as high-speed diesel, naptha, aviation turbine fuel, and furnace oil. Minerals and non-food articles also generally rose during October 2020-February 2021. Prices of fibres emerged out of deflation in January 2021 in line with a pick-up in raw cotton and raw silk prices. Reflecting this, inflation in cotton yarn price registered sharp uptick. Nominal rural wages for both agricultural and non- agricultural labourers hardened during H1:2020-21, reflecting labour shortages during the lockdown period and the hike in wages by `20 under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREGA) scheme effective April 1, 2020. As the unlock phase progressed and labour availability improved, wage growth moderated in H2 although it remained higher than in the pre-lockdown period (Chart II.21). Growth in the value of production in Q3:2020- 21 for listed firms in the manufacturing and services sectors outpaced the rise in staff costs. As a result, unit labour costs (measured as a ratio of staff cost to value of production) decreased during Q3:2020-21, reverting towards pre-COVID levels. Unit labour costs moderated from 6.9 per cent in Q2:2020-21 to 6.4 per cent in Q3:2020-21 for firms in the manufacturing sector and from 31.4 per cent to 28.5 per cent respectively, for the services sector firms (Chart II.22). infrastructure Manufacturing, firms polled enterprise surveys15 reported an increase in salary outgo in Q4:2020-21, with expectations of a further rise in Q1:2021-22 as the level of employment is likely to gradually edge up. Input costs were also expected to intensify further in Q1 and continue in Q2 and Q3 of 2021-22 with the pace of increase moderating a tad for the manufacturing sector. The surveyed firms reported passing through the costs to their selling prices in Q4:2020-21. Selling prices are expected to gain further traction in Q1:2021-22 and remain firm in Q2 and Q3 for all the three sectors (Chart II.23). Manufacturing firms polled for the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) reported an increase in input prices in Q3:2020-21, with a further firming up in Q4 from higher costs of chemicals, metals, minerals, cotton and plastic; higher cost pressures were passed through to the clients resulting in an increase in selling prices. PMI services firms also reported continued increase in input prices in Q3 and Q4, driven by fuel, with the sharpest increase reported in prices of consumer services. Despite an increase in input costs, services sector firms reported lower selling prices in efforts to boost sales.

In 2020-21, inflation breached the upper tolerance band of 6 per cent for six consecutive months in the post-lockdown period (June-November 2020) due to a series of cost-push shocks \u2013 supply chain disruptions; weather shocks; higher crude oil and other commodity prices; and higher taxes. Inflationary pressures persisted despite a bumper kharif harvest. The increase in petrol and diesel prices is showing up in trade and transport costs, taxi and auto fares, and its second-round effects could push-up the prices of goods and services further in a broad-based manner, with firms regaining pricing power. Effective supply measures and tax rationalisation are critical to help anchor inflation expectations. If inflation remains close to the target on a durable basis, it can then provide monetary policy the space to adequately support the nascent recovery. After the unprecedented contraction in Q1, real gross domestic product (GDP) recorded sequential upturn in Q2 and regained positive territory in Q3 with the ambit of the recovery broadening to encompass a wider spectrum of sectors, supported by a significant decline in COVID-19 infections. The recent increase in COVID infections, if not contained, could push back the normalisation process and impede the broader revival of economic activity. Economic activity in India in H2:2020-21 turned out to be more resilient than anticipated in the October 2020 MPR, supported by a significant decline in new COVID-19 infections from the mid-September 2020 peak and the rollout of the vaccination drive from mid- January 2021. After the unprecedented contraction in Q1, real gross domestic product (GDP) recorded sequential upturn in Q2 and regained positive territory in Q3 with the ambit of the recovery broadening to encompass a wider spectrum of sectors since then. On the supply side too, the sustained resilience of agriculture and allied activities was complemented by manufacturing and services sector activity gaining some momentum. As a result, real gross value added (GVA) recorded positive growth in Q3 and is expected to be positive in Q4 also. Real GDP contracted by 8.0 per cent in 2020-21, according to the National Statistical Office\u2019s (NSO) second advance estimates (SAE), although some slack can be attributed to on-budgeting of past subsidy payments in Q4 (Chart III.1a and Table III.1). The recovery in H2:2020-21 was on the back of revival in government expenditure and fixed investment and easing of the contraction in private consumption. Quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted annualised (qoq-SAAR) growth rates, however, moderated in Q3 Note: 1. # - Implicit growth. 2. SAAR \u2013 Seasonally adjusted annualised rate.

Private final consumption expenditure Government final consumption expenditure Gross fixed capital formation Exports Imports GDP at market prices and Q4 suggesting some flattening of momentum (Chart III.1b). The October 2020 Monetary Policy Report (MPR) projected GDP growth at (-) 9.8 per cent for Q2:2020- 21, (-) 5.6 per cent for Q3 and 0.5 per cent for Q4, with risks tilted to the downside. Actual outcomes in terms of the NSO\u2019s SAE overshot these projections by 250 and 600 basis points in Q2 and Q3, respectively (Chart III.2), which may be largely attributed to faster than anticipated reduction in new COVID-19 infections in the country. The upside surprise in Q2 and Q3 largely stemmed from a better-than-expected performance in gross fixed capital formation. Data for Q4:2020-21 are expected on May 31, 2021. Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) \u2013 the mainstay of aggregate demand, severely dented during the pandemic \u2013 revived in H2:2020-21 as spending expanded from essential commodities and services towards discretionary items on the back of gradual relaxation of restrictions. The contraction in real PFCE moderated to 2.4 per cent in Q3 from 11.3 per cent in Q2. Spending on transport, hotels and restaurants, recreation and culture, which together contribute around 20 per cent to PFCE, also began improving in Q4. Several high frequency indicators of private consumption crossed pre-COVID levels, attesting to a broad-based momentum. Drilling down further reveals a divergence between urban and rural demand, with the former suffering the maximum damage and taking longer time to recover due to the loss of employment and heightened uncertainty. Some coincident and proximate high frequency indicators show that urban consumption started inching up from Q3:2020-21 and gained further strength in Q4 with the easing of restrictions. Passenger vehicle sales remained robust since August and posted double-digit growth in January and February 2021, partly reflecting shifting of preferences towards own vehicles over public transportation in the wake of the pandemic. The production of consumer durables, that had collapsed during H1, got revitalised and surpassed pre-COVID levels in December 2020 (Chart III.3a). Credit card outstanding and other personal loans, however, remained subdued (Chart III.3b). Domestic air passenger traffic, is still tepid and around two- third of pre-COVID-19 levels, reflecting lackluster activity related to tourism and entertainment, and with business meetings increasingly preferring the virtual mode. remained in expansion zone since August 2020 (Chart III.4). The consumer non-durables output witnessed expansion in December 2020, before contracting in January 2021. Unemployment rates in both rural and urban areas recorded declines during H2 and supported private consumption. The labour force participation rate improved considerably in H2 vis-\u00e0-vis H1 but remains Rural consumption recouped quickly and remained resilient on the back of record kharif production, sustained the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), and cash transfers under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana and other schemes. The households that sought employment under the MGNREGA scheme were 63 per cent higher in Q3:2020-21 and remained elevated in Q4. Indicators of rural demand \u2013 improved rabi acreage during fertilisers; and 2020-21; higher production of accelerated tractor sales during November-February \u2013 augur well for a brighter outlook. Motorcycle sales have below pre-COVID levels. Nonetheless, the available data from different sources indicate that employment conditions have in H2 (Chart III.5). improved considerably The upturn in fixed investment gained traction during H2:2020-21, although it continues to be weighed down by surplus capacity and uncertainty surrounding the outlook. Congenial financial conditions are expected to continue supporting the recovery in fixed investment (Box III.1). Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by 2.6 per cent on year-on-year basis in Q3 and is estimated to rise by 2.8 per cent in Q4. For the full year 2020-21, GFCF is estimated to have contracted by 12.4 per cent, given the sharp downturn in H1. The share of GFCF in aggregate GDP inched up to 32.8 per cent in H2 from 28.5 per cent in H1 and 31.9 per cent in H2:2019-20. Real estate and construction activity gained some momentum from Q3 \u2013 particularly in rural and semi-urban areas and affordable segments in urban areas \u2013 benefitting from lower mortgage rates, favourable pricing and a slash in stamp duty across several states. Among its proximate coincident indicators, steel consumption rose at a robust pace in January and February 2021 on top of double-digit growth in the preceding two months. Investment in machinery and equipment is Domestic financial conditions eased considerably with the onset of the pandemic as reflected in large drops in interest rates/spreads across the spectrum and ample surplus liquidity in the system on the back of conventional and unconventional policy measures by the Reserve Bank. The availability and cost of finance are amongst the important drivers of investment. A financial condition index (FCI) that is a summary indicator of financial conditions, helps to gauge their impact on investment activity. Following Kongsamut et. al. (2017), a FCI for India is constructed with variables drawn from equity, debt, money and forex markets. Using data from Q1:2002 to Q1:2020, the FCI includes the following five standardised variables \u2013 government securities (G-Sec) 10-year benchmark yield, corporate AAA bond spread over G-Sec yield, Nifty-50 return, repo rate and net foreign portfolio inflows \u2013 based on a preliminary analysis of their correlation and impact on investment. Dynamic factor model (DFM)1 and vector auto regression (VAR)2 approaches are used to construct FCIs (FCI1 and FCI2, respectively) for a robust analysis. Negative values of FCIs denote easier financial conditions while positive values indicate tighter financial conditions. Both the FCIs exhibit broadly similar directional changes (Chart III.1.2). The FCIs capture the tightening of financial conditions during the global financial crisis in 2008 and later in 2012-13 (associated with the period of high inflation and monetary tightening) as well as the recent easing of financial conditions after the pandemic. In terms of the DFM-based FCI, financial conditions at present are at their easiest since 2003. Both the measures of FCIs are negatively correlated (statistically significant) with growth in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and the correlation is higher for lagged FCI, i.e., the easing of financial conditions is associated with a subsequent rise in investment growth (Table III.I.1). Granger causality tests confirm that the 1 DFM is applied as dimension reduction technique using factor analyser module of Python. Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity indicates that the dataset is not an identity matrix; Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy is found to be greater than 0.6. The maximum likelihood (ML) method is used to fit factors to the observed data with visual scree plot analysis to decide on using 2 factors. 2 The VAR model is run on the same set of variables and the weights are derived from impulse response functions as cumulative impact on investment in 8 subsequent quarters to construct FCI2.

The role of financial conditions in supporting investment activity is also corroborated by regression analysis with controls for expected economic activity (Table III.I.3). also recovering as reflected by imports of capital goods remaining in the positive zone since December 2020 (Chart III.6a). The production of capital goods attained positive territory in December 2020 but shrank in January 2021. The capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector improved to 66.6 per cent in Q3 from the previous quarter (Chart III.6b). Seasonally adjusted CU also increased to 65.2 per cent in Q3 from 64.4 per cent in the previous quarter. Half-yearly unaudited financial statements of listed non-government non-financial (NGNF) companies indicate that companies reduced their assets and used funds to reduce liabilities and build-up cash holdings \u2013 the former signifying deleveraging while the latter is indicative of precautionary saving in uncertain times. The debt to equity ratio of these firms dropped by 4.4 percentage points to 39.7 per cent in H1:2020-21, although it was still higher than its level in the previous two years. Investment by these companies remained subdued (Table III.2). At the same time, the interest coverage ratio of listed non- financial private companies increased in Q3, indicating improved debt servicing capacity of these companies (Chart III.7). The deleveraging and improved debt service capacity along with congenial financial conditions, capacity utilisation, in the resuscitation of private consumption and expanded scope of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme offer a conducive environment for capex spending by non-financial private companies. Bank lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) segment has improved with increased Note: Based on data of 1,249 common listed private manufacturing companies.

As on February 28, 2021, the utilisation under ECLGS stood at 82 per cent. The PLI, covering 13 sectors with a commitment of the government support amounting to nearly `1.97 lakh crore, has begun attracting investment, including FDI, in the manufacturing sector. The significantly higher allocation for capital expenditure in the Union Budget 2021-22 is expected to crowd in private investment, and hence, augurs well for the revival of the private sector investment cycle. At the same time, possible stress in the balance sheet of banks \u2013 once special dispensations related to moratorium, asset classification and restructuring wane \u2013 could weigh on the investment outlook. Capital infusion and efficient and effective handling of loan delinquencies should be accorded priority, so that impediment to credit availability does not undermine revival in the investment cycle. As per the first revised estimates for 2019-20, the gross domestic saving rate increased to 31.4 per cent of GDP from 30.6 per cent a year ago. Net household financial Per cent to GDP a. Tax revenue (Net) b. Non-Tax revenue 2. Non-debt capital receipts 3. Revenue expenditure saving \u2013 a major source of funds for the economy \u2013 increased to 8.0 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 from 7.2 per cent in the preceding year. While the public sector was reliant on household surpluses for financing its deficit, the private sector depended primarily on internal resources for financing its investment needs (Chart III.8). According to preliminary estimates, the household financial savings rate spiked to 21.0 per in H2. Excluding government expenditure, the economy would have recorded a contraction of 9.3 per cent in 2020-21. In 2021-22, the growth in revenue expenditure excluding interest and subsidy payments has been budgeted at 4.8 per cent, considerably on the lower side as compared with 13.1 per cent in 2020-21 (RE), indicating lower support to aggregate demand (Table III.3). cent of GDP in Q1:2020-21 as consumption waned amidst lockdowns and nearly normalised back to 10.4 per cent in Q2 as consumption recovered reinforced by pent-up demand3. Expenditure (GFCE) narrowed sharply from 24.0 per cent during Q2 to 1.1 per cent in Q3. GFCE support to aggregate demand revived in Q4 (the implicit growth in the SAE of NSO is 29.2 per cent). Overall, the fiscal During 2020-21, the fiscal position of the central government remained under stress due to revenue in COVID-19-related shortfalls discretionary spending. Revenue collections gathered pace in H2, however, on the back of the pick-up in economic activity. The centre\u2019s net tax revenue increased by 9.1 per cent during April-February 2020-21 and stood at 90.4 per cent of revised estimates (RE) for the full year (Chart III.9). Except excise and customs duties, tax collections witnessed declines across the board. support to aggregate demand remained substantial Total GST collections were severely hit by the lockdown during H1:2020-21 but crossed the previous year\u2019s level from September 2020 onwards (Chart III.10). In March 2021, GST collections were recorded at `1.24 lakh crore. Direct tax collections during April-February 2020-21 were 81.6 per cent of RE, down by 9.9 per cent over the previous year\u2019s level. Total tax revenue is budgeted to be higher in 2021-22 than in the previous year (Table III.4). The revenue expenditure for the full year 2020-21 was revised upward by 14.5 per cent from the BE, mainly due to spending on major subsides. Outgoes on food subsidy in RE were over three and half times of the BE (2.2 per cent of GDP) because of distribution of free foodgrains to over 80 crore people and on-budgeting of past subsidy payments to the Food Corporation of India Per cent to GDP (i) Corporation (ii) Income 2.

The revenue expenditure, excluding interest and subsidy payments, is estimated to step-up by 33.6 per cent in Q4 (Chart III.11). The capital expenditure of the central government also inched up by 6.6 per cent in RE 2020-21 from BE on the back of higher spending on central sector schemes, railways, defence, transfers to the States, health and MSMEs. Higher capital expenditure in RE that is attributed to discretionary spending gave a thrust to fixed investment in the economy. The increased government expenditure reflects the fiscal policy push necessitated by the pandemic to save lives and livelihood and nurture the economic recovery. Reflecting decline in revenues and higher expenditures, the fiscal deficit (FD) and revenue deficit (RD) edged up considerably to 9.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent of GDP, respectively in 2020-21(RE). The Union Budget 2021-22 gave an impetus to growth through increased outlays for capital expenditure. Although total expenditure is budgeted to grow by only 1 per cent, the increased focus on capital expenditure that has multiplier effects would boost overall investment and growth in the economy. The allocation for capital expenditure has been budgeted higher by 26.2 per cent, while revenue expenditure is budgeted to fall by 2.7 per cent in 2021-22. The capital outlay (i.e., capital expenditure excluding loans and advances) is budgeted to edge up to 2.3 per cent of GDP in 2021-22 (BE) from 1.7 per cent in 2020-21(RE) (Chart III.12). The Union Budget 2021-22 expected the fiscal deficit (FD) to decline to 6.8 per cent of GDP and to 4.5 per cent by 2025-26. Based on data for 24 states for April-January 2020- 21, states\u2019 consolidated revenue receipts contracted largely due to downturn in own tax revenue, central tax transfer and own non-tax revenue. Consolidated revenue receipts, however, made a turnaround in H2 (October-January 2020-21) due to revival in GST collections. Despite COVID-19 related spending, states\u2019 revenue expenditure interest payments and subsidies) rose marginally during April- January due to expenditure rationalisation. Capital expenditure after contracting in H1, posted a robust growth in H2 (October-January 2020-21), reflecting a qualitative improvement in expenditure composition. For 2021-22, the consolidated GFD (for 12 states for which data are available) is budgeted at 3.7 per cent of (excluding Territories that have presented their Budgets for 2021-22. The Reserve Bank of India completed the central government\u2019s market borrowing programme for 2020-21 successfully and in a non-disruptive manner (Table III.6). Despite a sharp increase in the quantum of the borrowings, ample surplus liquidity, regular open market operations (OMO) including special OMOs, regulatory measures and forward guidance enabled the government to complete its borrowings at a 16- year low weighted average cost \u2013 5.79 per cent during 2020-21 as compared with 6.84 per cent in 2019-20 \u2013 along with the highest weighted average maturity. States\u2019 gross borrowings of `7.98 lakh crore, also significantly higher than normal, were completed at a weighted average cost of 6.52 per cent during 2020-21. Eleven tranches of switch operations amounting to `1.53 lakh crore were undertaken during 2020- 21, aiming at managing rollover risk and enhancing liquidity of government securities. The Union Budget 2021-22 has placed net market borrowings through G-Sec at `9.2 lakh crore, lower than in 2020-21 (RE). Market borrowings are slated to finance 61 per cent of the centre\u2019s fiscal deficit in 2021-22(BE), higher than 57 per cent in RE 2020- 21 (Chart III.13). Gross market borrowings of the central government through dated securities have been planned at `7.24 lakh crore in H1:2021-22 (60 per cent of the total budgeted amount for 2021-22). The ways and means advances (WMA) limit for the central government has been fixed at `1.20 lakh crore for H1:2021-22 to enable seamless bridging of intermittent mismatch between receipts and payments on account of leads and lags. With the global economy gradually emerging from one of its deepest recessions, India\u2019s exports surpassed the pre-pandemic level and entered the expansionary zone from December 2020. Imports contraction became softer in H2:2020-21 and eventually turned positive from December 2020 after a gap of 9 months (Chart III.14). The positive contribution of net external demand to y-o-y growth fell in Q3 with improvement in imports outpacing exports. The contribution of net external demand to growth is estimated to improve in Q4. According to data released by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S), the pace of contraction in India\u2019s merchandise exports, which peaked in Q1:2020-21 due to the disruptions caused by the COVID-19, moderated in Q2 and Q3 on the back of a gradual recovery in global demand conditions. Merchandise exports expanded for the third month in a row in February 2021 (Chart III.15 a). Non-oil exports rose by 3.1 per cent in Q3 and 7.5 per cent during January-February 2021 (Chart III.15c). At the disaggregated level, drugs and pharmaceuticals, iron ore and agricultural products pushed up non-oil export growth. Overall, during April-February 2020-21, merchandise exports contracted by 12.2 per cent. in merchandise imports moderated to 4.7 per cent in Q3:2020-21 from 52.9 per cent in Q1 (Chart III.15b). In February 2021, merchandise imports rose by 7.0 per cent, registering an expansion for the third consecutive month. The rebound in non-oil non-gold imports has been broad-based, with major sectors including electronic goods, machinery, chemicals, and pearls and precious stones reaching pre-COVID levels in December 2020 (Chart III.15d). Gold imports rose by 38.0 per cent in Q3 and 124 per cent in February 2021. Overall, merchandise imports contracted by 23.1 per cent in April-February 2020-21. With imports contracting faster than exports, the merchandise trade deficit nearly halved to US$ 84.6 billion in April-February 2020-21 from US$151.4 billion in the corresponding period a year ago. Going forward, India\u2019s oil import bill may edge up due to the rise in international crude oil prices since November 2020 in the face of rebalancing of global oil supply-demand conditions. Turning to the services sector, the initial setback to the exports of services in Q1:2020-21 waned gradually in view of the resilience of software exports (Chart III.16). While travel and transport sector and Note: *:H2: October-February 2020-21. Sources: DGCI&S and RBI staff estimates. impacted trade-related services were adversely due to the global lockdown restrictions, domestic information technology (IT) companies benefitted from demand from international customers and increasingly adopted new models for IT and other work operations in the wake of the pandemic. Remittances recorded sequential improvement in Q2 and Q3 with the phased normalisation of global economic activity. While the current account surplus was 3.0 per cent of GDP in H1, the rising trade deficit pushed the current account back into deficit in Q3. Net capital flows remained robust in 2020-21 supported by foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio (FPI) on growing investment optimism about India\u2019s growth prospects. Driven primarily by megadeals in the digital and retail sectors, net FDI at US$ 44.3 billion during April- January 2020-21 was higher than US$ 36.3 billion a year ago. The sharp upturn in net purchases by portfolio investors in the equity segment during H2 resulted in net FPI inflows at US$ 37.1 billion during 2020-21 (up to March 30) as against an outflow of US$ 5.2 billion during the same period last year (Chart III.17). While the accommodative monetary policies of major central banks improved the appetite for risk among global portfolio investors, robust earnings reported by domestic corporate sector, positive sentiments on COVID vaccination and optimism on domestic growth also helped in attracting record FPI inflows. Despite purchases by FPIs in the debt market in H2:2020-21, there was a cumulative net outflow at US$ 0.5 billion from this segment in 2020-21 (up to March 30). External commercial borrowings recorded net outflows during April-January 2020 partly due to pre-payments. Net flows under non-resident deposits, however, surged during the period. As on March 26, 2021, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves amounted to US$ 579.3 billion, covering 18.4 months of imports and 102.8 per cent of external debt (chart III.17). Gross value added (GVA) \u2013 the measure of aggregate supply \u2013 contracted by 6.5 per cent in 2020-21 as per the SAE released by the NSO. GVA posted a growth of 1.8 per cent in H2:2020-21 in contrast to a downturn of 14.9 per cent in H1:2020-21. The momentum in growth \u2013 Q-o-Q-SAAR \u2013 eased during Q3 and Q4 from Q2 (Chart III.18). Agriculture, forestry and fishing Industry Mining and quarrying Manufacturing Electricity, gas, water supply and other utilities Services Construction Trade, hotels, transport, communication Financial, real estate and professional services Public administration, defence and other services GVA at basic prices remained Agriculture and offsetting resilient during the contraction in other components of GVA. Manufacturing activity entered expansion in Q3 but dipped back into contraction in January 2021. The services sector \u2013 battered by the pandemic \u2013 tenuously regained momentum in H2, buoyed by optimism on the roll-out of vaccines (Table III.7). Allied activities consisting of livestock, forestry and fishing \u2013 which constitute about 44 per cent of the GVA in agriculture and allied activities expanded by 3.0 per cent in H2:2020-21, maintaining its pace of H1. Sufficient access to inputs, adequate and well- spread south-west and the north-east monsoon rains, sufficient reservoir levels and improved soil moisture pushed up rabi acreage by 2.9 per cent. The SAE for 2020-21 has placed kharif and rabi foodgrains production higher by 2.9 and 1.1 per cent, respectively, over their levels a year ago (Table III.8). Foodgrains production, including both the staple cereals, viz., rice and wheat, touched another record for the fifth consecutive year. Among the commercial crops, cotton and oilseeds (groundnut and \u2018rapeseed and mustard\u2019) achieved record production levels. All the crops, except pulses and jute and mesta, achieved their target levels for 2020-21. Horticultural production was also placed #: lakh bales of 170 kgs. each. ##: lakh bales of 180 kgs. each.

Record procurement of cereals led to a significantly higher buffer stock of wheat and rice at 286.8 lakh tonnes (2.1 times the buffer norms) and 512.4 lakh tonnes (6.7 times the buffer norms), respectively, by mid-March 2020 notwithstanding 315 lakh tonnes of cereals distributed under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (Chart III.20). In terms of high frequency indicators, tractor sales posted strong growth in Q3 and January-February 2021, and two-wheeler sales remained buoyant (Table III.9). Farm exports remained strong during Q3 and Q4 (January-February), benefitting from a surge in global demand and higher international food prices. sector \u2013 contributed about half of overall agricultural GVA growth in 2019-20 (Chart III.19). The procurement of paddy during the kharif marketing season that started in September 2020 was higher by 14.0 per cent year-on-year till March 31, 2021. For upcoming rabi marketing season (April- March), the government has set a target to procure 407.0 lakh tonnes of wheat, which is 2.3 per cent The Union Budget 2021-22 has announced measures targeted at infrastructure development in agriculture, rural areas, and fisheries by enhancing credit flow and improving supply chains for perishables while ensuring continuation of direct procurement of cereals by the government.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US, there is around 60 per cent chance of a transition from La Ni\u00f1a to ENSO-Neutral during the April-June 2021, indicative of a normal south west monsoon. The index of industrial production (IIP) emerged out of a prolonged contraction in September 2020 but it lost momentum again in November and January 2021 (Chart III.22a). The improvement in manufacturing activity in Q3 was driven by basic metals, chemical and chemical products, motor vehicles and electrical equipment. 12 out of 23 industry groups entered positive territory in Q3 as compared to only 5 groups during Q2. In terms of the use-based classification, the recovery in Q3 was led by consumer durables and infrastructure/construction goods on the back of Industrial sector GVA was driven by the manufacturing sector emerging out of contraction in Q3, although in Q4, there has been some setback due to sharp retrenchment of production of capital goods and consumer non-durables (Chart III.21). In contrast, the mining sector continued to languish, throttled by supply bottlenecks. Crude oil and natural gas production dropped due to lack of critical infrastructure and equipment, and operational difficulties amidst the pandemic. Natural gas production crossed the pre- COVID levels in January 2021 following the start of production in KG-D6 field, which bodes well for the outlook. 4 National Agriculture Market (eNAM) is a pan-India electronic trading portal which networks the APMC mandis to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities. goods sector, the moderation was offset by higher In January 2021, the IIP contracted by 1.6 per cent, pulled down by the downturn in manufacturing. Mining activity contracted further in January 2021. production declined to a 5-month low while consumer some deceleration in February 2021. The thermal sector contributed primarily to the upturn in electricity generation in Q3 and January with a growth of 7.6 per cent and 7.0 per cent, respectively, before easing to 1.9 per cent in February 2021. The rate of contraction in nuclear power generation became more pronounced January-February 2021, while generation during from renewable sources decelerated in January and contracted in February (Chart III.23a). Hydro power generation continued to contract in Q3 and January- February 2021. The deceleration in electricity demand in February was mainly due to a drop in consumption in western and southern regions (Chart III.23b). non-durables output fell to an 8-month low. Electricity generation improved in Q3 and January 2021 reflecting buoyant demand although there was Nominal GVA of manufacturing companies posted a notable improvement in Q3 on the back of strong growth in profits (Chart III.24). Profit before tax of manufacturing companies surged on an improvement in net sales coupled with reduced interest expenses. Employee cost posted an uptick, however. Business sentiment improved in H2:2020-21, with rising to 113.1 in Q4:20-21 (the 93rd round of the The business expectations index (BEI) also improved further to 119.6 for Q1:2021-22 as compared to 114.1 managers\u2019 index (PMI) at 55.4 in March 2021 indicated driven by upturn in new orders and production generation are gradually normalising and approaching The services sector stepped out of contraction Note: Data for Q3:2020-21 are based on results of 1,685 listed private manufacturing companies.

The construction sector recuperated faster than anticipated \u2013 entering positive territory in Q3 \u2013 and rose by 7.3 per cent in H2 due to demand from the residential sector and highway construction (Chart III.26a). Indicators such as finished steel consumption mirrored the recovery in construction activity (Chart III.26b). Robust collection of the goods and services tax (GST) and issuances of e-way bills suggest a strong upturn in domestic trading activity.

Growing demand for core transformation services5 and strong revenue conversion from earlier deals, coupled with low travel cost, supported IT companies during Q3. Sales of non-IT services companies remained in contraction zone in Q3, albeit with some moderation. Commercial vehicle sales \u2013 an indicator of transportation services \u2013 posted a sequential improvement in Q3:2020-21, with the pace of contraction moderating to 1.2 per cent from 20.1 per cent in Q2. Other indicators of transportation services \u2013 toll collections; rail freight traffic; and cargo handled by major ports \u2013 displayed expansion. Air passengers and cargo traffic \u2013 both domestic and international \u2013 remained in contractionary zone, despite some pick- up. Domestic flights are witnessing some momentum In H2, public administration, defence and other services (PADO) expanded marginally from the contraction in H1, driven by government revenue expenditure on public administration. Other services in PADO \u2013 private education; health; personal services; and cultural and recreational activities \u2013 continued to be tepid. Growth in central government revenue interest payments and expenditure, excluding subsidies, recovered in Q3 and strengthened further in Q4. GVA in financial, real estate and professional services rebounded and expanded by 6.8 per cent in H2, reflecting the strong performance of information technology and financial companies. Accelerated growth in aggregate deposits and the improvement in bank credit extended support to financial services during H2. The real estate sector gained steam from Q3, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas and affordable segments in urban areas, on the back of lower mortgage rates, favourable pricing and slash in stamp duty across several states. In residential real estate, new launches registered y-o-y growth for the first time in eight quarters during Q3:2020-21 while the inventory overhang moderated to an average of 55 months in Q3 from 73 months in Q2 (Chart III.28a). Growth in the RBI\u2019s all-India housing price index remained unchanged in Q3 from the previous quarter (Chart III.28b). 5 Cloud services, analytics and insights, cognitive business operations, internet of things (IoT) and quality engineering and transformation platform services led growth in the quarter. to enhance India\u2019s manufacturing capabilities and Economic activity in India is gathering pace on improving business sentiment. Rural demand is leading the expansion, and there is growing evidence of catch-up in urban demand. The fiscal stimulus under AatmaNirbhar 2.0 and 3.0, coupled with increased allocation for capital expenditure under the Union Budget 2021-22, should accelerate public investment and crowd in private investment. The production-linked incentives scheme is expected bolster exports. Despite gaining some traction, the contact-intensive services sector may take some time to reach pre-COVID levels. The recent increase in COVID infections, if not contained, could push back the normalisation process and impede the broader revival of economic activity. The sharp rise financial market volatility impart downside risks to During H2:2020-21, domestic financial markets continued to post recovery in market activity amidst easy liquidity conditions. Nevertheless, concerns about a surge in infections in a few states, global bond sell-off, the large government borrowing, and uncertainty about the pace and scale of economic recovery kept market sentiments subdued. The pace of monetary transmission improved while bank credit growth registered an upturn. Going forward, the RBI\u2019s market operations would ensure ample surplus liquidity in consonance with the accommodative policy stance to revive growth on a durable basis by mitigating the impact of COVID-19. In H2:2020-21, global financial markets remained largely buoyant, fuelled by optimism around a inflation speedy vaccine-led recovery. Growing concerns over fiscal stimulus amidst extremely accommodative monetary policies rattled global bond markets in February 2021. Long-term sovereign bond yields jumped sharply in the US and induced bouts of volatility across financial markets and regions of the world. The consequent yield curve steepening resulted in portfolio reallocation and corrections in equity prices. Despite the recent declines, stock indices remain elevated on anticipation of stronger recovery. In the currency markets, the US dollar appreciated in the first quarter of 2021 driven by rising bond yields while EME currencies faced depreciation pressures from bouts of capital outflows. The weighted average call rate (WACR) in the unsecured overnight money market eased and slipped below the reverse repo rate, beginning the second half of October 2020 (Chart IV.1). The negative spread of WACR relative to the reverse repo rate averaged 14 bps in H2. In the overnight call money segment, the weighted average rate (WAR) of traded deals generally remained above the reverse repo rate while that of reported deals remained below1. The share of the reported deals in During H2:2020-21, domestic financial markets continued to post recovery in market activity amidst easy liquidity conditions. Nevertheless, concerns about a surge in infections in a few states, global bond sell-off, the large government borrowing and uncertainty about the pace and scale of economic recovery kept market sentiments subdued. The money market remained largely stable during H2:2020-21, reflecting surplus liquidity conditions. 1 \u2018Traded deals\u2019 are deals negotiated directly on the NDS-Call platform whereas \u2018reported deals\u2019 are over-the-counter (OTC) deals which are reported on the NDS-Call platform after the completion of negotiation of deals. the total volume of the call money segment increased to 54 per cent in H2:2020-21 from 46 per cent in H1, thereby pulling down the WACR below the reverse repo rate (Chart IV.2). The increased share of reported deals reflected the sharp increase in lending share of co-operative banks from 60 per cent in October to 79 per cent in November and the concomitant reduction in the borrowing share of public sector banks (PSBs) from 26 per cent to 1.0 per cent during the same period. (private sector) banks in both triparty and market repo segments \u2013 the share of public sector banks increased from 14 per cent in October 2020 to 56 per cent in March 2021 in the triparty repo and from 10 per cent to 17 per cent in market repo segment over the same period \u2013 as these segments provide access to funds from mutual funds. Moreover, the share of mutual funds in triparty repo lending increased from 61 per cent in October 2020 to 68 per cent in March 2021. The share of the collateralised money market (triparty repo and market repo) in the overnight money market volume increased further to 97 per cent in H2: 2020- 21 from 95 per cent in H2: 2019-20 (Chart IV.3). Within the secured segment, the share of triparty repo in the overnight money market volume increased due to ramped-up lending by mutual funds in this segment. The combined volume in the overnight and term segments of the triparty repo market expanded sharply during H2:2020-21 \u2013 daily average volume increased from `1.67 lakh crore in October 2020 to `2.67 lakh crore in March 2021. There was a sharp increase (decrease) in the share of borrowing by public sector The rates in the secured overnight segments remained consistently below the WACR and the reverse repo rate (Chart IV.4), impelled by the surplus liquidity conditions, as alluded to earlier. Following the reactivation of the 14-day variable rate reverse repo auctions in mid-January 2021 with the resumption of normal liquidity management operations, money market rates and their spreads from the WACR firmed up somewhat from end- January 2021 (Table IV.1).

CP rates generally traded above the average discount rate (WADR) was observed in to increased issuances by non-banking financial During H2: 2020-21, the 10-year G-sec yield firmed up by 30 bps, although it remained at decadal low levels. During Q3:2020-21, the yield softened by 15 bps from 6.04 per cent to 5.89 per cent, aided by policy rates also traded below the reverse repo rate, on an average, by 16 bps and 9 bps, respectively. Interest rates on CDs and commercial papers (CPs), however, inched up above the reverse repo rate in March 2021. Reflecting the surplus system liquidity and weak credit demand, banks reduced their recourse to CDs. As a result, fresh issuance of CDs declined to `53,468 crore during H2:2020-21 (up to March 12, 2021) from `1.69 lakh crore in the corresponding period of 2019-20. CP issuances declined moderately (ii) extended dispensation of enhanced held to guidance on maintaining accommodative monetary policy stance as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis. The extent of softening, however, was limited over concerns about large supply of bonds `1.1 lakh crore by the Central Government to fund the shortfall in GST compensation for states. During Q4, yields remained range bound with an upward bias till the presentation of the Union Budget 2021-22 on February 1, 2021 (Chart IV.6). the announcement of Yields spiked following for 2020-21. Yields subsequently eased somewhat 2021 at lower than the market\u2019s expected cut-offs; (ii) extension of the dispensation of enhanced HTM limit of 22 per cent of NDTL up to March 31, 2023; and (iii) forward guidance by the RBI on ensuring ample liquidity to foster congenial financing conditions. Yields firmed up from the second half of February in the wake of the sharp rise in US treasury yields and higher crude oil prices. The cancellation of the last scheduled G-sec auction for 2020-21 resulted in some moderation in yields towards end-March. Yields on treasury bills across maturities traded below the policy repo rate as systemic liquidity continued to remain in large surplus (Chart IV.7). The average level of the yield curve increased by 19 bps in H2:2020-21 and the slope steepened by 5 bps3 (Chart IV.8). The slope dynamics reflect larger rise in long term yields compared with the short term, the latter driven by the large systemic liquidity surplus in consonance with the accommodative monetary policy stance. The weighted average spread of cut-off yields on SDLs over G-sec yields of corresponding maturities was 53 bps during H2, same as in H1:2020-21 (Chart IV.9). The spread widened post the Union Budget announcement of February 1, 2021 but narrowed substantially in end-March 2021 following the cancellation of the last G-sec auction. The average inter-state spread on securities of 10-year maturity 3 While the level is the average of par yields of all tenors up to 30-years published by FBIL, the slope (term spread) is the difference in par yields of 3-months and 30-years maturities. 11.31 years as at end-March 2021 from 10.97 years as at end-September 2020. The weighted average coupon (WAC) at 7.27 per cent was lower than 7.44 per cent over the same period. During H2:2020-21, corporate bond yields remained almost unchanged. Yields on AAA-rated 3-year bonds issued by NBFCs softened by 1 basis point to 5.54 per cent, while those on corporates and public-sector undertakings (PSUs), financial institutions (FIs) and banks hardened by 5 bps and 11 bps to 5.40 per cent and 5.20 per cent, respectively, at end-March 2021 (Chart IV.10a). The risk premium or spread on AAA- rated 3-year bonds (over 3-year G-sec) moderated from 63 bps to 36 bps for NBFCs, 43 bps to 22 bps for corporates and 17 bps to 2 bps for PSUs, FIs and banks (Chart IV.10b). (fresh issuance) was 11 bps in H2 as compared with 9 bps in H1:2020-21. In order to facilitate debt consolidation, the Reserve Bank conducted six switch operations on behalf of the central government amounting to `77,371 crore during H2:2020-21. The weighted average maturity (WAM) of the outstanding stock of G-secs increased to Resource mobilisation through issuances of corporate bonds in the primary market at `3.06 lakh crore during H2:2020-21 (up to February 2021) was marginally lower than `3.08 lakh crore during the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart IV.11a). Almost the entire resource mobilisation in the corporate bond market (97.3 per cent) was through the private placement route. Outstanding investments by FPIs in corporate bonds declined to `1.3 lakh crore at end- March 2021 from `1.5 lakh crore at end-September 2020. Consequently, foreign portfolio invenstors (FPIs\u2019) utilisation of the approved limit for investment in corporate bonds declined to 23.1 per cent at end- March 2021 from 33.8 per cent at end-September 2020. The daily average secondary market trading volume in the corporate bond market declined by 26.4 per cent to `6,084 crore during H2:2020-21 (up to February 2021) over the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart IV.11b). Between March 26, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the spread of AAA-rated 3-year bonds (over 3-year G-sec) issued by corporates fell from 276 bps to 22 bps. The spreads on BBB- (BBB minus) bonds \u2013 the lowest rated investment grade corporate bonds \u2013 also moderated significantly by 171 bps over the same period (Table IV.2). The market perception of credit risk has also improved: State Bank of India\u2019s and ICICI Bank\u2019s 3-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads reduced by 11 bps each during H2:2020-21. Domestic equities scaled all-time highs in H2:2020-21 on positive global cues, record FPI inflows, revival in economic activity, robust corporate earnings, roll-out of COVID-19 vaccine and announcement of a growth- Spread in bps (over corresponding risk-free rate) oriented Union Budget 2021-22.

The benchmark index closed above 50000 for the first time on February 3, 2021 and scaled an all-time high The Indian equity market remained upbeat in October 2020 following the phased unlocking of the economy, Q2 corporate earnings and a slew of liquidity and regulatory measures by the RBI. Domestic equities, however, witnessed cautious trading towards the end of the month due to uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the US presidential elections. In November, the BSE Sensex gained by 11.4 per cent, supported by FPI inflows, positive developments on the vaccine and the Government\u2019s approval of a `1.5 lakh crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for 10 manufacturing sectors. Equity markets extended their gains in December 2020 amidst better- than-expected GDP data for Q2:2020-21, expectations of swifter global economic recovery after the US stimulus package and the announcement of Brexit trade deal. Subsequently, the emergence of new strains of coronavirus in the UK and several other countries dampened sentiments and capped market rallies. Overall, the BSE Sensex increased by 25.4 per cent during Q3:2020-21. of 52154 on February 15, 2021 riding on the budget euphoria. Markets, however, declined towards the end of the month following a spike in US treasury cases in a few Indian states. The equity market resumed its upward trajectory in early March 2021 following robust GST collections, positive GDP data ebullience, however, sobered reflecting worries and a surge in infections in certain states. During H2, FPIs were net buyers to the tune of `1.98 lakh crore while MFs were net sellers amounting to `0.99 lakh crore in the Indian equity market (Chart IV.12b). Resource mobilisation through public and rights issues of equity increased to `1.04 lakh crore during 2020-21 (up to February 2021) from `66,324 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. In January 2021, domestic markets surged on the back of upbeat corporate results for Q3:2020-21 During H2:2020-21, the Indian rupee (INR) traded mostly with an appreciating bias against the US 2020, the INR appreciated to `72.29 on February 24, 2021 owing to sustained strong FPI inflows but depreciated somewhat thereafter due to elevated global financial market volatility on the back of rising US yields, firming global crude prices and moderation Strong FPI flows to most EMEs, largely driven by ample global liquidity, have induced an appreciation of their currencies. The appreciation of INR was modest depreciated between September 2020 and February rate (NEER), the INR depreciated by 0.2 per cent dollar on the back of growth revival and robust foreign investments amidst a weakening US dollar (Chart IV.13). After some depreciation in November 2020), while it depreciated by 1.4 per cent in terms of A cross-market financial barometer illustrates the recovery in financial markets from the height of the pandemic-induced disruptions.4 The barometer presents four different stages since the declaration of the pandemic. In response to the gradual unlocking of the economy and resumption of normal market activity, all nine indicators suggest improvement in financial market sentiments in March 2021 vis-\u00e0-vis the elevated stress levels of March and May 2020 (Chart IV.15). 4 The barometer consists of nine indicators across four markets (money, bonds, foreign exchange and equities) and compares the level of each indicator on a certain day with its pre-turmoil level (calibrated as zero on the scale) and with its level at a \u2018peak\u2019 in the turmoil (calibrated as 100). Negative column for an indicator indicate values lower than its pre-turmoil level. The pre-turmoil level for all indicators is taken as January 1, 2020, while the peak turmoil day is indicator specific and happens to concentrate around March 24, 2020 (the day of imposition of country-wide lockdown) and in some cases in May 2020 (see Chapter IV of Monetary Policy Report, October 2020). Credit offtake improved in H2, with the momentum picking up beginning October and registering a positive growth (financial year basis) since November. Non-food credit by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose by 6.4 per cent (y-o-y as on March 12) as compared with 6.1 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.16). Credit growth accelerated across all bank groups, especially public sector banks (PSBs) (Chart IV.17a). Of the incremental credit extended by SCBs on a y-o-y basis (March 12, 2021 over March 13, 2020), 53.8 per cent was provided by PSBs, 45.7 per cent by private sector banks and 0.5 per cent by foreign banks (Chart IV.17b). Among major sectors5, credit to agriculture grew by 10.2 per cent (y-o-y) in February 2021 \u2013 the highest since April 2017 (Chart IV.18a). Credit growth to the services sector also remained strong. Credit to the industrial sector, however, contracted marginally by 0.2 per cent, mainly due to a decline in credit to large industries (which account for more than 80 per cent of credit to the industrial sector). On the positive side, credit to medium industries registered a robust growth of 21.0 per cent, reflecting the measures taken by the Government of India and the RBI for enhancing credit flows to the MSME sector. In terms of the contribution of different sectors in incremental credit, personal loans accounted for the largest share (41.7 per cent), followed by the services sector (39.0 per cent) (Chart IV.18b). In the overall non-food credit growth of February 2021, the relative contributions of personal loans and credit to the services sector 5 Data on sectoral credit relate to select banks accounting for around 90 per cent of the total non-food credit. were 2.7 percentage points and 2.5 percentage points, respectively (Chart IV.18c). to February 2021) mainly due to robust credit offtake in transport operators and trade segments (Chart IV.19a). Within industry, credit to mining and quarrying, food processing, beverages and tobacco, textile, gems and jewellery, vehicle, vehicle parts and transport equipment registered accelerated growth (on a y-o-y basis) in February 2021. Credit growth to petroleum, coal products and nuclear fuels and cement and cement products, however, decelerated, while that to chemicals and chemical products, basic metal and metal products, construction, all engineering and infrastructure contracted. Unlike the sharp deceleration in credit to the industrial sector, that to the services sector accelerated during H2:2020-21 (up On a financial year basis (up to February 2021), credit growth to the services sector accelerated at a modest pace (Chart IV.19b). Personal loans segment, which has generally performed well in recent years, decelerated during H2 so far primarily due to a sharp slowdown in growth of housing loans, its largest component (Chart IV.19c). Amongst other constituents of personal loans, consumer durable loans and credit card outstanding witnessed tepid growth while loans against gold and jewellery picked up significantly (Chart IV.19d). The asset quality of SCBs improved during 2020-21 (up to December), with the overall non-performing assets (NPA) ratio declining to 6.8 per cent in December from 8.3 per cent in March 2020, reflecting mainly the regulatory dispensations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Chart IV.20a). The NPA ratios eased across all the major sectors over the same period (Chart IV.20b). Banks\u2019 non-SLR investments, i.e., investments in CPs, bonds, debentures and shares of public and private corporates fell in H2:2020-21 (up to March 12) (Chart IV.21a). Adjusted non-food credit growth (i.e., non- food credit including non-SLR investments) increased to 6.0 per cent as on March 12, 2021 from 5.5 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.21b). With muted credit offtake, strong deposit growth and increased government market borrowings, banks augmented their SLR investments. Excess SLR holdings increased to 11.4 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) on February 26, 2021 from 8.2 per cent at end-March 2020 (Chart IV.22). of normalcy in financial markets; however, it remained elevated for private sector banks (Chart IV.23). Spreads of WALRs on outstanding rupee loans and fresh rupee loans over 1-year MCLR were the lowest in respect of housing loans, reflecting lower defaults and the availability of collateral (Chart IV.24). Other personal loans i.e. loans other than housing, vehicle and education loans are mostly unsecured and involve Monetary transmission to deposit and lending rates of banks improved significantly during 2020-21, aided by large surplus liquidity, the implementation of the external benchmark system and subdued credit demand. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declined by 107 bps since March 2020 in response to the reduction of 115 bps in the policy repo rate (Table IV.4). The median spread charged by public sector banks returned to pre-COVID levels with the gradual return higher credit risk and hence, the spread was the highest for this category. The lower WALRs on rupee export credit reflected the interest rate subvention provided by the government. There has been a significant improvement in transmission to all new loans sanctioned since October 2019 in respect of the retail and MSE sectors where the new floating rate loans were mandatorily linked to one of the prescribed external benchmarks.6 The quantum of decline in WALRs on MSME loans, housing loans, vehicle loans and other personal loans exceeded the decline in WALR on aggregate fresh rupee loans to all sectors (138 bps) during the same period (Chart IV.25). Notably, the introduction of external benchmark linked loans has incentivised banks to adjust their term as well as saving deposit rates in line with the benchmark rates to protect their net interest margins (NIMs), thus accelerating the pace of transmission to lending rates by bringing down the overall MCLR and, in turn, lending rates on other sectors as well.7 (Percentage points) Note: Figures in parentheses are number of banks. Source: RBI. spread charged by public sector banks for different categories of loans was lower than those of private sector banks. In respect of fresh rupee loans linked to the policy repo rate, the median spread charged by domestic banks was the highest in the case of other personal loans, which are mostly unsecured as indicated earlier (Table IV.5). Among the bank groups, the median The responsiveness of term deposit rates to policy rate changes has also improved in the past year, reflecting the combined impact of surplus liquidity, the external benchmark-based pricing of loans and weak credit demand. The weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on outstanding rupee deposits declined by 152 bps during the ongoing easing cycle (i.e., since February 2019), of which the decline of 106 bps has occurred since March 2020. The median term deposit rate, which reflects the prevailing card rates, has registered a sizeable decline of 144 bps since March 2020 (Chart IV.26). Apart from the reduction in term deposit rates, banks have also lowered their saving deposit rates. These deposit rates of five major banks, which ranged 3.50- 4.00 per cent at the beginning of the current easing cycle (early February 2019) and 3.25-3.50 per cent immediately prior to the introduction of the external benchmark were placed at 2.70-3.00 per cent in March 2021. This adjustment in saving deposit rates is critical for transmission, given their large share (33.0 per cent as on March 12, 2021) in aggregate deposits. 6 Loans to medium enterprises were also mandatorily linked to the external benchmark, effective April 1, 2020. 7 The reduction in term deposit rates applies only to fresh term deposits, while it is across the board in the case of saving deposits.

Normal liquidity management operations \u2013 suspended in April 2020 in the face of COVID-related dislocations \u2013 were resumed in January 2021 with the Reserve Bank reiterating the availability of ample liquidity in the system. Overall, the total liquidity support announced by the Reserve Bank since February 6, 2020 (up to March 31, 2021) amounted to `13.6 lakh crore [6.7 (6.9) per cent of 2019-20 (2020-21) nominal GDP] (Table IV.7).

Banks returned TLTRO funds amounting to `0.37 lakh crore \u2013 33.1 per cent of the total amount of `1.13 lakh crore availed under the scheme. In Q4, surplus liquidity increased further to `5.9 lakh crore due to injection from forex through CiC and reduced government spending. Total OMO purchases during 2020-21 amounted to `3.13 lakh crore. Reserve money (RM) increased by 14.2 per cent (y-o-y) during 2020-21 (up to March 26) driven by currency demand while money supply (M3) increased in During Q3, currency in circulation (CiC) was the major source of leakage of liquidity (`0.95 lakh crore), which was more than offset by the infusion through net forex operations (`2.0 lakh crore) and OMO purchases The surplus liquidity was mopped up through the overnight fixed rate reverse repo under the LAF and 9 The Reserve Bank also conducted six auctions of simultaneous purchase and sale of securities under open market operations (special OMOs) during this period. Five 14-day VRRR auctions of `2 lakh crore each were conducted in Q4, which were well received as reflected in the bid-cover ratio (bidding offers as a proportion of the notified amount) of 1.3 or more in each auction. The liquidity absorbed through the fixed rate reverse repo has steadily increased from a fortnightly average of `4.3 lakh crore during January 16-29, 2021 to `4.9 lakh crore during January 30 - March 31 (Chart IV.30). OMOs \u2013 both purchases and sales \u2013 are a key instrument to adjust the durable liquidity in the banking system in sync with the monetary policy stance. During 2020- 21, `1.00 lakh crore was infused through outright purchases from eight auction announcements (including three of state development loans). These announcements contributed to softening of yields (Box IV.1). Note: Net forex purchases are cumulative from October 2020. Source: RBI. OMO auctions conducted by the central bank not only impact government bond yields but also have a significant effect on other financial instruments, given that these are priced off risk-free government bonds. The instantaneous announcement effect of OMOs is examined for the benchmark 10-year government securities, AAA 5-year corporate bonds (CBs) and 5-year overnight index swaps (OIS)10 using daily data on secondary market yields/ rates spanning 10 years (January 2012 \u2013 January 2021) in an event study (ES) framework (Hartley and Rebucci, 2020). During the sample period, there were 98 OMO announcements \u2013 83 purchases and 15 sales. These announcements were made after the closure of market trading hours; therefore, the difference in yields between the opening rate of the next trading day and the closing rate of the OMO announcement day, controlled for other factors, captures the announcement effect. average, of (i) 2 bps on G-sec and corporate bonds; and (ii) 1 bps on OIS, validating the presence of announcement effects (Table IV.1.1)12. The is corroborated by regression analysis of the events (OMO announcements) with appropriate controls viz., for intra- day global factors through the global economic policy uncertainty index [GEPUI]13, the inter-day difference in yields/rates on the announcement day as an indicator of Note: Close (0): Announcement day closing; Open (+1): Next day opening; Close (+1): Next day closing. ** represents significance at 5 per cent. 10 In OIS transactions, one of the counterparties swaps an overnight interest rate while the other swaps a fixed short-term rate. The spread between these two rates is an important indicator of financial market conditions \u2013 widening spreads signifying tight liquidity conditions. 11 The paired sample t-test determines whether the mean difference between two sets of observations in a large sample is zero. 12 Similar tests for OMO sales announcements suggest that there is no statistically significant difference in yields; hence the empirical exercise is confined to OMO purchases. \u0394Y (open(+1)-close(0)) \u0394Y (open(+1)-close(0)) \u0394Y (open(+1)-close(0)) \u0394Y (open(+1)-close(0)) \u0394Y (open(+1)-close(0)) \u0394Y (open(+1)-close(0)) ***, ** and * represent significance at 1 per cent, 5 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively.

Apart from these variables, the size of the OMO auction is included in the second regression (Reg-2). Finally, for identifying the impact of the prevailing liquidity conditions on the announcement effect, an interaction term between the size of the OMO purchase announcement and the liquidity conditions on the announcement day is also included in the third regression (Reg-3).15 The impact of the OMO announcement is captured by the constant term (C) in Reg-1 and by the coefficients on OMO auction amounts (as percentage of NDTL) in Reg-2 and Reg-3. All the control variables are demeaned (by taking deviation from the mean). only in the G-sec segment, increased global uncertainty marginally hardens across markets (statistically significant). Every `10,000 crore of OMO auction announcement (equivalent to 0.1 per cent of NDTL, on an average) eases yields/rates by 1-2 bps (Reg-2). The interaction term in Reg-3 is found to be statistically significant in the G-sec and corporate bond segment, suggesting that the prevailing liquidity situation also matters \u2013 thus, the announcement effect is expected to be larger in deficit liquidity conditions. Overall, the analysis indicates that the OMO announcements during 2020-21 have cumulatively eased G-sec and corporate bond yields by about 20-25 bps each and the OIS rates by around 10 bps. Special OMOs (OTs), LTRO and TLTRO auctions also had a significant impact on G-sec yields, thereby moderating the term spread (Talwar et. al, 2021). Reg-1: \u03b13, and \u03b14 = 0 Reg-2: C and \u03b14 = 0 Reg-3: C = 0 The estimates of Reg-1 indicate that, on an average, the OMO announcements soften G-sec, corporate bond yields and OIS rates by 2-3 basis points (bps) each (Table IV.I.2). While the hysteresis phenomenon is significant 14 For corporate bonds, the daily difference in yields is used to capture the hysteresis effect. 15 Both the announced amount and the liquidity position (net LAF) are normalised by NDTL. To nurture the revival of activity in sectors that have multiplier effects on growth, the Reserve Bank announced \u201cOn-tap targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO)\u201d with tenors of up to three years for a total amount of up to `1 lakh crore at a floating rate linked to the policy repo rate in October 2020. The liquidity availed by banks under the scheme is to be deployed in corporate bonds, commercial paper and non-convertible debentures issued by the entities in five sectors16 over and above their investments in these instruments as on September 30, 2020. Moreover, to enable banks to exploit the synergies between central bank liquidity under on-tap TLTRO scheme and the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme 2.0 (ECLGS 2.0) of the Central Government, the Reserve Bank expanded the scope of the on-tap TLTRO in December to all stressed sectors identified by the Kamath Committee in addition to the five sectors announced earlier in October 2020. In February 2021, the RBI (i) allowed lending by banks to NBFCs under the TLTRO on-tap scheme for incremental lending to specified stressed sectors; (ii) announced a gradual restoration of the cash reserve ratio (CRR) in two phases in a non-disruptive manner to 3.5 per cent of NDTL effective March 27, 2021 and 4.0 per cent effective May 22, 2021; (iii) extended the facility for availing funds under the marginal standing facility (MSF) by dipping into the SLR up to 3.0 per cent of NDTL until September 30, 2021; and (iv) provided CRR exemption for credit flows to new MSME borrowers on exposures up to `25 lakh per borrower for credit extended up to October 1, 2021. During H2:2020-21, thirteen auctions of OTs have been conducted. In March, the scale of OTs was increased to `15,000 crore (on March 4) and subsequently an asymmetric OT having a liquidity impact (purchase `20,000 crore; sales `15,000 crore) was conducted on March 10, 2021 which elicited favourable response on the purchase leg with bid-cover ratio of 4. As staff and IT resources were severely affected in financial markets with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the RBI shortened trading hours for various markets regulated by it effective April 7, 2020. Subsequently, with the phased roll-back of the lockdown and easing of restrictions on movement of people and resumption of normal functioning of offices, the RBI decided to restore trading hours in a phased manner beginning November 9, 2020. To meet any additional / unforeseen demand for liquidity and to provide flexibility to the banking liquidity management, the system Reserve Bank decided to conduct two fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions of ` 0.25 lakh crore each on March 26 and March 31, 2021 of 11 days and 5 days tenor, respectively. Furthermore, it was decided not to conduct the 14-day VRRR auction on March 26 to ensure the availability of ample liquidity for managing year-end requirements. During H2, domestic financial markets and conditions remained congenial, supported by ample surplus liquidity. Market activity continued to revive, building on the recovery witnessed in the later part of H1 and steered by the forward guidance provided on liquidity and the orderly evolution of the yield curve. The pace of monetary transmission improved further and bank credit growth registered an upturn. Going forward, the RBI\u2019s market operations would ensure ample surplus liquidity in consonance with the accommodative policy stance to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. 16 Agriculture, agri-infrastructure, secured retail, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and drugs, pharmaceuticals and healthcare. In Q1:2021 (January-March), the global economy gradually regained momentum. Rapid mutations of the virus, concerns over the effectiveness of available vaccines and limited access to vaccines in many countries keep the near- term outlook clouded and the recovery remains fragile, incomplete, uneven and divergent. Inflation risks are widely perceived to be rising in an environment of exceptional monetary and fiscal accommodation, leading to turbulence in global financial markets and capital outflows from emerging markets in the second half of Q1:2021. In Q1:2021 (January-March), the global economy gradually regained momentum of recovery gathered in Q3:2020, which had encountered headwinds in Q4 as many advanced economies (AEs) and some emerging market economies (EMEs) had to reimpose restrictions/lockdowns in the wake of second/third wave of infections coupled with the newer and more virulent strains of the virus. Mass vaccination drives are underway in several countries, but rapid mutations of the virus, concerns over the effectiveness of available vaccines and limited access to vaccines in many countries keep the near-term outlook clouded and the recovery remains fragile, incomplete, uneven and divergent. leading to turbulence in global financial markets and capital outflows from emerging markets in the second Economic activity across major AEs and EMEs posted a strong recovery in Q3:2020, following a record plunge in Q2 amidst widespread lockdowns. As stated earlier, activity stalled again in Q4 as countries battled mutations of the virus. With inoculations underway, up in Q1:2021. Nonetheless, activity remains below Prolonged monetary accommodation, easy financial conditions and rounds of fiscal stimulus buoyed stock markets around the world, with strong rallies pushing equity valuations to record levels in February 2021 to a point of disconnect with the real economy. In the bond market, short term yields remain anchored on low policy rates, but longer-term yields have surged since the second half of February 2021 across the world on rising inflation expectations and apprehensions about possible reversal of monetary policy stances. In turn, equity and currency markets have experienced bouts of volatility. Commodity prices continue to spiral up under a combination of supply disruptions and revival of demand, translating into intensifying input price pressures on account of severely stretched supply chains. Consequently, inflation risks are widely perceived to be rising in an environment of The US economy contracted by 3.5 per cent in 2020, marking an abrupt halt to its expansion for more than a decade (Table V.1).

Quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualised rate (Q-o-q, SAAR) The Japanese economy expanded by 11.7 per cent (q-o-q, SAAR) in Q4, extending the third quarter\u2019s recovery from the worst recession witnessed in the first half of 2020. Resilient trade conditions as reflected in a strong pick-up in exports and high capital spending underpinned by significant government support led to the GDP expansion. With the third wave of COVID-19 infections and the re- imposition of the state of emergency in the Tokyo area, however, the momentum for recovery slowed down in Q1, accompanied by large contractions in retail sales and industrial production in January and February. The manufacturing PMI, on the other hand, expanded in February 2021 for the first time since April 2019, with March witnessing further expansion. In the UK, GDP expanded in Q4, but it moderated from the record pace registered in Q3, leading to an overall contraction of 9.8 per cent in 2020. In early Q1:2021, infections reached new peaks, with newer and more contagious variants pushing the economy into its third nationwide lockdown in January. Furthermore, the new trading arrangement with the European Union (EU) post-Brexit is likely to weigh on activity in early 2021. E: Estimate. P: Projection. -: Not applicable. Note: India's data correspond to fiscal year (April-March). Sources: Bloomberg; Official statistical agency of each country and IMF WEO Update, January 2021. Euro area GDP declined by 6.6 per cent in 2020, with Q4 reading reversing the strong rebound witnessed in Q3 as emergence of the second wave of the virus along with more virulent strains led to a re-clamping of lockdowns across major constituent economies. This weakness continued into Q1:2021 with most economies extending lockdown restrictions even as they continued with the slow pace of vaccination. Consumer and business sentiments remain weak, with declining retail sales in January and the fourth The economic recovery continued in China for the third consecutive quarter in Q4, resulting in an overall annual increase of 2.3 per cent in 2020 and making it the only major economy to register growth in a pandemic-ravaged year (Table V.2). China\u2019s growth has been powered by strong and robust recovery in manufacturing and exports underpinned by policy support measures. By contrast, the recovery in consumption activity remains relatively weak. The Chinese economy seems to have lost some steam in Q1 from COVID-19 flare-ups in January and the associated containment measures.

The Brazilian economy contracted in Q4 on y-o-y basis following declines in household and government consumption expenditure, while weak services and external sector activity added further downward pressures. The near-term growth outlook remains clouded with emergency transfer programs expected to unwind, while the more contagious COVID-19 P1 variant continues to spread rapidly weighing heavily on economic activity with the composite PMI reflecting contraction since January 2021. a slow vaccine rollout and renewed load shedding.

Across major South-East Asian economies, GDP declined Q4:2020, with contraction varying in the range of The global composite PMI moderated during The Russian economy contracted in 2020, with a modest recovery in H2 (July-December) preventing a deeper plunge. The South African economy rebounded sharply in Q3:2020 following a historic plunge in Q2, driven primarily by manufacturing, mining and trade activity. In Q4, the recovery slowed down, with new waves of the deadly virus amidst pulled down services activity, especially in the contact-intensive industries. There was some uptick in the US (Chart V.1a). Composite leading indicators (CLIs) suggest growth is stabilising across major AEs Global trade recovered faster than expected from the deep contraction witnessed in Q2:2020 on the back of the robust trade performance of EMEs (Chart V.2a). The WTO\u2019s Goods Trade Barometer rebounded in Q4:2020; however, this momentum is unlikely to be sustained in H1:2021 (January-June) as its key constituents such as export orders and automotive products have started showing signs of deceleration. The Baltic Dry Index, which measures shipping costs for a wide variety of bulk commodities such as coal, iron ore, and grain, rose sharply in January and February 2021 due to firming container shipping freight rates and an unfavourable base effect (Chart V.2b). Global commodity prices have been rising since May, after recovering from a plunge in the early part of 2020. The Bloomberg commodity price index increased by 17.8 per cent between September 2020 and March 2021. The food price index of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) increased by 18.4 per cent between September 2020 and February 2021 \u2013 the index was at its highest level in February 2021 since July 2014, with pressures being particularly high for vegetable oil prices due to tightening availability of supplies among major exporters. For meat, low demand for poultry meat amidst avian influenza outbreaks has kept price pressures somewhat muted (Chart V.3a). Crude oil prices lost some steam in September- October on waning demand prospects but have picked up since November on vaccine optimism and extension of production cuts by OPEC plus. The US stimulus and Brexit agreement further boosted the market sentiments. In February, prices surged to their highest level since the pandemic amidst tightening global supplies and falling crude inventories in the US and Europe. Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to voluntarily cut production by an additional 1.0 million barrels per day during February-April added to bullish sentiments. Following an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, Brent prices increased further, moving closer to US$70 per barrel in mid-March. However, prices corrected thereafter, on near-term demand concerns amidst rising infections and build up in the US crude inventories. Despite the correction, Brent crude prices increased by 21.9 per cent in Q1:2021 (Chart 3b). Base metal prices, measured by the Bloomberg\u2019s base metal spot index, increased by 28.4 per cent between September 2020 and March 2021, surpassing pre-COVID levels on strong rallies witnessed in H2:2020. The upturn has been primarily driven by strong restocking by China and positive stimulus measures sentiments propelled by across major economies. The robust recovery in manufacturing and industrial activity along with persistent supply chain disruptions, shipping difficulties and labour and container shortages have boosted prices of industrial metals. In contrast, gold prices after wrapping up the year 2020 with a phenomenal gain of 25.1 per cent, lost sheen with prices correcting by 10.0 per cent in Q1:2021. Rising US bond yields, the strengthening US dollar and strong risk-on sentiments reduced the safe haven CPI inflation remains benign and below target in major AEs, while for major EMEs, barring China, Thailand and Indonesia, CPI inflation has mostly picked up, even moving above targets in a few of them In the US, inflation based on the personal consumer expenditures (PCE) price index has risen since December. However, average inflation remains well below the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target as relatively soft energy prices contained price pressures.

The Fed adopted \u2018flexible average inflation targeting\u2019 in August 2020 wherein it would allow the inflation rate to go above the target of 2 per cent rate for brief periods to make up for the shortfall from the target in earlier periods.

(4) Brazil\u2019s inflation target for 2020 was 4.0 \u00b1 1.5 per cent. low and below the ECB\u2019s target owing to substantial slack in product and labour markets. In Japan, CPI remained in deflation for the fifth consecutive month in February as COVID-19 weighed on demand; lower crude oil prices in the initial period and discounts on travel within Japan through the \u2018Go To Travel\u2019 campaign by the national government added to the downside. In the UK, CPI inflation remains relatively subdued over both direct and indirect COVID-induced factors, particularly the reduction in value added tax for certain services and lower energy prices. Despite some pick-up in December-January, it remains way below the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE's) target (Chart V.5a). and utilities, and miscellaneous goods and services. In February, however, it eased marginally, moving below the central bank\u2019s target range on softening health and food prices. China, on the other hand, registered deflation since November, barring December. There has been a significant easing in consumer prices due to lower pork prices on improved supply and favourable base effects. Renewed lockdown restrictions due to fresh outbreaks resulting in decreased travel and consumer spending before the Chinese new year in February also kept the price pressures low (Chart V.5b). In Russia, the inflation rate has overshot the target since November 2020, primarily attributed to the weakening ruble and firming global commodity prices, especially food prices, besides the lingering supply side disruptions inflicted by the pandemic. In Brazil too, CPI inflation has edged up, though it remains within the central bank\u2019s target range. The increase in global commodity prices, the depreciating Brazilian real and rapid recovery in domestic demand supported by emergency aid programs, led to the upward pressures in prices. CPI inflation in South Africa saw some uptick in January on higher prices for food, housing In order to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their domestic economies, governments and central banks have provided unprecedented and large fiscal and monetary stimuli since March 2020. The IMF estimates that the total fiscal support pledged in 2020 through additional spending, revenue foregone and liquidity support was about US$14 trillion or 13.5 per cent of world GDP (Table V.4).

The FOMC increased the per counterparty actively pursuing green goals (Box V.1). 1 The US$ approximations for all amounts mentioned in another currency in this Chapter are based on the exchange rate (Bloomberg) on the date of announcement of the particular measure. In 2020, the average temperature of global land and ocean surfaces was 1.17\u00b0C higher than the twentieth-century average of 13.9\u00b0C, making it the second warmest year on record. The five warmest years since 1880 have been only recently after 2015 (Chart V.1.1a). Global temperatures are expected to increase by another 1.5 degree between 2030 and 2052, and to continue upwards thereafter [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2018]. The rise in global temperature is mainly attributed to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation changes in the global atmospheric circulation have been wild, influencing, in turn, temperature and precipitation across the globe (Chart V.1.1b). The higher global temperatures and the associated shifts in weather patterns are key risks to the growth and inflation outlook across AEs and EMEs through various channels. While the most evident channel is agricultural output, others could be adverse effects on labour productivity, mortality rates and investment decisions (Acevedo et al., 2018; Batten, 2020). Thus, climate change poses severe challenges to the central banks\u2019 mandate of price and financial stability. Conventional models followed by the central banks cannot predict climate-related risks accurately, including exposure to \u201cgreen swan\u201d3 risks, which are in nature of \u201cclimate black swan events\u201d, i.e., extreme financially disruptive events that could be the next systemic financial crisis (Bolton et al. 2020). In 2017, eight central banks and supervisors established the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) which had 89 central banks and supervisors from around the world by March 2021. The NGFS recommended integration of climate-related factors into prudential supervision and emphasised the importance of a robust and internationally consistent climate and environmental disclosure framework. A recent survey of 26 central banks reveals that central banks consider climate change to be an emerging challenge both in terms of its potential threat to the economy and impact on their operational frameworks (NGFS, 2020). The prime motivation for the central banks is to mitigate financial risks on their balance sheets due to exposures to climate change related risks. Furthermore, central banks are in favour of formulating pro-active measures in moving towards a low-carbon economy while ensuring smooth monetary transmission over the long-term (Table V.1.1). @: Deviations of average annual global surface temperatures (land and ocean) since 1880 from the long-term average (1901-2000).

In general, smoothed time series of the SOI correspond very well with changes in ocean temperatures across the eastern tropical Pacific. Prolonged periods of negative (positive) SOI values coincide with abnormally warm (cold) ocean waters across the eastern tropical Pacific typical of El Ni\u00f1o (La Ni\u00f1a) episodes.

(2020) was inspired by the famous concept of \u201cblack swan\u201d developed by Taleb (2007) [Taleb, Nassim N. 2007. The Black Swan. New York: Penguin Random House]. Black swan events are rare and unexpected events with low probability but heavy impacts. Such events can only be explained after they happen. To sum up, changing weather patterns and increased reliance on bioenergy could increase the volatility of food and energy prices and hence impart substantial volatility to headline inflation, making it challenging for central banks to meet their inflation targets. Nowcasting and forecasting models of central banks need to be augmented to adequately account for weather effects. Bolton P., D. Morgan, da Silva. L. A. P., S. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and S.

Available at: https:// www.ipcc.ch/sr15/ The Bank of Japan (BoJ) in December 2020 extended the duration of the special program to support financing in response to COVID-19 by six months to September 2021 and made adjustments to the programme. Following a review of the measures taken under \u201cquantitative and qualitative monetary easing with yield curve control\u201d, the BoJ announced further effective and sustainable monetary easing in March 2021: (i) establishment of an \u201cInterest Scheme to Promote Lending\u201d under which interest rates, linked to the short-term policy rate, would apply as an incentive to financial institutions' current account balances with the BoJ, corresponding to amount lent by the institutions under eligible fund-provisioning measures; (ii) the range of 10-year government bond yield fluctuations would be +/- 25 basis points (bps) from the target level; and (iii) the annual target for purchase of exchange-traded funds and Japan real estate investment trusts has been removed, while the ceiling has been retained. policy relating to sustainable house prices. In March, the RBNZ withdrew a few temporary liquidity facilities, which were introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as they had low usage. Amongst the major AE central banks, Australia and Iceland reduced policy rates in Q4:2020. In November, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cuts its policy rate by 15 bps to a new low of 0.10 per cent and reduced the target for 3-year government bond yields to the same level. It also launched a quantitative easing programme of purchase of government bonds of 5-10 years maturity worth AUD100 billion (approximately US$72 billion) to be carried out over six months. In February 2021, the RBA extended the asset purchase programme that was to end by mid-April 2021 by six months with purchase of additional AUD100 billion (approximately US$76 billion). In March, the RBA indicated that it had adjusted bond purchases to enable smooth functioning of the market and would do more, if required. The central bank of Iceland reduced its policy rate by 25 bps in November to 0.75 per cent (Chart V.6a). The Bank of Canada (BoC) has maintained a pause on the policy rate since reducing it to 0.25 per cent in March 2020. In October, the BoC announced it would gradually reduce quantum of weekly purchase of government securities, while recalibrating its quantitative easing program towards longer-term bonds that have a more direct influence on borrowing rates. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has maintained its policy rate at the historic low of 0.25 per cent since March 2020. In November, the RBNZ announced additional stimulus in the form of a \u201cFunding for Lending Programme\u201d aimed at reducing banks\u2019 funding costs. In February 2021, the RBNZ stated that it had completed the operational work to make its policy rate, the official cash rate, negative if need arose for further monetary stimulus. The New Zealand government modified the MPC\u2019s remit with effect from March 1, 2021 to assess and outline, inter alia, the impact of its decisions on the government\u2019s Given the conventional policy space, a few EMEs cut the policy rates further in 2021, while others started reversing monetary stimulus. The People\u2019s Bank of China has maintained the one-year Loan Prime Rate at 3.85 per cent since April 2020, while the South African Reserve Bank has maintained its policy rate at 3.5 per cent since July 2020. After maintaining a pause through Q4:2020, in January 2021, Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) withdrew the forward guidance introduced in August 2020 when the underlying measures of inflation were below the target. In its March meeting, with inflation projected to be at the upper bound of the target, the BCB raised the Selic rate by 75 bps to 2.75 per cent and indicated that a similar magnitude hike will likely be effected in its next policy meeting. The Bank of Russia, after maintaining a pause through Q4:2020, raised the policy rate by 25 bps to 4.5 per cent in March and indicated that it was a beginning of return to neutral monetary policy. The central bank of Turkey followed up the rate hike in September 2020 with an increase of 475 bps in November and by another 200 bps each in December 2020 and March 2021 and indicated that the tight monetary policy stance would be maintained decisively for an extended period until strong indicators pointed to a permanent fall in inflation. Amongst other EME central banks, Bank Indonesia (BI) and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas cut their policy rates by 25 bps each in Q4: 2020 (November), while BI and Banco de M\u00e9xico cut rates by 25 bps each in February during Q1:2021 (Chart V.6b). The global financial markets remained buoyant, supported by highly accommodative monetary and fiscal policies and vaccine-led recovery optimism. Stock markets reached record highs in a few jurisdictions in February 2021, despite output being well-below pre-pandemic path, raising concerns of a disconnect between the markets and the real economy and risks of future financial fragility (Box V.2). Among AEs, US equity markets scaled new peaks every month between November 2020 and March 2021. Apart from the earlier noted ultra-accommodative monetary policy and vaccine news, the US markets were also boosted by the Presidential election results in early November and the additional fiscal stimulus packages in December and March. In Q1:2021, there were episodes of correction, mostly due to surge in yields in the bond market. Among other major AEs also, November 2020 was one of the best months on record in terms of gains. The UK and the EU stock indices moved up, benefitting additionally from the trade agreement concluded before the expiry of the transitional period following Brexit. Towards end-January 2021, these indices corrected due to the volatility brought on by US markets and again in the second half of February. In March, the indices were up again to almost 13-month highs. The Nikkei crossed 30,000 in February 2021 for the first time since 1990. Stock markets in EMEs powered further ahead through Q4:2020 and up to Under the unprecedented and continuing monetary accommodation by most central banks, financial markets across the world have been exuberant. Equity markets touched record highs, even as COVID-19 pushed the global economy into its severest contraction in decades. This is in sharp contrast to the typical co- movement between the equity markets and the real economy, especially in severely stressed situations (Chart V.2.1). markets at the global level. The variables included in the empirical exercise are: MSCI world stock index (LWorld_ stk), World GDP (LWorld_GDP), gold prices (LGold) and yield on 10-year US government securities (US_10yr)4. All the variables are integrated of order one, i.e., I(1), and the Johansen-cointegration test reveals the presence of one long-run cointegrating relationship5. The estimated long- run equation from a vector error correction model (VECM) is as follows: The apparent disconnect between the real economy and asset prices could be due to non-price factors (Claessens and Kose, 2017). A steep decline in risk premiums and risk-free discount rates have driven up asset prices (Igan et al., 2020). Certain segments of the equity markets, particularly small-cap, health and pharmaceuticals, and technology notched higher gains than others. Despite episodic corrections, the US S&P and the Indian BSE Sensex, inter alia, reached all-time highs in Q1:2021. Though reflation trade, creeping bond yields and inflation expectations led to a correction in the stock markets in the latter part of February, markets picked up again in March with the US stimulus, mainly in AEs. Against this backdrop, a preliminary examination has been undertaken to understand the drivers of stock Figures in parentheses are estimated t-values. All coefficients are statistically significant at 1 per cent level. The results suggest that higher real GDP growth boosts equity prices, while higher interest rates and gold prices are associated with corrections in equity prices. A higher level of GDP growth translates to higher corporate earnings, which in turn results in higher equity returns (Gracia and Liu, 1999). Rise in yields and gold prices presents portfolio diversification options, and are 4 quarterly series. The sample period is from Q1:2005 to Q4:2020. 5 GFC for COVID-19, taper tantrum and global financial crisis episodes, respectively, were included. All data, barring LWorld_GDP, were sourced from Bloomberg. For LWorld_GDP, annual world GDP levels given by the IMF were interpolated to obtain To control for periods of excessive volatility and uncertainty in economic conditions, three dummies, viz., Dummy_COVID, Dummy_TT and Dummy_ of the \u0394LWorld_stk is statistically significant with the correct negative sign implying that the stock prices adjust towards long-run relationship after a shock and that the estimated model is stable (Table V.1.1). In the case of a shock, gold prices are the quickest to adjust, followed by stock prices. Summing up, unprecedented large scale monetary and fiscal accommodation by most countries and vaccine optimism have contributed to a sharp rebound in stock markets across the world. The empirical evidence still supports the conventional wisdom that a long-run relationship holds between the financial markets and the real sector. Notes: 1.

The short-run dynamics show that the coefficient of the error correction term mid Q1:2021, mirroring those in the US and other AEs expectations. In February, the large sell-offs saw longer and supported by burgeoning foreign portfolio flows (Chart V.7). With resumption of capital outflows since the latter part of February, EME stock indices have shed gains. shoot up, leading to steepening of the yield curve. The 10-year yield at end-March 2021 was 106 bps higher Bond yields remained low in major AEs till end- 2020 driven by low or negative policy rates, forward guidance of low for longer, explicit yield curve control policies in a few countries and safe haven demand due to continued uncertainty with new rounds of infections, fatalities and virus mutations. In the US, however, bond yields have been inching up gradually from Q3:2020 on expectations of reflation (Chart V.8a). In January 2021, the 10-year yield rose above 1 per cent for the first time since March 2020 on expectations of further stimulus by the new US administration, better economic recovery prospects and rising inflation There has also been a steepening of the yield curve policy rates have kept the short-term yields low, while longer maturities have been rising. This necessitated which practice yield curve control. The rise in yields led to portfolio reallocation resulting in correction in equity markets noted above. In currency markets, the US dollar weakened further in Q4:2020. In 2021, it has strengthened mainly due to rising bond yields and expectations of higher inflation and higher interest rates. As regards emerging market currencies, there has been resumption of capital outflows in Q1:2021 from most regions, causing the emerging markets currencies to depreciate (Chart V.8b). The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index, which increased by 5.3 per cent in Q4:2020, dipped by 1.1 per cent in Q1:2021. In 2021, real GDP is expected to register a strong rebound following the record contraction in the previous year. The actual outcome will depend on how the race against the virus and its mutations is won. Inflation concerns are creeping up at a time when both monetary and fiscal policies are highly accommodative, there are promises of continued low rates for long and demand is recovering. If rising inflation and consequent movements in the bond markets lead to large valuation shifts in equity and other financial markets, it could lead to extreme volatility in global financial markets which could then spill over to emerging economies and impede the nascent global recovery. Monetary authorities in major advanced economies need to remain vigilant to these developments and be sensitive to the spillovers of their policies to the rest of the world. ", "file10": "The global economy plunged into its deepest contraction in living memory in April-June 2020 as COVID-19 took its toll. In India, real GDP fell by a record low. Supply bottlenecks and higher taxes pushed inflation above the upper tolerance band of the target. Downside risks from a delayed vaccine, persistence of supply bottlenecks, volatile international financial markets and high food inflation acquiring a structural character are clear and present dangers to the macroeconomic outlook. The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered the setting and conduct of monetary policy across the world. With the global economy having plunged into its deepest contraction in living memory in Q2:2020, with over 3.5 crore infections, including 10.4 lakh confirmed deaths as on October 7, 2020, with massive supply disruptions and demand destruction from employment and income losses on a scale not seen before, the unconventional has become conventional in the ethos of monetary policy making. Central banks have gone where they have feared to tread before: below the so-called zero lower bound on interest rates; to the outer limits of quantitative and credit easing and beyond. They have undertaken what even until recently they considered as the commission of original sins \u2013 the monetisation of fiscal deficits and the management of yield curves. Central bank communication has also turned a radical corner. Ultra-accommodative stances and more policy actions to fight the pandemic have been assured into the foreseeable future, even at the cost of volatility in financial markets shaken by this resolve, and untoward currency movements. This unprecedented monetary policy activism appears to have put equally unprecedented fiscal stimuli in the shade. in demand and production cuts, before softening in September on concerns arising out of the surge in new infections. Gold prices remained elevated as heightened uncertainty continues to boost its safe haven appeal. Inflation, too, has rebounded, although it remains well below targets in advanced economies (AEs), but has risen more strongly on food prices in some emerging market economies (EMEs). The efficacy of these actions in reconstructing economic activity from the ravages of COVID-19 is yet to gain traction on a broad scale. In several economies, rebounds from troughs have begun in Q3, but the resurgence of infections and the lingering risk of a second wave in the absence of the elusive vaccine overshadows these early signs of revival, and contractions persist in several sectors. The balance of risks remains slanted to the downside. The next few quarters can be challenging. Global public debt is projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at over 100 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020. The G20 has supported time-bound suspension of the debt service obligations of the poorest countries. Model-based projections suggest that it could take several years for output and activity to recover to pre-pandemic levels in view of the lasting impact on potential output from the loss of human and physical capital. In the event, their combined impulses have eased financial conditions substantially, helped buoy up global financial markets, and have driven up asset and commodity prices to a point widely regarded as a disconnect with the real economy. Crude oil prices have recovered since May on a gradual rise In India, with the second highest caseload in the world \u2013 over 67 lakh infections including 1 lakh deaths as of October 7, 2020, the highest daily infections, the severest lockdown in the world during April-May, and re-clamping of containment measures and localised lockdowns thereafter as infections surged into the interior, real GDP fell by a record 23.9 per cent year- on-year (y-o-y) in Q1:2020-21 (April-June 2020). Private consumption and investment slumped precipitously, only partly cushioned by government spending. On the supply side, industry as well as services sectors recorded deep contractions, and only agriculture exhibited resilience. Meanwhile, supply bottlenecks exacerbated by social distancing and higher taxes pushed up inflation sharply, with pressures evident in prices of both food and non-food items. At 6.7 per cent in August, consumer price index (CPI) inflation was ruling above the upper tolerance band of the inflation target, posing testing challenges for the conduct of monetary policy, going forward. growth for 2020-21 was expected to be negative. In these conditions, the recovery of the economy assumed primacy, but the MPC noted that the headline CPI prints of April-May 2020 required more clarity as the National Statistical Office (NSO) had to resort to imputations for many items as data collection was affected by the lockdowns. Given the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook and taking into consideration the extremely weak state of the economy in the midst of the unprecedented shock from the pandemic, the MPC decided unanimously that it was prudent to pause and remain watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space to support the revival of the economy. All members also voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met off-cycle on May 20-22, 2020 advancing its scheduled meeting in view of the exigencies imposed by COVID-19. The MPC noted that various sectors of the economy were experiencing more acute stress than initially anticipated and financial conditions needed further easing to prevent the deep distress in the economy, especially among the vulnerable and disadvantaged. While the inflation outlook remained uncertain, the forecast of a normal monsoon, subdued international commodity prices, deficient demand and favourable base effects offered some policy space. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to cut the policy repo rate by 40 basis points (bps) to 4.0 per cent (5 members voted for a reduction of 40 bps while one member voted for a reduction of 25 bps) on top of the sizeable cut of 75 bps in its March 27 off-cycle meeting. The MPC\u2019s voting pattern reflects the diversity in individual members\u2019 assessments, expectations and policy preferences, a feature that is also reflected in voting patterns of other central banks (Table I.1). Inflation surprised on the upside in the run up to the August 2020 meeting of the MPC. The persistence of supply chain disruptions and broad-based cost-push pressures were seen as keeping inflation elevated in Q2:2020-21 with some moderation only in H2:2020- 21, aided by large favourable base effects. Real GDP Chapters analyse macroeconomic developments during H1:2020-21 (April-September). For the projections set out in this Chapter, the evolution of key macroeconomic and financial variables over the past six months warrants revisions in the baseline assumptions made in the April 2020 MPR (Table I.2). First, global crude prices have remained volatile on COVID-19-related uncertainty. An unprecedented spike occurred on April 20 when, for the first time ever, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) front month prices turned negative (US$ (-) 37.6 per barrel). Supported by the agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC partners (OPEC plus) in April 2020 to cut oil production by a record 9.7 million barrels a day, Brent prices recovered from US$ 19 per barrel in April to around US$ 45 in August, before softening in September (Chart I.1). Considering these developments, crude prices (Indian basket) are assumed at US$ 40.9 in the baseline, 17 per cent above the April MPR baseline. Second, the nominal exchange rate (the Indian rupee or INR vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar) has moved in both directions since April 2020. The INR remained under Given the Covid-19 impact on revenues and expenditures and factoring in the additional borrowings announced, fiscal deficits are expected to be significantly higher Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. depreciating pressures in April due to the generalised flight out of EMEs to the safety of the US dollar amidst COVID-related concerns. After being largely range-bound during May-July, the INR exhibited an appreciating bias in August. This was driven by the surge in portfolio inflows to India on expectations of highly accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies continuing for longer, and improving prospects of potential vaccines for COVID-19. In the light of these developments, the exchange rate is assumed at INR 73.6 per US dollar in the baseline. Third, global economic activity has underperformed significantly relative to the April outlook. Global merchandise trade volumes fell by 14.3 per cent in Q2:2020 and the World Trade Organization\u2019s Goods Trade Barometer points to only partial upticks in Q3. The global composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) moved into expansion zone in July-September after remaining in contraction for five months, but the outlook remains uncertain in view of the resurgence in infections in some AEs and EMEs. The IMF expects the global economy to contract by 4.9 per cent in 2020 (Chart I.2), while the World Bank and the OECD have projected a decline of 5.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively. Headline CPI inflation breached the upper tolerance band of the target during June-August 2020, propelled by a broad-based propagation of strong upside pressures (Chapter II). Supply chain disruptions and higher taxes on petroleum products and other items imparted these upward pressures on inflation in spite of muted demand conditions. Data-related uncertainties, as complete coverage of markets and quotes was disrupted by lockdowns, complicate the assessment of the outlook. Looking ahead, three months ahead median inflation expectations of urban households fell by 10 bps in the September 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey while one year ahead median inflation expectations remained unchanged.1 The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate rose for both horizons vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round (Chart I.3). According to the Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey for September 2020, one year ahead inflation expectations remained at elevated level. Manufacturing firms polled in the July-September 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expected selling prices to remain unchanged in Q3:2020-21 on the back of benign input cost pressures (Chart I.4).2 The PMI for the manufacturing sector reported higher input prices in September though the rate of cost inflation softened from August 2020; output prices broadly stabilised in September after falling for five months in a row. Services sector firms 1 The Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households is conducted in 18 cities and the results of the September 2020 survey are based on responses from 5,652 households. 2 The results of the July-September 2020 round of the industrial outlook survey are based on responses from 959 companies. e t a r n o i t a \ufb02 n I f o n o i t r o p o r P also reported higher input costs due to fuel, meat and vegetables and some increase in output prices. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in September 2020 expected CPI inflation to moderate from 6.7 per cent in August 2020 to 4.2 per cent in Q4:2020-21 and 3.8 per cent in Q2:2021-22 (Chart I.5).3 Note: Net response is the difference between the respondents reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism. The range is -100 to 100. An increase/decrease in net responses in respect of the selling price is optimistic/ pessimistic, while the increase/decrease in net response in respect of the cost of raw materials is pessimistic/optimistic from the view point of respondent firms. Therefore, higher negative values for the cost of raw materials indicate higher input price pressures and vice versa. Source: Industrial Outlook Survey, RBI. A bumper rabi crop, moderate increases in minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops, a normal monsoon, sizeable buffer stocks and good water storage levels in major reservoirs augur well for the inflation outlook. At the same time, the persistence of COVID-related supply bottlenecks, higher taxes and their cost-push implications could impart upward pressures on inflation. The inflation outlook will also depend on trade policies and effective supply management measures with respect to key inflation- sensitive items. As noted in the Monetary Policy Report of April 2020, the uncertainty about the depth, spread and duration of COVID-19 can produce drastic changes in the outlook. Hence, macroeconomic forecasts are subject to large revisions with every incoming data on the pandemic. The RBI Act, however, enjoins the Reserve Bank to, inter alia, publish and explain in the MPR the forecasts of inflation for 6-18 months from the date of its publication. Taking into consideration the statutory requirements, the initial conditions, the signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from time-series and structural models, 3 33 panellists participated in the September 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of professional forecasters. CPI inflation is projected at 6.8 per cent in Q2:2020- 21; subsequently, large favourable base effects are expected to pull it down to 5.4 per cent in Q3, and 4.5 per cent in Q4 (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2020-21 are 3.2-5.9 per cent and 2.4-6.6 per cent, respectively. For 2021-22, assuming a normalisation of supply chains with the availability of effective vaccines against COVID-19, a normal monsoon, and no major exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will move in a range of 4.1-4.4 per cent. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for Q4:2021-22 are 2.5-5.8 per cent and 1.6-6.6 per cent, respectively. As explained earlier, an unusually high amount of uncertainty surrounds the inflation outlook. In particular, the persistence of the pandemic and delay in vaccine development could render projections of Note: The fan chart depicts uncertainty around the baseline projection path. The baseline projections are conditioned upon the assumptions set out in Table I.2. The thick red shaded area represents 50 per cent confidence interval, implying that there is 50 per cent probability that the actual outcome will be within the range given by the thick red shaded area.

In contrast, consumer price inflation remains elevated, suggesting that supply bottlenecks are outweighing the softening impact expected from weaker demand. These counterintuitive inflation dynamics have complicated the macroeconomic outlook. (ii) recent inflation pressures taking a more persistent path a la 2009-10; (iii) a structural component crystallising in higher fiscal deficit and public debt, with implications for the inflation outlook; and (iv) heightened volatility in capital flows and exchange rates. The Quarterly Projection Model (QPM)4 - a semi-structural, forward-looking, open economy, calibrated, gap model in the New Keynesian tradition - is used to explore these alternate scenarios. The baseline scenario assumes that the recent spike in inflation is transient, and that there is no second wave of infections. Accordingly, two alternate scenarios are explored. A favourable scenario (Scenario 1) assumes a faster normalisation of supply chains on the back of an early breakthrough in the development of vaccines. On the other hand, an adverse scenario (Scenario 2) is built on assumptions of (i) a second wave of infections, pulling down global and domestic growth even further; In Scenario 1, the faster normalisation of supply chains leads to lower output losses in 2020-21 relative to the baseline. Real GDP contracts by 7.5 per cent in this scenario vis-\u00e0-vis the baseline of 9.5 per cent (Chart I.1.1). The GDP growth rebound in 2021-22 is stronger at 11.6 per cent in this benign scenario relative to 10.1 per cent in the baseline. Favourable base effects, normal supply chains and anchored inflation expectations contribute 4 Benes, Jaromir, et al. (2016), \u201cQuarterly Projection Model for India: Key Elements and Properties\u201d, RBI Working Paper Series, No. 08/2016. to a reduction in inflation from 4.1 per cent in the baseline to 4.0 per cent in Q4:2021-22, aligning it with the target. In the adverse case (Scenario 2), real GDP records a deeper contraction in 2020-21 (-11.5 per cent) and the recovery is tepid in 2021-22 (7.2 per cent). Persistent supply distortions, pressures on operating costs and unhinged expectations keep inflation elevated, more than offsetting the impact of weak demand conditions both in 2020-21 and 2021-22. Volatile capital flows and downward pressure on the exchange rate add to pressure on inflation, keeping it at 5.9 per cent in Q4:2021-22, close to the upper tolerance band, and 1.8 percentage points above the baseline. Overall, this scenario brings to the fore the trade-offs between the inflation objective and that of stabilising output. Real GDP declined by an unprecedented 23.9 per cent in Q1:2020-21 and domestic economic activity remains badly hit by the unrelenting pandemic. High frequency indicators, which were looking up in June with the phased unlocking of the economy, levelled off in July amidst re-imposition of local lockdowns due to a surge in fresh cases. In August, some indicators started improving again and strengthened in September. The agricultural sector remains a bright spot, supported by a normal monsoon, robust kharif sowing and adequate reservoir levels. The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rojgar Yojana and increased wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) are also supporting rural demand. On the other hand, urban demand remains weak. Indicators relating to industry and services present a mixed picture. Turning to the forward-looking surveys, consumer confidence for the year ahead improved in the September 2020 improved sentiments on the general economic situation, the employment scenario and income (Chart I.7).5 The current situation index, however, fell to an all-time low in September 2020. round, driven by Sentiments in the manufacturing sector for the quarter ahead bounced back into the expansion zone in the July-September 2020 round of the Reserve 5 The survey is conducted by the Reserve Bank in 13 major cities and the September 2020 round is based on responses from 5,364 respondents.

Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, reflecting optimism on the overall business situation, production, order books, employment, exports and capacity utilisation (Chart I.8). Surveys by other agencies indicate a mixed picture on future business expectations (Table I.3). According to the PMI for September 2020, the one year ahead business expectations of firms in the manufacturing sector strengthened on hopes of improvement in demand, while the expectations of firms in the services sector also turned somewhat optimistic after four months of negative or neutral sentiment. Professional forecasters polled in the September 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey expected real GDP growth to remain in negative territory through Q3:2020-21, with a sharp pick up in Q1:2021-22 driven by base effects (Chart I.9 and Table I.4). Overall, the uncertainty about COVID-19\u2019s spread and trajectory continues to fog the outlook and makes forecasts of real GDP growth extremely challenging. The baseline assumes that economic activity will gradually normalise in H2:2020-21, but a wide range of outcomes is possible. Taking into account the baseline assumptions, the survey indicators, and model forecasts, real GDP is projected to contract by 9.5 per cent in 2020-21, with risks tilted to the downside: (-)9.8 per cent in Q2, (-)5.6 per cent in Q3 Note: The fan chart depicts uncertainty around the baseline projection path.

Sources: RBI staff estimates; and Survey of Professional Forecasters (September 2020). with the availability of effective vaccines, a normal monsoon, no major exogenous or policy shocks and a large favourable base effect, structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 10.1 per cent. In such an environment, the significant monetary accommodation already provided through cuts in the policy repo rate, and ample liquidity infusion through conventional and unconventional measures and fiscal stimulus and other structural reform measures announced by the government would be expected to add to the upside. On the other hand, a more protracted spread of the pandemic, delayed development and availability of vaccines, deviations from the forecast of a normal monsoon in 2021- 22 and global financial market volatility are the key downside risks. The recent inflation elevation acquiring a persistent character also poses downside risks to the baseline. The baseline projections of inflation and growth are conditional on the assumptions relating to the key variables set out in the preceding sections. assumptions, Uncertainties especially relating to COVID-19, could lead to large deviations in either direction. This section assesses the balance of risks to the baseline projections in plausible alternative scenarios. surrounding The global output losses from COVID-19 have turned out to be more severe than anticipated, despite sizeable monetary and fiscal stimuli by many countries. Given the spread of the pandemic and recurrent bouts of resurgence, the recovery is expected to be protracted and there are large downside risks to the baseline assumptions. In such a scenario, the quarterly projection model\u2019s simulations suggest that if global growth slips by 100 bps vis-\u00e0-vis the baseline, domestic growth and inflation could be lower by around 40 bps and 20 bps, respectively, from the baseline trajectories. Conversely, an early breakthrough in the development of an effective COVID-19 vaccine and its widespread distribution could boost global trade and demand. In this scenario, assuming global growth surprises by 100 bps on the upside, domestic growth and inflation could edge Crude prices rebounded from May 2020 on the back of supply cuts by oil producing countries (OPEC plus) and improved demand prospects due to the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions. Looking ahead, international crude prices may increase more than expected in the event of a quicker containment of COVID-19, a sharper global recovery or an agreement among suppliers on further production cuts. For a net energy importer like India, the dynamics of international crude price movements have significant macroeconomic implications. Assuming crude prices are 10 per cent higher, inflation could increase by 30 bps and growth could be weaker by around 20 bps over the baseline. Conversely, crude prices could soften from the current levels if the agreed production cuts are not adhered to or a second wave of the pandemic further weakens the demand for oil. In this event, if crude prices fall by 10 per cent, inflation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 20 bps to growth (Charts I.11a and I.12a). t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P The INR has exhibited two-way movements over the past six months, reflecting global risk-on risk- off sentiments driven by vacillating views on the spread and containment of COVID-19. A renewed infections and safe haven surge demand could induce capital outflows across EMEs, putting depreciation pressure on the INR. If the INR depreciates by 5 per cent from the baseline, inflation could edge up by around 20 bps and GDP growth could be higher by 15 bps (Charts I.11b and I.12b). On the other hand, if COVID-19 normalises quicker than assumed under the baseline, strong capital inflows could put appreciating pressure on the INR. In such a scenario, if the INR appreciates by 5 per cent, inflation and GDP growth could moderate by around 20 bps and 15 bps, respectively, vis-\u00e0-vis the baseline. Food inflation has remained elevated in recent months driven by price pressures in vegetables, cereals and protein items such as pulses, eggs and meat. The normal south-west monsoon, increased sowing of kharif crops, moderate MSP hikes, and high reservoir storage are expected to soften food inflation going forward. However, a delayed normalisation of supply chains, heavy rains and floods in some states and demand-supply imbalances in key items such as pulses could exert further upward pressure on the headline inflation and keep it higher by around 50 bps (Charts I.11b and I.12b). On the other hand, an accelerated softening of food inflation due to an early restoration of supply chains, ample buffer stocks and efficient food stock management by the Government could bring headline inflation below the baseline by up to 50 bps. At this juncture, global outlook is heavily contingent upon the uncertain trajectory of COVID-19, with significant implications for key variables such as crude oil and commodity prices, global growth, and financial markets. Consequently, the forecasts for domestic inflation and output could change significantly relative to baseline expectations. The behaviour of inflation holds the key to the conduct of monetary policy going forward. The gradual restoration of supply lines, good progress of kharif sowing, sizeable buffer stocks, effective food supply management and a faster progress on the vaccine could pull inflation down from current elevated levels and open up space for addressing the urgent need to repair and revive the economy from the blows it has suffered from the pandemic. Yet, the downside risks from a delayed vaccine, more than expected persistence of supply bottlenecks, volatile international financial markets and high food inflation acquiring a structural character and spilling to non-food items are clear and present dangers that could potentially push inflation above the baseline. By current assessment, real GDP growth can post a modest recovery during H2:2020-21, aided by early containment of COVID-19 and the monetary and fiscal stimuli. Nonetheless, it is prudent to recognise and brace up for the downside risks described earlier. A broad-based elevation in consumer price index (CPI) inflation between March and July 2020 emanated from tight demand supply balances in protein-based food items, floods damaging the output of vegetables, increase in retail margins due to the pandemic, tax increases in petrol and diesel, safe haven demand for gold and cost-push pressures. At the time of the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of April 2020, headline inflation1, which was ruling above the upper tolerance level of the inflation target, was projected to decline, with rabi crop arrivals inducing a softening of food inflation. COVID-19 has drastically altered that prognosis. The pandemic and the response in the form of social distancing and the severest lockdown in the world caused a virtual seizure of transactions in non-essential items and threw into complete disarray the price collection system. The National Statistical Office (NSO) suspended the publication of the headline consumer price index (CPI) for April and May. It was not until July 13, 2020 with the lifting of some pandemic-related restrictions and the partial restoration of non-essential activities that the provisional index for June 2020 could be compiled. Even so, prices could be collected from 1030 urban markets and 998 villages that accounted for only 88 per cent of the total sample. As such, the data collected did not meet the adequacy criteria for generating robust estimates of CPI at the state level. Headline indices for April and May were imputed for business continuity purposes. In its resolution of August 6, 2020, the monetary policy committee (MPC) expressed the view that for the purpose of monetary policy formulation and conduct, the imputed prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series. In terms of acceptable standards of data collection, it is appropriate to compare the headline inflation reading for July 2020 with that of March 2020. The surge in inflation by 90 basis points between these reference dates was diffused across the board, partly offset by a significant moderation in fuel inflation (Chart II.1). 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year changes in all India CPI Combined (Rural and Urban). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934 (amended in 2016) enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections, if any, and explain the underlying reasons thereof. The April 2020 MPR had projected a moderation in CPI inflation during H1:2020-21 from 6.6 per cent in Q4:2019-20 to 4.8 per cent in Q1:2020-21 and to 4.4 per cent in Q2:2020-21, with the caveat that the uncertainty about the depth, spread and duration of COVID-19 could produce drastic changes in these forecasts. With data for Q1 being regarded as a break in the CPI series as cited above, actual inflation outcomes overshot projections by 2.3 percentage points in Q2 (Chart II.2), largely reflecting the destructive impact of COVID-19. Price spikes became evident in April during the nation-wide lockdown as usurious margins chased panic buying and stocking. Although there was some ebbing in May, these price pressures resurfaced in June and persisted in July-August due to a variety of shocks: an increase in the prices of vegetables due to floods in eastern India; elevated edible oils prices on the back of higher international prices; pressures on meat and fish prices once the initial apprehension of their link with COVID-19 infections was allayed; and supply bottlenecks in the availability of cereals and pulses. From February 2020, international gold prices increased to historic highs on safe haven demand, pushing up prices of personal care and effects by around 10 per cent. International crude oil prices jumped from US $35 per barrel assumed in the April MPR to US $44 per barrel by end-August. Domestic petrol and diesel pump prices rose more than proportionately in view of the sharp increase in excise duties on petrol and diesel by `10 per litre and `13 per litre, respectively, and state VAT by up to `7 per litre in the post-lockdown period. Inflation excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel and gold from the CPI edged up as costs associated with disruption of supply chains, labour shortages and transportation fed into a host of goods and services. Overall, the supply shocks caused by COVID-19 overwhelmed the collapse in demand. #: The NSO did not publish inflation rates for April and May 2020. *: Projections for entire Q2:2020-21 vis-a-vis actual average inflation during July-August 2020. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. A decomposition of changes in year-on-year (y-o-y) inflation2 indicates that the sharp increase in headline inflation between March and July was the result of a substantial and broad-based jump in price momentum. By August, the price momentum moderated across food and core groups, and declined in respect of the fuel group; however, favourable base effects across food and core also diminished in August, resulting in headline inflation remaining broadly unchanged at 6.7 per cent during July and August (Chart II.3). 2 A change in CPI year-on-year (y-o-y) inflation between any two months is the difference between the current month-on-month (m-o-m) change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. d: CPI excluding Food and Fuel The distribution of CPI inflation over January-August 20203 reveals that the median inflation rate shifted up to 4.6 per cent from around 4 per cent in recent years, indicating a broad-based increase in price pressures (Chart II.4). The diffusion indices of price changes in CPI items4 on a non-seasonally adjusted basis5 also attest to this cross-sectional spread of price increases in the post-lockdown period (Chart II.5). A historical decomposition in a vector autoregression (VAR) framework can help to disentangle the relative role of various factors driving the inflation process. This empirical analysis indicates the predominant role of unfavourable supply side shocks in keeping inflation at elevated levels in recent quarters. Food supply and crude oil price shocks together contributed 3 Excluding April-May 2020 imputed inflation data. 4 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. A reading above 50 for the diffusion index signals a broad expansion or generalisation of price increases and a reading below 50 signals broad-based price decline. 5 The non-availability of CPI item level data for the period March-May 2020 hindered seasonal adjustments in the item level series for the recent period. around 80 per cent of the deviation in inflation from target in Q2:2020-21 (Chart II.6a). Muted demand conditions contributed negatively to the inflation deviation by around 10 per cent in Q2 but were dwarfed by the supply-side shocks. The sizeable repo rate cuts, expansion in money supply and the firming up of equity prices \u2013 representing asset prices \u2013 together contributed around 10 per cent to the inflation deviation in Q2.6 6 Historical decomposition is used to estimate the individual impact of shocks on movements in inflation over a sample period, based on a vector auto regression (VAR). The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et; where et represents a vector of shocks [oil price shock; exchange rate shock; asset price shock; supply shock (inflation shock); demand shock; wage shock; policy rate shock; and money supply shock]. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. The supply shocks represent the unexplained component of the CPI inflation. Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI. prices also contributed to the surge (Chart II.7b). Inflation in prices of oils and fats and spices was in June-August 2020, remained elevated at 46.8 per cent double digits in H1:2020-21 creating another pressure due to supply disruptions.

These spikes generally occur in the lean months of July-September during which the entire domestic supply is met through onions procured in the rabi season. With the arrival of the late kharif crop and a large rabi crop, onion prices went into deflation of (-) 4.0 per cent in August 2020. Inflation in onion prices surged from September 2019 onwards and reached a peak of 327.4 per cent in December 2019, contributing 4.8 percentage points to food inflation and 2.1 percentage points to headline Prices of tomatoes picked up during June-July 2020 due to lower supplies coming from damage to crops in some regions from pre-monsoon rains.

Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. evidence suggests that farmers in some states/areas planted less area with tomatoes than a year ago due to the collapse of prices in major centres in May 2020, which might have also contributed to the spike in prices in July. Tomato prices eased slightly in August 2020, with fresh supplies coming into the market. 2019-20 over 2018-19 final estimates) and especially, urad production (by 44.9 per cent) led to persistent price pressures, which were accentuated by lockdown- related supply uncertainties and stockpiling by consumers during April-May 2020. With the easing of the lockdown and improved kharif sowing, pulses inflation eased to 14.4 per cent in August. Inflation in prices of fruits (weight of 2.9 per cent in the CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages group) declined from a peak of 5.8 per cent in January 2020 to 0.1 per cent in July 2020 but picked up to 1.0 per cent in August 2020 due to higher demand for dry fruits during the pandemic. Within protein-based food items (weight of 13.0 per cent in the CPI and 28.4 per cent in the food and beverages group), inflation in prices of pulses (weight of 2.4 per cent in the CPI and 5.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) exhibits a cobweb phenomenon \u2013 lower production and higher prices in a deficit season spur increased acreage in the following season, leading to excess supply and consequent fall in prices. In the short-run, demand- supply mismatches are met mainly through imports, the transit time varying and imposing volatility (Chart II.10). The decline in kharif pulses production (by 4.6 per cent in the 4th advance estimates for Inflation in prices of meat and fish (weight of 3.6 per cent in the CPI and 7.9 per cent within the food and beverages group) increased from 9.2 per cent in March to 18.9 per cent in June 2020 before moderating to 16.5 per cent in August 2020. Prices of chicken and eggs eased during February-March 2020 due to a fall in consumption demand on pandemic fears, with poultry farmers culling to avoid feeding costs. With demand recovering from May, inflation in prices of chicken rose to 25.4 per cent in June 2020 while inflation in prices of eggs increased to 10.1 per cent in August 2020. With the onset of the rainy season, prices of mutton, fish and chicken eased as per the usual seasonal pattern in July-August 2020. Milk and products price inflation (weight of 6.6 per cent in the CPI and 14.4 per cent in the food and beverages group), which were impacted by price hikes by major co-operatives last year (in May 2019 and December 2019), remained elevated at 6.2 per cent in August due to supply disruptions. Higher global prices of skimmed milk products also impacted domestic prices. Inflation in prices of sugar and confectionery (weight of 1.4 per cent in the CPI and 3.0 per cent in the food and beverages group) moderated from 3.9 per cent in March to 2.9 per cent in June due to the decline in demand from bulk segments (hotels and restaurants). In July 2020, Andhra Pradesh increased the PDS sugar prices from `20 per kg to `34 per kg imparting pressures to both PDS and non-PDS sugar prices. Inflation in prices of oils and fats (weight of 3.6 per cent in the CPI and 7.8 per cent in the food and beverages group) increased in January 2020 and remained elevated, reaching 12.4 per cent in August Inflation in fuel prices moderated from 6.4 per cent in February 2020 to 0.5 per cent in June due to a steep fall in domestic LPG and kerosene prices in tandem with the collapse in international benchmark product prices (Chart II.11a). Subsidised domestic kerosene prices firmed up till March and the domestic kerosene price was higher than international prices for the first time. Accordingly, oil marketing companies (OMCs) stopped the calibrated increase in administered kerosene prices from April and linked them to international prices movements with price revisions at the start of every month. As a result, domestic kerosene prices fell sharply during April-May, tracking international prices. By July 2020, international prices reversed, and domestic LPG and kerosene prices edged up (Chart II.11b and Chart II.11c). Prices of items of rural fuel consumption registered some moderation in the post- lockdown period, but the contribution of electricity prices to overall fuel inflation increased (Chart II.11a). CPI inflation excluding food and fuel (core inflation) rose from 3.9 per cent in February-March 2020 to 5.6 per cent in July-August (Chart II.12). This price build-up was much higher than the historical average (Chart II.13).

International crude oil prices plummeted after the imposition of lockdowns globally, pulling down the price of Indian basket of crude oil to around US$ 16 per barrel on April 21, 2020. Thereafter, the Indian basket crude oil price increased to US$ 44 per barrel by end-August 2020. With the incidence of higher taxes, domestic petrol pump prices9 increased from `72.4 per litre at end-March to `84.8 per litre by end-August (Chart II.14a). On May 6, 2020, the central government raised the excise duty on petrol and diesel again10 by `10 per litre and `13 per litre, respectively. There was, however, no commensurate increase in the pump prices, as it was absorbed into the large mark- up over international prices.11 Faced with large Note: International petrol prices denote the spot price of Singapore gasoline.

Coupled with the increase in international prices, this pushed up domestic pump prices sharply during June. CPI petrol inflation jumped from 3.2 per cent in February to 12.1 per cent in August 2020. On the other hand, inflation in respect of wholesale prices of petrol and diesel, which captures prices net of any tax impact, moved from (-) 1.5 per cent in February to (-) 33.4 per cent in May and to (-) 14.2 per cent in August, broadly mirroring international price movements (Chart II.14b). Even abstracting from the effects of prices of petroleum products, CPI inflation excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel increased from 4.0 per cent in February to 5.4 per cent in July-August 2020. A major contributor was the increase in gold prices to historic highs by August 2020. CPI inflation excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver also increased from 3.6 per cent in February 2020 to 4.5 per cent in July-August 2020, indicating broad-based cost-push pressures in the post- lockdown period that were more acute in urban areas than in rural areas (Box II.1). Inflation in the prices of goods component of CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver (with a weight of 20.7 per cent in CPI) rose from 2.9 per cent in February 2020 to 4.7 per cent in August Box II.1: Whose Inflation is It? The Rural-Urban Divide Compilation of all-India CPI entails a bottom-up aggregation process, starting from state-wise price indices for rural and urban areas. Any inflation impulse at the national level has thus an underlying rural-urban distinction as was evident in the onion price shock of November 2019-February 2020 and the COVID-19 related lockdown shock of June-August 2020. The former saw similar inflation distributions in the rural and urban areas with fat tails due to spike in vegetable inflation, whereas the rural-urban inflation distributions showed divergence post lockdown (Chart II.1.1). During June-August, 2020 urban inflation was predominantly concentrated in the non-food sub-groups. Inflation in the prices of household goods and services was higher in urban areas by 2.9 percentage points. On the other hand, rural areas saw substantially higher the post-lockdown period vegetables (Chart II.1.2). In the past, these divergences have been short-lived; over time, there is an inherent tendency for rural and urban inflation to converge and this is reflected in data for most recent months (Bhoi et al., 2020). An 12 During April-May 2020, VAT on petrol was increased in a range of `1 per litre to `3.25 per litre while that on diesel was increased in a range of `1 per litre to `7.10 per litre in the four metropolitan cities (Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata). On July 31, 2020, Delhi reduced the VAT on diesel, effectively reducing its prices by `8.4 per litre. empirical exercise using fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), based on monthly inflation data for January 2012-July 2020 confirms a co-integrating relationship, i.e., there exists a long-run co-movement between rural and urban inflation at the all-India level.

Thereafter, a Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. further moderation in inflation in the food group, coupled with disinflation in the clothing group, kept CPI-IW (Chart II.16a). Inflation in terms of the wholesale price index (WPI) was on a different trail altogether. It sank into deflation in April, which persisted through till July, with non-food manufactured products in deflation for over a year. Fuel inflation moved into negative territory in March 2020 as a result of the large contraction in mineral oil inflation during March that persisted till August 2020. In August, WPI inflation turned marginally positive (0.2 per cent) due to a sharp uptick in inflation in non-food manufactured products. WPI food inflation remained above 4 per cent but exhibited lower inflationary pressures than in CPI across major sub-groups (Charts II.16b). The WPI measures basic prices less trade discounts, thereby leaving out indirect taxes by definition while retail prices are inclusive of taxes. Gross domestic product (GDP) and gross value added (GVA) deflators sank in Q1:2020-21 in line with the WPI. exclusion-based measures have moved up \u2013 barring a slight reversal in August \u2013 suggesting generalised inflationary pressures (Charts II.12 and II.17). The wholesale cost of farm inputs and industrial raw materials entered into deflationary territory in March and dipped to a 55-month low in May 2020, mirroring soft global oil and other commodity prices, and subdued demand (Chart II.18). There was a moderation in coal inflation, given low demand from end-user industries for steel and power, and contraction in international coal prices. Among other non-food items, deflation in prices of fibres intensified during April-August 2020 on account of subdued exports and domestic demand. Trimmed means of inflation provide a measure of underlying inflation dynamics and are computed by statistically eliminating large positive and negative changes. Exclusion based measures of CPI also capture persistent trends in inflation by removing volatile components. Both trimmed means and Amongst farm sector inputs, inflation in the case of fodder prices moderated during June-August 2020, owing to the early onset and good distribution of monsoon. In the case of fertilisers and pesticides, inflation remained muted, reflecting deflation in international prices of phosphate, di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), triple superphosphate (TSP) and urea. Electricity prices have eased since April in view Growth in nominal rural wages, both for agricultural and non-agricultural labourers, showed a sharp uptick in May 202013 (Chart II.19). of weak demand conditions. Inflation in agricultural machinery and implements eased to 1.2 per cent during April-August 2020 due to subdued momentum in prices of tractors and agriculture implements. Growth in staff costs in the organised sector decreased for listed firms in the manufacturing and services sectors during Q1:2020-21 over layoffs and salary cuts. However, unit labour costs (measured as a ratio of staff cost to value of production) increased during Q1:2020-21 due to contraction in the value of production14. Unit labour cost rose from 6.8 per cent in Q4:2019-20 to 10.2 per cent in Q1:2020-21 for firms in the manufacturing sector15 and from 29.2 per cent to 35.5 per cent for firms in the services sector16 (Chart II.20). Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey reported higher input cost pressures during Q2:2020-21 owing to supply shortages and transport delays (Chart II.21).

Data collection remained constrained for May 2020 as well. 14 The results hold for the common set of companies also: unit labour cost for common 1521 manufacturing firms increased from 6.9 per cent in Q4:2019-20 to 10.2 per cent in Q1:2020-21 and for common 543 services firms increased from 31.0 per cent to 38.0 per cent. 15 Provisional estimate based on 1601 manufacturing firms 16 Provisional estimate based on 613 services firms. expected to increase further in Q3. The cost of finance remained subdued. Reflecting cost pressures, selling prices edged up in Q2 and are expected to firm up further in Q4 and Q1:2021-22. Households\u2019 inflation expectations, as polled in the September 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, remained elevated but eased modestly over the three-months ahead horizon. Manufacturing as well as services firms polled for the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) reported sharp declines in both input cost and selling prices during Q1:2020-21. In August-September 2020, input prices for the manufacturing firms registered an uptick as raw material costs, particularly for iron and steel, rose. Output prices, however, remained tepid and broadly stabilised in September after declining for five months in a row. For services firms, higher fuel and food prices pushed up input costs during Q2:2020-21, leading to a soft uptick in selling prices in August-September. Inflationary pressures have firmed up in H1 on supply shocks and cost push pressures brought about by COVID-19. In this situation, proactive supply side management holds the key to containment of price pressures within broader supply side reforms. Timely and adequate release of cereal stocks including sales, meeting shortfalls in the availability of pulses through imports, rationalisation of the import duty structure for pulses and for edible oils for which around two-thirds of domestic demand is met by imports, steps to fully restore supply chains for poultry, goat and sheep, and adequate procurement and buffer stocks for stabilisation of vegetables prices, particularly key vegetables like onions and potatoes are the main elements of this approach. Furthermore, the high level of taxes on petroleum products needs to be revisited to ameliorate cost push pressures as the economy recovers. Effective supply side interventions and the presence of large favourable base effects are expected to bring about a moderation in inflation in H2:2020-21 but the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 trajectory pose substantial risks to the outlook. In absence of sufficient supply-side responses, the risk of cost push pressures translating to a generalised increase in inflation and its persistence is a serious threat to the evolving macroeconomic outlook. After an unprecedented decline in fixed investment, private consumption and exports in Q1:2020-21, aggregate demand recorded sequential improvement in Q2 on the back of robust rural demand and some uptick in urban consumption. On the supply side, the steep decline in manufacturing and plummeting construction activity in Q1 was followed by a gradual easing of contraction in Q2. In the period following the release of the April 2020 MPR, economic activity plunged into a contraction in Q1:2020-21 that is unparalleled in India\u2019s history. The combined impact of demand compression and supply disruptions has produced an unprecedented decline in fixed investment, private consumption and exports. Government expenditure, including in the form of counter-pandemic measures, has cushioned the deterioration. Without it, the downturn would have been even deeper. On the supply side, the stringent nation-wide lockdown, social distancing norms and the mass exodus of migrant workers led to a steep decline in manufacturing and plummeting construction activity. Trade and transportation went down to a fraction of their pre-COVID-19 levels. Credit conditions also remained muted. The only silver lining was the resilience of agriculture and allied activities on the back of record production of rabi and horticulture crops in 2019-20. The bountiful and widespread southwest monsoon in the 2020 season and higher kharif sowing have brightened the outlook for rural consumption. With the gradual unlocking of the economy from May/June 2020, signs of stabilisation appeared but the resurgence of infections especially in the interior part of the country levelled them off in July. High frequency indicators exhibited signs of some recovery again in August, which strengthened in September 2020. The August 2020 data release of the National (NSO) revealed that aggregate Statistical Office demand measured in terms of year-on-year changes in real gross domestic product (GDP) underwent a contraction of 23.9 per cent in Q1:2020-21, taking GDP to its lowest in the history of the quarterly series (Table III.1 and Chart III.1a).

Moreover, excluding expenditure tapered off in August after robust growth in July, it strengthened in later part of September with additional support from supplementary demands of `1.67 lakh crore by the central government. would have slumped by 29.3 per cent. In Q2, aggregate demand recorded sequential and non-durable consumer goods, have exhibited passenger vehicles sales emerged out of contraction durables is still high. We can not say that a revival has taken place, while domestic air passenger traffic trailed below pre-COVID levels. In Q2, investment remained subdued, as reflected in coincident indicators \u2013 steel and imports of capital goods. The record issuance Nowcasting \u2013 the prediction of the present or the very near future of the state of the economy \u2013 has become popular among central banks in the face of long lags and frequent revisions in official measures of economic activity. Historically, nowcasting techniques have been based on simplified heuristic approaches, but more recently, they rely on statistical approaches to produce predictions that eliminate the need for informal judgement. Nowcast models can exploit information from a large quantity of data series at different frequencies and with different publication lags to extract signals from noise on economic activity1. Methods based on social media content have also been developed to estimate hidden sentiment analysis on the 'mood' of a population. Regression- based approaches, mixed data sampling, Bayesian approaches and dynamic factor models are now being employed to improve the forecasting power of nowcasting models. financing conditions remain congenial for enabling In this context, a dynamic factor model using 27 the lockdown. The recovery has been more rapid for monthly indicators grouped2 under industry, services, industry, however, and slower for services, pointing index of economic activity (IEA) plunged to -6.3 in April and moderated to -2.4 in September 2020 after a hotels; restaurants; recreation) remain sluggish in the face of continuing health risks.

Nowcasting exercises offer rich scope of refinement to enhance predictive efficiency by augmenting existing models with spatial and real-time indicators on a daily basis that are becoming available, including through the application of machine learning tools, web scraping and artificial intelligence (Box III.1). Indicators with monthly frequency such as electricity consumption, industrial activity, automobile sales, cargo handling and air passenger traffic are used to monitor economic activity in normal times. In a pandemic environment, however, monitoring economic activity in real time becomes critical to draw appropriate inferences for nimble-footed policy decisions. In this context, coincident indices (CIs) based on high frequency data have been employed by combining indicators over time and space (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia4 and Federal Bank of New York5). In the Indian context, a CI is constructed with four indicators representing a mix of demand and supply dynamics and based on availability of data at daily frequency at the state level: (i) total vehicle registrations [Vahan dashboard of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH), Government of India]; (ii) electricity (Power System Operation Corporation consumption Limited); (iii) air quality index (Central Pollution Control Board); and iv) Google and Apple mobility data. Y-o-Y growth in these indicators, standardised with the year 2019 as base, reflect movements in consumer demand, activity in trade and transportation, commercial and industrial activity, agricultural and domestic energy demand, manufacturing activity and movements of the labour force. The choice of states for the construction of the CI is largely based on data availability. Accordingly, data from 14 states were used, accounting for 81 per cent of total national GVA. A dynamic factor model (DFM)6 is applied using the factor analyser module of Python. 6 In the DFM, the N variables (i = 1, \u2026, N) are assumed to be the sum of two unobservable orthogonal components, viz. common factors for the set of variables (yit), and an idiosyncratic component (zit) at each time period t = 1,\u2026T. The component (yit) is obtained by extracting r common factors (Fjt), j = 1,\u2026, r from all variables in the data set while the idiosyncratic component (zit) covers the shocks specific to each variable. Thus, a dynamic factor model can be represented as: xit = \u03bbi1F1t + \u2026.. + \u03bbirFrt + zit where \u03bbij for i = 1, \u2026 , N and j = 1,\u2026, r, are factor loadings relating the data xit to r latent common factors. The CI shows that all regions experienced sharp fall in the cyclical component of economic activity in April before registering a slow recovery in the following months. The northern region registered positive momentum from mid- June but lost steam in the second half of August before gaining traction again in September. On the other hand, western and southern regions have experienced a fall in the momentum in the September after registering some signs of recovery. An All-India CI, constructed as a weighted average of state CIs by using the share of states in overall GVA as weights (Chart III.1.2), captures the collapse in activity in Q1 and a hesitant recovery in ensuing months with the gradual opening of the economy. Osborne, J. W., Costello, A. B., & Kellow, J. T. (2008), \"Best Practices in Exploratory Factor Analysis\", In J. W. Osborne (Ed.), Best Practices in Quantitative Methods, Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publishing. Private consumption, with a share of around 55 per cent in GDP, is the mainstay of aggregate demand. The destruction of consumption demand by COVID-19 can be gauged from the sheer consumption in Q1:2020-21\u2013 it fell by a third `32.5 lakh crore recorded in Q3:2019-20 ahead of the there were signs of recovery in private consumption in terms of high frequency indicators, but it is far from gaining full and broad-based traction in the face of rising infections as lockdowns are hesitantly eased. Drilling down into underlying dynamics of PFCE, it is found that though the retrenchment occurred across constituents, the contraction in private consumption seems to have been more pronounced in urban areas. Illustratively, domestic air passenger traffic and production of consumer durables remained dormant during the entire period of the lockdown (Chart III.3a & b). Turning to Q2, the recovery in this segment that became evident in May 2020 has been tepid. Although passenger vehicles sales and production of consumer durables have shown a better revival relative to domestic air passenger traffic in July and August, they still trail below pre-COVID levels. The subdued movements in household credit in the form of credit card outstanding, vehicle loans and other personal loans corroborates the muted state of urban consumption (Chart III.4). Indicators of rural demand reveal a relatively better picture. The production of consumer non-durables and sales of tractors, for instance, exhibited robust growth from June onwards (Chart III.5a and b). Rainfall in the current monsoon season has been 9 per cent above the long period average (LPA) (till September 30), which should augur well for the prospects of rural income and demand. This is also reflected in accelerated growth in fertilisers production and progress of kharif sowing. The increasing spread of COVID-19 infections into smaller towns and rural areas, however, imparts some uncertainty to the outlook, with implications for public health infrastructure in these areas. A priority, therefore, is to build on the government\u2019s relief package and offset reduction in remittance flows to rural households post the exodus of migrant workers by actions that restore jobs and livelihood. As per the order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank, capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector declined sharply to 48.2 per cent in Q1:2020-21 from Investment, which was already in contraction mode since Q2:2019-20, suffered a massive knock-on effect from the pandemic. Fixed investment shrank by 47.1 per cent in Q1:2020-21, taking its share in aggregate demand down to 22.3 per cent from 32 per cent year ago. In Q2, the investment climate remained subdued. Still muted consumption demand and excess capacity are holding back new investments, despite easing of financial conditions. Investment in dwellings, other buildings and structures, dropped precipitously under the weight of a confluence of factors working in tandem, viz., large inventory overhang in housing, tapering of incomes and hence, EMI-servicing capacity, and high stress in the balance sheets of non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs). This is also reflected in proximate coincident indicators \u2013 steel consumption; cement Note: The result of Q1:2020-21 is based on 1,601 listed private manufacturing companies and 613 listed private non-finacial services companies. Source: RBI staff estimates. 68.2 per cent in the previous quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis (Chart III.7). Manufacturing firms responding to the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2:2020-21 and to sustain through Q1:2021-22. In recent years, government expenditure has counter- cyclically supported aggregate demand as evident Meanwhile, a favourable configuration is forming to support a revival in investment appetite. Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially, with systemic liquidity in large surplus and a significant narrowing of spreads on all financial instruments, irrespective of ratings, spurring a record issuance of corporate bonds in H1:2020 relative to a year ago. Even though bank lending remains lacklustre, especially to large, medium and small industries, the mandated linking of interest rates on new floating rate loans to external benchmarks for select sectors has improved transmission of changes in policy rates to banks\u2019 lending rates (Chapter IV). Among the emerging risks, a decrease in the interest coverage ratio, indicating falling debt servicing capacity, could weigh on investment going forward (Chart III.8). GDP to support vulnerable sections of the population continues to play out, providing direct and indirect Pipeline (NIP), which involves an investment of around `111 lakh crore by 2025 in various projects governments and the private sector, could boost Government finances have come under stress due to a sharp fall in revenues. The central government\u2019s far remaining broadly in line with budget estimates. This could be attributed to the curtailment of some revenue expenditure by various state governments [e.g., dearness allowances (DA) freeze; deferment of part of full salary and wages; deduction of salary]. Going ahead, the contribution of government expenditure could taper as revenue shortfalls stretch the finances of both the central government and state governments. during April-August 2020-21 (Table III.2). This has led to some expenditure reprioritization. Accordingly, expenditure rationalisation measures have been stipulated for the ministries during Q1-Q3 to curb avoidable outgoes. The central government, however, sought parliament\u2019s nod for net additional spending of `1.67 lakh crore in 2020-21. On the other hand, states\u2019 expenditure has not shown any significant pick-up so The central government\u2019s revenue receipts were impacted during April-August 2020 by large declines in both direct and indirect tax collections (Table III.3) in all categories except union excise duties which were supported by increases in taxes on petroleum products. The decline in customs duty collections mirrored the ongoing contraction in imports. Total GST collections were severely hit by the lockdown during April-May 2020 but recovered partly during June-September 2020 (Chart III.10).In September GST collections were recorded at ` 95 thousand crore. During April-August 2020, the central government\u2019s revenue expenditure received a boost from increased agricultural, rural, and defence spending, while there were lower outgoes on major subsidies (food, fuel and fertilizers). Capital expenditure registered a A. Direct Taxes Of which 1. Corporation Tax 2. Income Tax B. Indirect Taxes Of which 1. Total GST 2. Custom Duties 3. Union Excise Duties C. Gross Tax Revenue D. Assignment to States/UTs E. Net Tax Revenue road transport and highways. With the continuing decline in private investment, a step-up in government capital expenditure could perform the twin roles of gap-fill and potential crowding-in. r p A y a M g u A c e D r a M contraction of 1.3 per cent in this period (Chart III.11). Over 75 per cent of the capital expenditure was incurred by the ministries of defence, railways, and Several states had presented their budgets before the onset of the pandemic, which implies substantial revisions as the year progresses. States\u2019 own tax revenue as well as central transfers have been adversely impacted, while pandemic-related expenditure has been heavy. In this context, the additional borrowings limits for states of up to 2 per cent of gross state domestic product (GSDP) or `4.28 lakh crore, partly linked to specific reforms7, can expand their total borrowing during 2020-21. Most states may be able to meet the first two specified reforms (viz., one-nation- one-ration-card and ease of doing business), which would allow them to borrow up to 4.0 per cent of GDP, on an average. The central government is also working out modalities to compensate states with respect to the expected shortfall of compensation cess during 2020-21. 7 It is stipulated that relaxations in borrowings limits will be partly unconditional and partly conditional to carrying out specified actions, namely 1) universalisaton of the one-nation-one-ration card system 2) ease of doing business reforms; 3) power sector reforms 4) urban local body/ utility reform: out of the 2 per cent increase, the first 0.5 per cent will be unconditional while the next 1 per cent will be divided into four equal tranches of 0.25 per cent each, with each tranche linked to reform actions in above four areas. The last 0.5 per cent of the extra borrowing will be allowed to states if milestones are completely achieved in at least three out of four reform areas. a larger proportion of their redemptions from the CSF. Given the fact that capital expenditure by states accounts for two-thirds of total capital expenditure of general government, it is imperative not to cut down capital expenditure in the coming quarters if the revival in overall economic activity has to be supported (Chart III.12 a and b). Given the stress on state finances, the Reserve Bank increased ways and means advances (WMA) limits by 60 per cent over and above the level as on March 31, 2020, which has been extended for a further period of 6 months till March 31, 2021. Rules governing withdrawals from the Consolidated Sinking Fund (CSF) scheme were relaxed to enable them to meet The limit for WMA for the centre for the first half of 2020-21 was revised upward to `2 lakh crore from `1.2 lakh crore. Furthermore, Center's WMA limit for H2:2020-21 has been kept higher at `1.25 lakh crore vis-a-vis `35,000 crore in the same period of last year. Moreover, limits for foreign portfolio investment in government securities have been expanded and a fully accessible route has been introduced for investment by non-residents in government securities without any limit. As at end-September, `7.66 Lakh crore or 63.8 per cent of the revised gross market borrowings of the central government for the full year 2020-21 has been completed (Table III.4). The central government\u2019s market borrowing calender for H2 has planned gross issuances of `4.34 Lakh crore, sticking to the revised estimate of `12 Lakh crore for the full fiscal a: Capex cut by States vis-a-vis Budgeted h s e d a r P a r h d n A h r a g s i t t a h h C t a r a j u G d n a h k r a h J h s e d a r P a y h d a M a r t h s a r a h a M r u p i n a M d n a l a g a N a s i d O b a j n u P n a h t s a j a R m i k k i S u d a N m a T a r u p i r T h s e d a r P r a t t U d n a h k a r a t t U year. States completed gross market borrowings of `3,53,596 crore during the year (up to September 30), comprising 115.8 per cent of the calendar for H1:2020-21. In spite of the deterioration of external demand, net exports contributed positively to aggregate demand in Q1:2020-21, as imports contracted faster than exports (Chart III.13). by COVID-19. Disaggregated data available for July- August 2020 suggests that among non-oil exports, the decline was pronounced in respect of gems and jewellery, engineering goods, readymade garments and electronic goods (Chart III.14a). On the other hand, exports of drugs and pharmaceuticals, iron ore and rice recorded robust growth due to increased demand even during the pandemic, underlying their innate resilience. India\u2019s exports marked a turnaround and entered positive territory in September after six months of contraction, while imports declined for the seventh consecutive month (Chart III.13a). In Q2, India\u2019s exports were US$ 73.7 billion and imports were US$ 88.3 billion. Despite limited participation, India\u2019s merchandise exports were impacted by the massive disruption in global value chains (GVCs) inflicted The decline in imports was broad-based. During July-August, 25 out of 31 major commodity groups, which accounted for 81 per cent of the import basket, witnessed contraction (Chart III.14b). A steep reduction in crude oil prices and lower domestic demand for petroleum products led to a decline in POL imports, while gold imports plunged with a slump in domestic demand and high gold prices, although a revival of investment demand for gold rekindled imports in August 2020. The decline in non-POL non-gold imports in July-August 2020 was primarily contributed by electronic goods, pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, machinery and coal, coke and briquettes. The merchandise trade deficit had narrowed substantially to US$ 9.0 billion in Q1:2020-21 from US$ 49.2 billion a year ago with the first trade surplus of US$ 0.8 billion after a gap of over eighteen years in June 2020. The trade balance, however, turned into deficit in Q2 (US$ 14.5 billion). The current account balance, which had recorded a marginal surplus of US$ 0.6 billion (0.1 per cent of GDP) in Q4:2019-20 after a gap of twelve years, posted a record surplus of US$ 19.8 billion (3.9 per cent of GDP) in Q1:2020-21. Invisible receipts moderated marginally in Q1:2020- 21, mainly due to a decline in inward remittances on account of the global recession, decline in crude oil prices and loss of employment opportunities overseas. Notwithstanding the sharp decline in travel receipts due to restrictions on tourist arrivals and a few other categories of services, net services receipts remained relatively stable due to steady software earnings, which accounted for 48 per cent of total services receipts in Q1:2020-21. Despite a fall in the overall global IT spending, software exports may remain relatively resilient with companies focusing on digital workplace support, adoption of cloud services and infrastructure modernisation in the face of pandemic challenges. Net outgo on account of investment and other income increased in Q1:2020-21, with an uptick in dividend payments on foreign equity and investment funds in India. In the financial account, portfolio flows made a gradual rebound with the renewal of risk-on sentiment. Net FPI inflows stood at US$ 8.3 billion in 2020-21 (up to October 6) as compared with US$ 2.8 billion a year ago. While the equity segment recorded inflows of US$ 11.1 billion as against outflows of US$ 0.6 billion a year ago, in the debt segment (general route), there were outflows of US$ 4.2 billion as against inflows of US$ 3.4 billion a year ago. Under the voluntary retention route (VRR), there were net inflows of US$ 1.4 billion during the same period. Net FDI flows moderated in April-July 2020 on the back of higher repatriation relative to fresh equity investments. Net ECBs to India recorded an outflow of US$ 8.5 billion in April-August 2020 due to slowdown in fresh disbursals and higher repayments, while net flows under NRI deposits were higher than a year ago. As on October 02, 2020, India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 545.6 billion, equivalent to 15.9 Agriculture, forestry and fishing Industry Mining and quarrying Manufacturing Electricity, gas, water supply and other utilities Services Construction Trade, hotels, transport, communication Financial, real estate and professional services Public administration, defence and other services GVA at Basic Prices months of imports, reflecting an increase of US$ 67.8 billion over the level at end-March 2020. 2019-20 (growth of 2.7 per cent), driven by productivity growth (0.8 per cent) and increased area under cultivation of vegetables (2.4 per cent) and fruits (1.6 per cent) (Table III.6). Gross value added (GVA) at basic prices which contracted in Q1:2020-21 (Table III.5) on a steep downswing in industrial and services sectors, appears to have stabilised. in Q2. The first advance estimates of production of major kharif crops for 2020-21 placed foodgrains production 0.8 per cent higher than last year\u2019s level. Coincident indicators of industry and some indicators of services also suggest that the pace of contraction is moderating in Q2. Value added in agriculture and allied activities improved on the back of higher production of foodgrains and oilseeds. The fourth advance estimates for 2019-20 released in August 2020 placed foodgrains production at 2,966.5 lakh tonnes \u2013 4.0 per cent higher than in the previous year \u2013 driven by the rabi output (Table III.6). While rice and wheat achieved record production levels for the fourth consecutive year, coarse cereals and oilseeds notched a record production level. Horticulture crops achieved production of 3,195.7 lakh tonnes in The stock of cereals at the end of October 1, 2020 was 2.2 times the buffer norms for Q3:2020-21. Minimum support prices (MSPs) announced for various crops for the both kharif and rabi season were higher in the range of 2.1 per cent to 12.7 per cent than in the previous year and assured a return of at least 50 per cent over the cost of production (as measured by A2 plus FL) across all crops. spatial distribution, while 85 per cent of the sub- divisions received normal and above normal rainfall, the cumulative rainfall in North-West India remained 16 per cent below LPA (Chart III.15b). As on October 1, 2020, the live storage in major reservoirs was 87 per cent of the full reservoir level (FRL), marginally lower than previous year's level (88 per cent) but higher than decadal average of of 76 per cent (Chart III.15c). The 2020 southwest monsoon arrived on time and made rapid progress, covering the entire country by June 26, 2020, i.e., 12 days prior to the normal date. Notwithstanding a loss of momentum in the month of July, the monsoon revived subsequently, and the cumulative southwest monsoon rainfall stood at 9 per cent above the long period average (LPA) as on September 30, 2020 (Chart III.15a). As regards the Spurred by the progress of precipitation, kharif sowing also started on higher note in the month of June. Standing at 4.6 per cent higher than the full season normal area, the overall kharif acreage has set a new record as on September 25, 2020 (Chart III.15d). Accounting for 48.9 per cent of the overall kharif acreage, rice and pulses sowing were higher by A P L m o r f n o i t a i v e D y t i c a p a c r e p s a r i o v r e s e R tractor sales improved sharply in the subsequent months (Table III.7). Farm exports recorded a turnaround from June after experiencing contraction in the three preceding months. The demand for jobs under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme (MGNREGA) has surged, with a y-o-y growth of 74.2 per cent in June, although increased employment opportunities during the kharif sowing season and reverse migration to cities is also underway. 5.6 per cent and 4.1 per cent, respectively, over the previous year\u2019s level which augurs well for foodgrains availability. The first advance estimates of production of major kharif crops for 2020-21 placed foodgrains production at 1,445.2 lakh tonnes, 0.8 per cent higher than last year\u2019s level. Production of total kharif pulses and oil seeds is estimated to be substantially higher than in the previous year (Chart III.16). Under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan Package, the government has announced measures to strengthen infrastructure logistics, capacity building, governance and administrative reforms for agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries and food processing. These measures include 8 development schemes8 with fund allocation of `1.6 lakh crore. In addition, the government has also legislated three important governance and administrative reforms to attract private investments to the agriculture sector and make it competitive, viz., amendment of the Essential Commodities Act, and promulgation of the Farming (Promotion and Produce Trade and Commerce Facilitation) bill and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services bill. These measures represent long awaited reforms in the agriculture sector, and much hinges around successful implementation. High frequency indicators relating to the farm sector also reflect a strong momentum. After a dip in April, Export - agri and allied sector Agriculture credit (Outstanding) Stocks-cereals (ratio of actual stocks to quarterly buffer norms) Massive supply side disruptions due to COVID-19 and the ensuing lockdown resulted in industrial GVA contracting by 33.8 per cent during Q1:2020-21. (Chart III.18a). The fall was widespread across manufacturing and mining and quarrying activity (Chart III.17). The index of industrial production (IIP) shrank by an unprecedented 35.5 per cent during Q1:2020-21. The extent of contraction in IIP, however, moderated in July, cushioned by electricity generation and this was also reflected in exclusion-based measures (Chart III.18b). On the other hand, the momentum gained in May, weakened in June and July due to re- imposition of lockdowns by some states (Chart III.18c). In the use-based classification, the contraction in Q1:2020-21 was dispersed across all categories (Chart III.18d). Consumer non-durables production, however, exhibited resilience and registered growth in June- July on the back of increase in the output of essential goods. Consumer durables fell substantially, with auto components, two wheelers, passenger cars, jewellery and textiles contributing the most to the decline. Capital goods, already on a declining trajectory since January 2019, plunged further during Q1:2020-21 and recorded moderation in contraction in July 2020, with commercial vehicles contributing highest to the decline. A silver lining, however, was provided by agricultural machinery, tractors, and solar power, which recorded positive growth. Electricity contracted during Q1:2020-21 due to shrinking demand, although the pace moderated considerably in May and June. Some signs of recovery became evident in July-August 2020 as demand improved with the easing of the lockdown. Hydro-electricity generation registered double-digit growth in July but contraction in August. while thermal power production remained in contraction during July-August 2020 (Chart III.19).

The contraction in manufacturing GVA in Q1:2020-21 was mirrored in sales of manufacturing companies (Chart III.20). Profit before taxes of manufacturing firms also dropped substantially (Chart III.21). Only IT companies maintained sales growth although at a decelerating pace.

As regards the overall business environment, the Reserve Bank\u2019s business assessment index moved to 96.2 in Q2 (the 91st round of the industrial outlook survey) from 55.3 \u2013 the lowest in the series starting March 2000 after large deterioration in demand conditions but it remained in contraction zone. The business expectations index (BEI) also improved to 111.4 for Q4:2020-21 from 99.5 for Q3:2020-21. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) reached 56.8 in September, the highest reading since January 2012, supported by accelerated increases in new orders and production (Chart III.22a). Almost one-third of manufacturers expect output growth in the coming 12 months, as against 8 per cent that foresee a contraction, resulting in the strongest degree of overall optimism. In Q1:2020-21, COVID-19 brought major services activities to a near halt and the sector contracted in a broad-based manner by 24.3 per cent as against a growth of 5.5 per cent a year ago. Construction recorded the steepest decline (by 50.3 per cent), followed by trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting (Chart III.23a). Indicators of construction activity \u2013 finished steel consumption and cement production \u2013 bottomed out in April 2020, the month of complete shutdown, and recovered in the following months, albeit still in contraction on a year-on-year basis (Chart III.23b). Commercial vehicle sales \u2013 a lead indicator of transportation services \u2013 contracted by 84.8 per cent in Q1:2020-21. Vehicle registrations for July and August, however, showed signs of sequential improvement. Other indicators of transport segment \u2013 rail freight traffic, cargo handled by major ports and air cargo \u2013 registered sequential recoveries. Rail freight posted growth for the second consecutive month in September (Table III.8). Air passenger traffic, both domestic and international, came to an abrupt halt during April-May owing to restrictions on travel and posted sluggish growth thereafter. The services PMI sequentially improved to 49.8 in September 2020, albeit remained in contraction zone reflecting subdued domestic and tepid external demand (Chart III.22b). The rural sector showed resilience, with robust sales of tractors \u2013 a key agricultural machinery investment \u2013 during May-August. In Q1:2020-21, decline in private education, health, entertainment and recreation activity led to fall in public administration, defence and other (PADO) services. Growth in revenue expenditure, excluding interest payments and subsidies of central government, was robust in Q1:2020-21 and upto July before it tapered off in August. Supplementary demands of `1.67 lakh crore by the central government will support GVA in PADO during Q2. GVA in financial, real estate and professional services fell in Q1:2020-21 due to weak performance of information technology companies after closing down of businesses in travel, tourism and hotel industries due to the pandemic. Real estate companies also suffered due to subdued sales growth. In financial services, bank credit growth decelerated while deposits growth marginally improved during May-September. In residential real estate, both sales and new launches contracted in Q1:2020-21, primarily due to the lockdown and sluggish consumer sentiment, leading to rise in inventory overhang (Chart III.24a). The all-India housing price index of RBI decelerated in Q1:2020-21. The sub-indices for Delhi contracted the previous quarter while substantially that for Bengaluru registered a substantial growth (Chart III.24b). Available information suggests a gradual recovery is under way with the re-opening of the economy. While the rising number of COVID-19 infections continues to weigh on the near-term outlook, private consumption may recover faster than other components of aggregate demand with a boost from rural demand on the back of bright agricultural prospects. Private investment may, however, take longer to stabilize, hamstrung by low capacity utilisation, still subdued bank credit and the global recession. The prospects for the industrial sector hinge around the response to the government\u2019s initiatives, including Make in India. The gamechanger would be public capital spending, given its high multiplier effect. An early containment of the pandemic should also speed up the revival. The outlook for the services sector also improved with activity gaining some momentum in Q2. During H1:2020-21, domestic financial markets returned to normalcy with a recovery in trading volumes, narrowing of spreads and rebounds in financial asset prices. Equity markets recovered strongly from panic sell-offs in March tracking global movements. The Indian rupee (INR) appreciated vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar with the return of investor appetite for EME assets. In the credit market, transmission has improved considerably relative to the historical experience. Going forward, liquidity conditions would continue to be calibrated, consistent with the stance of monetary policy while ensuring normalcy in the functioning of financial markets and institutions and conducive financial conditions. In Q2:2020-21, global financial markets have stabilised after recovering from the tailspin during February and March 2020. In more recent weeks, sentiments have been intermittently dampened by rising infections and geo-political tensions or lifted by news on the progress on the vaccine. In large measure, the calm in financial markets after the turbulence in March has been engendered by liquidity infusions, monetary policy actions by central banks and stimulus measures undertaken by national governments. Equity markets in major advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) have registered handsome gains with the return of risk-on sentiments. Gold prices surged to record highs in early August, but have been range-bound more recently. Bond yields softened and spreads narrowed in the wake of substantial unconventional liquidity operations and strong demand for safe assets; relative to other segments, however, bond markets have moved sideways and in a narrow range. In currency markets, the US dollar depreciated markedly as fatalities increased amid rising infection numbers and with signals from the US Federal Reserve (FED) that monetary policy would continue to remain accommodative for a long period, reinforced by an average inflation targeting framework allowing transitory target overshoot to support maximum employment. Most EME currencies have appreciated against a weakening dollar and the return of capital flows after a hiatus. During H1:2020-21, domestic financial markets returned to normalcy with a recovery in trading volumes, narrowing of spreads and rebounds in financial asset prices after a near collapse in market activity, post the imposition of the nation-wide lockdown to combat COVID-19. A slew of monetary, liquidity, credit easing and regulatory measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government\u2019s stimulus package enthused market sentiment. Nevertheless, concerns about the duration of the pandemic, the large expansion in market borrowings by the public sector, border tensions and rising inflation prints intermittently kept markets on edge. In money and bond markets, spreads compressed to below pre-COVID levels, spurring record corporate bond issuances. Equity markets recovered strongly from panic sell-offs tracking global movements. The Indian rupee (INR) initially came under pressure with the spread of the pandemic, but has subsequently appreciated vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar with the return of investor appetite for EME assets. In the credit market, transmission has improved considerably relative to the historical experience, large policy rate cuts, persisting facilitated by abundance of liquidity and the introduction of the external benchmark system for the pricing of loans in select sectors. Bank credit growth has, however, remained tepid. Money markets have remained broadly stable during H1:2020-21 due to proactive liquidity management by the Reserve Bank. In the overnight uncollateralised segment, the weighted average call rate (WACR) \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 remained within the policy corridor although it traded with a distinct downward bias, reflecting the comfortable liquidity and financing conditions (Chart IV.1). In the call money segment, the weighted average rate on traded deals persisted above rates on reported deals.1 The share of reported deals increased to 57 per cent in May 2020 from 49 per cent in the previous month due to increase in lending activity by co- operative banks whose share increased to 68 per cent in May (Chart IV.2). The increasing share of reported deals also contributed to pulling down the WACR closer to the reverse repo rate in May 2020. The share of reported deals moderated in September (41 per cent) in tandem with reduced lending (58 per cent) by co-operative banks. The secured segments (triparty repo and market repo) remained dominant in overnight money market activity in H1:2020-21, with a share of more than 95 per cent in total volumes (Chart IV.3). Within the secured segment, market repos gained in turnover, reflecting 1 \u2018Traded deals\u2019 are made directly on the negotiated dealing system (NDS)-Call platform whereas \u2018reported deals\u2019 are over-the-counter (OTC) transactions and reported on the NDS-Call platform after the deals are negotiated. (i) increase in participant base and (ii) increased lending by mutual funds. The shares of borrowings by public sector banks in both the triparty repo and market repo segments moderated in H1, while private sector banks increased their share of borrowings in the triparty repo segment. Interest rates in the secured overnight segments traded below the reverse repo rate in H1 reflecting the surplus system liquidity conditions and increased lending by mutual funds. As a result, the spread between the collateralised rates and the uncollateralised rate (WACR) widened (Chart IV.4): the triparty repo rate and the market repo rate traded below the WACR by 59 basis points (bps) and 58 bps, respectively, in H1:2020-21 as against 36 bps and 37 bps, respectively, in H2:2019-20. Interest rates on money market instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial papers (CPs) and Treasury Bills (T-bills) of 3-month maturity softened by 156 bps, 155 bps and 97 bps, respectively, in H1:2020-21, reflecting the policy rate cuts and liquidity augmenting measures. Fresh issuance of CDs by banks moderated to `45,165 crore during H1:2020- 21 (up to September 11, 2020) from around `1.75 lakh crore in the corresponding period of H1:2019-20 in view of surplus liquidity and muted credit demand. Aggregate CP issuances declined to `7.9 lakh crore during H1:2020-21 from `11.9 lakh crore during H1:2019-20 (Chart IV.5a), although corporates took advantage of lower interest rates and increased their share. The share of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in CP issuances, which was low at the 9 1 - r p A 9 1 - g u A 0 2 - r p A 0 2 - g u A beginning of H1, increased sharply in September 2020 in response to the measures taken by the Government to provide liquidity support to the non-bank lenders through the special liquidity scheme and partial credit guarantee scheme. The share of government owned NBFCs, however, declined in September 2020 as they preferred longer-term borrowings (Chart IV.5b). Fall in crude prices, US treasury yields and repo rate cut During H1:2020-21, yields on government bonds moderated, with the 10-year paper softening by 29 bps in response to the slew of conventional and unconventional measures taken by the Reserve Bank to enhance systemic liquidity and compress term spreads. These measures headed off persistent upward pressures on yields from the higher supply of paper. The hardening of yields at the beginning of Q1:2020-21 was mitigated by liquidity augmenting measures announced in the second half of April and May (Section IV.3 provides details).2 With the announcement of an enhancement of Central Government market borrowings by about 54 per cent \u2013 from `7.8 lakh crore to `12.0 lakh crore \u2013 for 2020-21, however, the benchmark yield rose by 20 bps on May 11, 2020. In June, several factors viz., low demand for dated securities; border tensions; rating downgrade by Fitch Ratings; and supply fatigue from increased issuances of T-bills and state development loans (SDL) kept yields firm. Subsequently, however, softening US treasury yields, fall in crude oil futures, and the announcement of special open market operations (OMOs) or \u201cOperation Twist\u201d, eased pressure on yields by end-June (Chart IV.6). Overall, the 10-year benchmark yield softened by 15 bps in Q1:2020-21. In Q2:2020-21, yields exhibited a hardening bias on a rise in fuel prices and higher inflation prints for June and July. The Reserve Bank conducted five operation twist auctions during July-September and backed them up with an increase in the limit of SLR securities kept under the held to maturity (HTM) category by 2.5 per cent of NDTL \u2013 from 19.5 per cent to 22 per cent. Overall, the 10-year yield (5.79 per cent GS 2030) hardened by 12 bps in Q2, mainly reflecting a 24 bps rise in August. Owing to the near cessation of market activity after the imposition of the nation-wide lockdown, the growth of average trading volume in G-sec segment was 32.3 per cent lower during H1:2020-21 than a year ago (Chart IV.7a). In contrast, the growth of average trading volume in T-bills (including cash management bills) was 62.3 per cent higher, reflecting the market preference for securities of shorter tenor to minimise duration risk amidst the uncertainty caused by the pandemic (Chart IV.7b). 2 In the first week of May, yields also eased tracking the lower cut-off in auction for a new 10-year security. Weighted average yield of traded maturities (RHS) Volume Weighted average yield of traded maturities (RHS) The yield curve responded to policy measures as well as to evolving global/domestic developments during H1:2020-21, as reflected in shifts in latent factors viz., level and slope (Chart IV.8a).3 The average level softened by 15 bps in H1 while the slope of the yield curve steepened considerably (76 bps), the latter reflecting the softening of rates at the shorter-end due to monetary easing and persistent pressures at the longer end from apprehensions of higher supply of papers in that segment (Chart IV.8b). investors (FPIs) turned net sellers in both the equity and the debt segments in April 2020.

The average inter-state spread on coupled with weak global cues, turned FPIs into net securities of 10-year maturity (fresh issuance) was In order to enable states/UTs to counter the pandemic- of liquidity augmenting measures on March 27, 2020, yields on T-bills softened sharply, dipping below advances (WMA) limit for State Governments was increased by 60 per cent in two stages (April 1 and can be in overdraft was also increased, effective April the reverse repo rate (Chart IV.10). In the face of term and liquid securities increased significantly. In order to facilitate debt consolidation, the Reserve the GoI increased the issuance limit of T-bills from `25,000 crore per week to `45,000 crore per week for the quarter ending June. This was subsequently reduced to `35,000 crore per week in Q2:2020-21. Bank conducted five switch operations on behalf of the government amounting to `76,047 crore during H1:2020-21. Reflecting these operations, the weighted s t n i o p s i s a B H1:2020-21 with decadal low yields, record primary market issuances and increased secondary market turnover. During H1:2020-21, yields on AAA-rated 3-year bonds issued by NBFCs; corporates; and public sector undertakings (PSUs), financial institutions (FIs) and banks moderated significantly \u2013 by 157 bps, 170 bps and 114 bps, respectively \u2013 aided by surplus liquidity conditions, targeted long-term repo operations (TLTROs) and \u201coperation twist\u201d auctions (Chart IV.12a). The fall in yields (of similar maturity) was also evident across issuer categories and credit ratings (Chart IV.12b). Total accepted amount increased to 10.97 years as at end-September from 10.54 years at end-March 2020. As at end -September, was lower than 7.69 per cent at end-March 2020. The corporate bond market, which experienced severe Resource mobilisation through issuances of corporate bonds in the primary market at `3.2 lakh crore during H1:2020-21 (up to August 2020) was higher by 23.5 per cent than `2.6 lakh crore during the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart IV.13a). Almost the entire resource mobilisation in the corporate bond market (99.7 per cent) was through the private placement route. Outstanding investments by FPIs in corporate bonds declined to `1.5 lakh crore at end- September 2020 from `1.7 lakh crore at end-March 2020. Consequently, FPIs\u2019 utilisation of the approved limit for investment in corporate bonds declined to 33.8 per cent at end-September 2020 from 54.5 per of COVID-19, regained normalcy during the rest of 9 1 - r p A 0 2 - g u A 0 2 - r p A 0 2 - g u A 9 1 - r p A 9 1 - g u A 0 2 - r p A 0 2 - g u A cent at end-March 2020. The daily average secondary market trading volume in the corporate bond market increased by 8.9 per cent to `8,985 crore during H1:2020-21 over the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart IV.13b), boosted by the regulatory requirement of investing a part of TLTRO funds in the secondary market. thereafter (Chart IV.14a). The spread on 3-month CPs (over 91-day T Bills) reduced from 170 bps on March 26, 2020 to 105 bps by September 30, 2020 while that on AAA-rated 3-year bonds (over 3-year G-sec) issued by corporates fell from 276 bps to 43 bps during the same period (Chart IV.14b). Following the outbreak of the pandemic, global spillover effects resulted in a significant tightening of domestic financial conditions, which peaked between end-March and mid-April but moderated gradually Over the same period, the spreads on lower rated corporate bonds also moderated significantly: by 223 bps for AA-rated 3-year bonds and by 140 bps on BBB- (BBB minus) rated 3-year bonds \u2013 the lowest rated investment grade bonds (Table IV.1).

Summing up, the measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank and the Government have restored stability in financial markets and institutions. Fears of illiquidity, which froze market activity across various segments, have been dispelled as reflected in softening of yields and narrowing of spreads across money and bond market instruments (Box IV.1). Various measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank to augment system-level and targeted liquidity produced differential responses in terms of varying intensity of appetite for funds as reflected in the bid-cover ratio (Chart IV.1.1). The announcement effects of LTROs and TLTROs on the benchmark 10-year G-sec yield is examined over a 3-hour period (windows of 15 minutes interval) prior to and after the announcement. Based on the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) tests, six out of the eight announcements had a statistically significant downward impact on yields prior to and post announcement of auctions (Table IV.1.1).4 Probability that post-announcement yield is lower than pre-announcement 4 Although there were ten auctions of LTROs and TLTROs in all, there were eight announcements for these auctions, as two auctions (February 17 and 24) were announced on February 7 and another two auctions (March 2 and 9) on February 25, 2020. For the six announcements for which the decline in yields was statistically significant, the duration and magnitude of the announcement effect on intra-day yields can be examined by the average difference in yields at intervals of 15 minutes post-announcement from that of the average yield an hour prior to the auction announcement. The maximum average impact is found fifteen minutes after the announcement with a moderation of about 4 bps in yields from the average of the hour before announcement (Chart IV.1.2). An hour after the announcement, the moderation in yields turns statistically insignificant. In order to explore the impact of the actual auction outcome on yields and their persistence in an event study framework (Hartley and Rebucci, 2020), an autoregressive (AR) model is estimated, based on data spanning December 2019-August 2020, for daily changes in 10-year bond yields (G-sec as well as corporate bonds separately) regressed on LTRO and TLTRO auction dates (as dummies) with controls for other key variables that can impact yields, The estimates indicate that the LTRO and TLTRO auctions softened yields on 10-year G-secs and on 10-year corporate bonds by around 29 bps and 47 bps, respectively (Table IV.1.2)6. The reduction in the policy rate (from 5.15 per cent to 4.0 per cent over the sample period) is estimated to have softened G-sec and corporate bond yields by another 8-9 bps. Overall, the measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank had a sobering impact on yields and risk spreads, which helped in easing market stress and softening financing conditions. \u03a3Lag (-1 to -2) \u0394Policy rate \u0394US policy uncertainty (-1) \u03a3LTRO \u03a3TLTRO \u03a3LTRO + \u03a3TLTRO Note: Deeper, moderate and lighter shades indicate that median difference is significantly different from zero at 5 per cent level, 20 per cent and 30 per cent level of significance, respectively, using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

After undergoing intense volatility in Q4:2019-20 following the COVID-19 outbreak with a massive disruption in business activity, the Indian equity market made a strong V-shaped recovery in H1:2020- 21. The BSE Sensex gained 46.5 per cent in H1:2020-21 after hitting a low of 25981 on March 23, 2020 (Chart IV.15a). Strong rallies in global equity markets on the back of massive fiscal and monetary stimuli in major countries and the measures undertaken in India boosted domestic market sentiments. dismal quarterly earnings results of corporates; and (iii) extension of lockdown till end-May. The announcement of the `20 lakh crore \u201cAtmanirbhar Bharat\u201d stimulus package by the Government and a large policy repo rate cut by the Reserve Bank on May 22 boosted investor sentiment. The market rebounded in June 2020 with the BSE Sensex posting its best quarterly return (18.5 per cent) since 2009. Border tensions and downward revision in India\u2019s GDP growth projections for 2020-21 by various agencies capped the upside in equities. In Q1:2020-21, the equity market had posted its biggest monthly gain in 11 years in April 2020, with the BSE Sensex increasing by 14.4 per cent. In the later part of April, the closure of six debt fund schemes by a mutual fund weighed adversely on domestic market sentiment. This was quickly reversed, however, following the Reserve Bank\u2019s announcement of liquidity augmenting measures, including the special liquidity facility for mutual funds (SLF-MF) on April 27, 2020. Bearish sentiments gripped the stock market in early May, with the Sensex declining by 2002 points (5.9 per cent) on May 4 in sync with global peers amidst (i) escalating tensions between US and China; (ii) The recovery continued in July and August on the back of positive news from encouraging trials of the coronavirus vaccine and hopes of more supportive measures by national authorities globally. On the domestic front, the rally in equities was also supported by improvement in the manufacturing PMI for June 2020, reports of disengagement between India and China over border issues and better than expected Q1:2020-21 corporate earnings results. Domestic market sentiment was tempered during August by contraction in manufacturing PMI and higher-than-expected CPI inflation print for July 2020. The stock market plummeted sharply in the last trading session of the month due to fresh escalation 9 1 - r p A 9 1 - g u A 0 2 - r p A 0 2 - g u A in Indo-China border tensions and witnessed cautious trading ahead of the implementation of new trading norms on margin requirements by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) from September 1, 2020. Investor sentiment remained insipid in September 2020 amidst concerns over steady increase in coronavirus infections and weak global cues. After registering moderate gains due to improvement in domestic manufacturing PMI for August 2020, equity sentiments turned negative with the BSE Sensex witnessing its biggest intra-day fall in more than four months on September 24 as spike in infections in some European countries triggered fears of a second round of lockdown. Bullish sentiments, however, returned towards the end of the month amid expectations of further stimulus measures by the government. (Chart IV.15b). Resource mobilisation through public and rights issues of equity increased to `76,830 crore during H1:2020-21 from `60,133 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The INR exhibited movements in both directions against the US dollar during H1:2020-21. After depreciating to its lowest level of `76.81 on April 22, 2020, the INR subsequently appreciated owing to FPI flows to the domestic equity market with the return of risk appetite for EME assets and the depreciation of the US dollar. The appreciation of the INR against the US dollar was modest as compared with EME peers (Chart IV.16a). During H1:2020-21, FPIs turned net buyers in the Indian equity market after panic sales in March due to flight to safety. MFs, however, were net sellers to the tune of `24,801 crore during H1:2020-21 In terms of the 36-currency nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), the INR depreciated by 0.6 per cent (as at end-September 2020 over the average of March 2020), but it appreciated by 2.1 per cent in terms of the 36-currency real effective exchange rate (REER) Note: Appreciation (+)/Depreciation (-). Sources: RBI; FBIL; IMF; Bloomberg; Thomson Reuters; and Bank for International Settlements (BIS). during the same period (Table IV.2). Between March and August 2020, the appreciation of the INR in terms of the REER was lower than that of the Indonesian rupiah, the Taiwan dollar and the Philippine peso (Chart IV.16b). A cross-market barometer illustrates vividly the recovery in financial markets from the disruptions caused by the pandemic.7 The barometer consists of nine indicators across markets (money, bonds, foreign exchange and equities) and compares the level of each indicator on a certain day with its pre-turmoil level (calibrated as zero on the scale) and with its level at a \u2018peak\u2019 in the turmoil (calibrated as 100).8 The pre- turmoil level for all indicators is taken as January 1, 2020, while the peak turmoil day is indicator specific and happens to concentrate around March 24, 2020 (the day of imposition of country-wide lockdown) and in some cases in May 2020 (Chart IV.17). The barometer presents four different stages after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic (by construction, a decreasing tendency indicates recovery of the market segment). In response to the gradual opening of the economy and the proactive measures taken by the Reserve Bank and the Government, an improvement in sentiments in the foreign exchange and stock market indicators took hold from May onwards. Money and bond market spreads started easing following (i) the introduction of the new benchmark paper on May 8, 2020; (ii) the announcement of Atmanirbhar Bharat stimulus package by the Government; and (iii) policy rate cut of 40 bps on May 22, 2020.

Non-food credit growth (y-o-y) at 5.1 per cent as on September 25, 2020 was lower than 8.6 per cent a year ago, driven by weak momentum and base effects (Chart IV.18). s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P The slowdown in credit growth was spread across all bank groups, especially foreign banks. Credit growth of the public sector banks remained modest, although with some uptick since March 2020 (Chart IV.19a). Of the incremental credit extended by the scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) on a year-on-year basis (September 27, 2019 to September 25, 2020), 62.3 per cent was provided by the public sector banks and 41.2 per cent by the private sector banks, while the share of the foreign banks turned negative (Chart IV.19b). 9 1 - r p A 0 2 - r p A 0 2 - g u A 9 1 - g u A Note: Monthly numbers are based on average of the fortnights. Source: RBI The deceleration in non-food credit growth was broad- based with credit offtake slowing down in all the major sectors. Though personal loans and credit to agriculture registered some improvement in July 2020, Public sector banks(including regional rural banks) Private banks (including small\ufb01nance banks) Foreign banks the momentum could not be sustained in August. Credit growth to services and industrial sectors has also tapered off after showing some promise in Q1; 2020-21 (Chart IV.20a). Personal loans accounted for the largest share of total credit flow in August 2020, followed by services. While the share of personal loans, services and agriculture increased in August 2020 vis-a-vis the previous year, the share of industry contracted (Chart IV.20b). accelerated in August 2020 as compared with a year chemical products, rubber plastic and their products, beverage and tobacco decelerated/contracted.

Credit to the NBFC sector decelerated to 17.1 per cent in August 2020 from 38.8 per cent a year ago. In the personal loan segment, growth in vehicle loans accelerated from 3.7 per cent in August 2019 to 8.4 per cent in August 2020; during the same period, growth in housing loans decelerated from 16.6 per cent to 11.1 per cent. The share of trade in non-food credit flow increased sharply in August 2020 vis-a-vis its level in the corresponding month of the previous year (Chart IV.21b). The asset quality of SCBs improved during 2020-21 (up to June), with the overall non-performing assets (NPA) ratio declining to 8.0 per cent in June 2020 from 9.4 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.22a). The NPA ratio in respect of agriculture and services increased over the same period (Chart IV.22b). Boosted by TLTROs, non-SLR investments of banks (comprising investments in CPs, bonds, debentures and shares of public and private corporates) increased by 1.8 per cent in H1:2020-21 as against a decline of 3.9 per cent in H1:2019-20 (Chart IV.23a). Adjusted non-food credit growth decelerated from 8.4 per cent in Q2:2019-20 to 5.1 per cent in Q2:2020-21 (Chart IV.23b). Banks augmented their SLR portfolios in the wake of deceleration in credit offtake and higher government borrowings. Consequently, excess SLR maintained by all scheduled commercial banks increased to 11.1 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in Q2:2020-21 (up to August 28) from 7.1 per cent a year ago (Chart IV.24). The transmission of policy repo rate changes to deposit and lending rates of banks improved since the April 2020 MPR. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declined by 91 bps since March 2020 in response to the reduction of 115 bps in the policy repo rate and comfortable liquidity conditions (Table IV.3). Note: Excess SLR is based on the average of all reporting Fridays in the quarter. Data for Q2:2020-21 is up to August 28, 2020. Source: RBI. The pass-through to WALR on fresh rupee loans was higher than the softening of yield on 5-year corporate bonds (79 bps) and yield on 10-year G-Secs during March \u2013 August 2020 (Chart IV.25). The WALR on outstanding rupee loans declined by 46 bps during this period, but this transmission is an improvement over the earlier period. 2019 and 3.25-3.50 per cent immediately prior to the introduction of the external benchmark, were placed at 2.70-3.00 per cent in September 2020. The flexible adjustment of saving deposit rates bodes well for monetary transmission to lending rates in comparison to the rigidity characterising saving deposit rates in earlier years. Of the 105 bps reduction in the weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on outstanding rupee deposits during the ongoing easing cycle (i.e., since February 2019), a little over half of the decline, i.e. 59 bps occurred since March 2020. The median term deposit rate, which reflects the prevailing card rates, has registered a sizable decline of 125 bps since March 2020, reflecting the combined impact of surplus liquidity, the introduction of external benchmark-based pricing of loans and weak credit demand conditions (Chart IV.26). The decline in both the lending and deposit rates is more pronounced for foreign banks (Chart IV.27). The deposit base of foreign banks is primarily made up of low cost and lower duration wholesale deposits, which adjust quickly to policy rate changes. On the other hand, the public sector banks depend more on retail term deposits and face competition from alternative saving instruments like small savings, which constrains them from lowering rates in sync with the policy rate. While the private sector banks exhibited greater transmission in terms of WALR on fresh rupee loans and WADTDR compared to public sector banks, the decline in WALR on outstanding rupee loans is more for public sector banks. Apart from the reduction in term deposit rates, many banks also lowered their saving deposit rates during the current easing cycle. The saving deposit rates of five major banks, which ranged 3.50-4.00 per cent at the beginning of the easing cycle in early February The 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) charged by public sector banks and private sector banks declined further during H1:2020-21 (Chart IV.28). s t n i o p s i s a B Scheduled commercial banks Spreads of WALRs on outstanding rupee loans and fresh rupee loans over 1-year median MCLR were uneven across sectors (Chart IV.29). In personal loans, the spread was among the lowest in respect of housing loans, reflecting lower defaults and the availability of collateral. Personal loans - other than housing and vehicle loans - are mostly unsecured and involve higher credit risk; hence, the spread charged was the highest for other personal loans. The lower WALRs on rupee export credit reflect the interest rate subvention provided by the government. in There has been a significant transmission to all new loans sanctioned since October 2019 when the new floating rate loans to retail and MSME sectors were mandatorily linked to the external benchmark (Chart IV.30). The quantum of decline in WALRs on personal and MSME loans was more than that for aggregate fresh rupee loans to all sectors (120 bps). The introduction of external benchmark linked loans has incentivised banks to adjust their term as well as saving deposit rates in line with the benchmark rates to protect their net interest margins (NIMs). The reduction in term deposit rates applies only to fresh term deposits, while it is across the board in the case of saving deposits.9 The latter brings about an instantaneous reduction in the banks\u2019 cost of 9 Saving deposits accounted for 32.2 per cent of aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks (excluding regional rural banks, payment banks and small finance banks) as on September 25, 2020. (Percentage points) on fresh rupee loans (provided the spread over the MCLR remains relatively stable). Thus, the impact of introduction of external benchmark-based pricing of loans on monetary transmission has encompassed even sectors that are not linked to external benchmark loan pricing. After lowering these rates sharply during Q1:2020- 21, small saving interest rates were left unchanged for Q2:2020-21 and Q3:2020-21 notwithstanding the decline in G-sec yields during the reference period, resulting in a wedge of 40-120 bps in Q2 and 83-203 bps in Q3 in respect of various small savings instruments relative to the formula-based rates, with implications for monetary transmission (Table IV.5). In respect of fresh rupee loans linked to the policy repo rate, the median spread charged by domestic banks was the highest in the case of other personal loans, followed by that for the MSME sector, whereas housing loans have the lowest spread. Among the bank groups, the median spread charged by public sector banks for different categories of loans was lower than those of private sector banks (Table IV.4). Administered interest rates on small savings are linked to market yields on G-secs with a lag and are fixed on a quarterly basis at a spread of 0-100 bps over and above G-sec yields of comparable maturities. The RBI Act 1934 requires the RBI to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time, if any, in the public domain. During H1:2020- 21, liquidity management operations by the RBI were conducted as per the revised liquidity management framework introduced on February 14, 2020 and guided by the need to expand liquidity in the system sizeably to ensure that financial markets and institutions function normally in the face of COVID- related dislocations, consistent with the monetary policy stance (see Chapter III of Annual Report 2019- 20 for details).10 Formula based Rate of Interest (%) (applicable for Q3:2020-21) $: Spreads for fixing small saving rates as per Government of India Press Release of February 2016.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse impact on real economic activity, the Reserve Bank reduced the policy repo rate by 40 bps on May 22, 2020 on top of a 75 bps reduction on March 27. In order to make it relatively unattractive for banks to passively park funds with the Reserve Bank and to encourage their deployment for on-lending to productive sectors of the economy, the policy interest rate corridor was widened to 90 bps through a reduction of 25 bps in the reverse repo rate on April 17, 2020. Liquidity augmenting measures initiated since February 2020 were further reinforced during H1:2020-21, including those targeted at specific sectors and entities to alleviate liquidity and funding stress (Box IV.2). (i) Auctions of long term repo operations (LTRO) during February-March 2020 for one-year and three- year tenors to facilitate monetary transmission and augment credit flows to productive sectors. MSMEs from the maintenance of cash reserve ratio (CRR), with a view to revitalise the flow of bank credit to productive sectors having multiplier effects on growth. (ii) Scheduled allowed exemption on incremental credit disbursed by them between January 31-July 31, 2020 on retail loans for automobiles, residential housing and loans to commercial banks were (iii) Two 6-month US dollar/INR sell/buy swap auctions were conducted on March 16 and March 23, 2020 cumulatively providing dollar liquidity amounting to US$ 2.7 billion. (iv) Fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions were conducted during March 2020 to provide flexibility to the banking system in its liquidity management towards the year end. As a special case, standalone primary dealers (SPDs) were allowed to participate in these auctions along with other eligible participants. (v) To facilitate year-end liquidity management of SPDs, liquidity available to them under the Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF) was temporarily enhanced from `2,800 crore to `10,000 crore on March 24, 2020. The facility was available till April 17, 2020. least 50 per cent of the total amount availed going to small and mid-sized non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and micro finance institutions (MFIs). (xi) Special refinance facilities for a total amount of `75,000 crore at the policy repo rate to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), the National Housing Bank (NHB) and the Export-Import Bank of India (EXIM Bank) to meet sectoral credit needs. (vi) The CRR requirement of banks was reduced by 100 bps \u2013 from 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) to 3.0 per cent of NDTL on March 27, 2020 \u2013 effective fortnight beginning March 28, 2020, for a period of one year ending March 26, 2021, augmenting primary liquidity in the banking system by about `1.37 lakh crore. (vii) Taking cognisance of hardships faced by banks in terms of social distancing of staff and consequent strains on reporting requirements, the requirement of minimum maintenance of daily CRR balance was reduced from 90 per cent to 80 per cent effective from the fortnight beginning March 28, 2020. This dispensation was available up to September 25, 2020. (viii) Banks\u2019 limit for borrowing overnight under the marginal standing facility (MSF) by dipping into their statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) was raised to 3 per cent of NDTL from 2 per cent \u2013 effective up to March 31, 2021 \u2013 allowing them to avail additional liquidity under the LAF window at the reduced MSF rate. (ix) Targeted long-term repo operations (TLTROs) of up to three years tenor at a floating rate linked to the policy repo rate for deployment in investment grade corporate bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures over and above the outstanding level of investments in these bonds as on March 27, 2020. (x) Targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO) 2.0 auctions in tranches of appropriate sizes, with at (xii) Special liquidity facility for mutual funds (SLF-MF) to alleviate intensified liquidity pressures from redemption burdens faced by MFs. the Atmanirbhar Bharat package announced by GoI in May, a scheme was introduced through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to improve the liquidity position of NBFCs including MFIs and housing finance companies (HFCs) registered with the Reserve Bank for avoiding any potential systemic risks to the financial sector. (xiv) Term repo operations at floating rates (i.e., at the prevailing repo rate) in September to assuage liquidity pressures on account of advance tax outflows. Banks that had availed of funds under LTROs (at 5.15 per cent) were allowed to reverse these transactions before maturity and avail fresh funds at 4 per cent (current repo rate). (xv) From September 1, 2020, banks were allowed to hold fresh acquisitions of SLR securities under held to maturity (HTM) category up to an overall limit of 22 per cent (increased from 19.5 per cent) of NDTL up to March 31, 2021. (xvi) Purchases of government securities under OMOs of `1.91 lakh crore since February 6 and up to September 30, 2020. (xvii) In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the yield curve and improve transmission, six \u2018operation twist\u2019 auctions were conducted in H1:2020-21 (on April 27, July 2, August 27, September 3, 10 and 17) for `10,000 crore each.11 11 While operation twist is intended to be liquidity neutral, the outcome of the 6 auctions resulted in net liquidity absorption of `2,768 crore (sales of `59,900 crore vis-a-vis purchases of `57,132 crore). Overall, total liquidity support announced by the Reserve Bank since February 6 (up to September 30, 2020) amounted to `11.1 lakh crore (5.5 per cent of GDP) (Table IV.6). LTRO Variable rate repo SLF for PDs CRR cut MSF (dip by 1% in SLR) TLTRO TLTRO (2.0) Net OMO purchases Special liquidity facility for mutual funds Refinance to NABARD,SIDBI,NHB and EXIM bank Special liquidity scheme for NBFCs 56-day term repo During H1:2020-21, the key drivers of systemic liquidity were currency in circulation (CiC), net forex operations by the Reserve Bank and Government of India (GoI) cash balances. The large expansion in CiC was the major source of leakage, particularly during Q1. Liquidity was augmented by a large drawdown of excess CRR balances by commercial banks consequent to the one percentage point reduction of CRR. While the steady build-up of GoI cash balances in Q2 moderated the level of surplus, the Reserve Bank\u2019s forex purchase operations augmented systemic liquidity throughout H1 (Chart IV.31a). In terms of liquidity management, durable liquidity was injected through TLTROs and OMO purchases (mainly in Q1), while transient liquidity movements were managed through LAF operations (Chart IV.31b). CiC growth (y-o-y) of `2.36 lakh crore (9.6 per cent) the during H1:2020-21 expansion of `49,378 crore (2.3 per cent) in H1:2019-20 (Chart IV.32). The large scale of CiC expansion significantly outpaced Note: (+) implies injection of liquidity while (-) implies absorption/leakage of liquidity; Data are based on the last Friday of the quarter. Source: RBI. s n o i t a i r a V Total repo (including LTRO and TLTRO) Net injection (+)/ absorption (-) indicates heightened precautionary demand for cash in a pandemic-stricken environment. Fuelled by the infusion of `87,891 crore through four TLTRO auctions in April, systemic liquidity remained in abundance with average daily net absorptions under the LAF progressively increasing from `3.02 lakh crore in March to `4.75 lakh crore in April and further to `5.31 lakh crore in May 2020, notwithstanding large liquidity withdrawal from the banking system due to CiC expansion (Chart IV.33). Sustained government spending through higher recourse to WMA/OD (average of `1.01 lakh crore and `1.14 lakh crore in April and May, respectively) also added to the liquidity surplus. With the onset of the monsoon season, government spending decelerated and GoI cash balances turned into surplus in June (average of `34,838 crore); consequently, average daily net absorptions under the LAF moderated to `4.08 lakh crore. Overall, net average absorption of surplus liquidity at `4.71 lakh crore in Q1:2020-21 was the highest since January-March 2017 \u2013 the quarter immediately following demonetisation. Surplus liquidity conditions persisted in Q2, although with some moderation relative to Q1. Large liquidity injection through the Reserve Bank\u2019s net forex purchase operations in July was offset by moderate CiC expansion and gradual build-up of GoI cash balances as government spending remained subdued. Daily net absorptions under the LAF averaged `3.95 lakh crore in July as average GoI cash surplus increased to `95,938 crore. Thereafter, daily net absorptions increased to `4.03 lakh crore in August but moderated to `3.68 lakh crore in September due to higher GoI cash surplus (average of `1.68 lakh crore in August and `2.80 lakh crore in September). The RBI also injected liquidity through OMO purchases, particularly during Q1:2020-21. Total injection of durable liquidity (including forex purchases, OMOs and TLTRO) in H1:2020-21 amounted to `5.38 lakh crore as compared to `5.86 lakh crore in H2:2019-20 (Chart IV.34). Summing up, systemic liquidity surplus increased during H1:2020-21 reflecting the conventional and unconventional measures by the Reserve Bank to Note: Data are based on the last Friday of the quarter.

The extent of the surplus is gauged from the large amounts absorbed under the reverse repo facility, which peaked at more than `8.5 lakh crore on May 5, 2020 (Chart IV.35). Domestic financial markets have gradually regained normalcy in the wake of sizable conventional and unconventional measures by the Reserve Bank. Turnover in various market segments is increasing and spreads have narrowed appreciably. The return of capital inflows is an indicator of growing investor confidence in the Indian economy. The pace of monetary transmission has also quickened, but credit growth remains feeble, clouding the outlook. Going forward, liquidity conditions would continue to be calibrated, consistent with the stance of monetary policy while ensuring normalcy in the functioning of financial markets and institutions and conducive financial conditions. Efficient monetary policy transmission, particularly to the credit market, would continue to assume priority in the hierarchy of policy objectives. The global economy is still reeling under the impact of the unprecedented shock caused by COVID-19. Even as high frequency indicators suggest that the economic activity may have begun to bottom out in Q3, the near-term outlook remains hostage to the virus and the attendant uncertainty regarding its vaccine. Inflation has remained largely subdued and below central banks\u2019 target for advanced economies (AEs) as also for some emerging market economies (EMEs). Monetary policy remained highly accommodative with key policy rates reduced to their lowest level in most countries. Global financial markets remained buoyant, supported by signals that the highly accommodative monetary policy would continue for long. The pandemic has plunged the global economy into its deepest contraction in history in Q2:2020. World merchandise trade volume contracted by 14.3 per cent (q-o-q) in Q2. Just as various economies were engaging in unlocking activity, and a general sense emerging of the global economy stabilising and getting poised for a recovery in Q3, fresh waves of infections have surged, threatening these positive impulses. Meanwhile, commodity prices have firmed up, pushing up inflation. Although headline and core inflation remain subdued and below target in several economies, food price pressures are firming up. Global spillovers have accentuated, mainly through financial channels. Although financial markets have recovered from the panic sell-offs in Q1:2020 and capital flows to EMEs have resumed on the return of risk sentiment, asset prices are volatile, out of alignment with underlying fundamentals, and the outlook is uncertain. Monetary policy guidance from systemic central banks has led to weakening of the US dollar with corresponding appreciation in other currencies, especially EME currencies, with implications for export performance and growth. In addition, disruptions in global value chains (GVCs) have amplified supply shocks inflicted by the pandemic. Some near-term indicators have improved. Global purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) indicates that on a month-on-month basis, the output and new orders as also business sentiments have revived since July and new export orders returned to growth in September. The recovery, however, is nascent and hinges on the duration of the pandemic and discovery of the vaccine. Underlying the stabilisation of financial markets, the easing of financial conditions and the hesitant recovery is the unprecedented policy response of monetary and fiscal authorities. These actions have led to a renewal of risk appetite and search for yields, slowing the precautionary flight to cash. Notwithstanding this defence, the outlook is highly uncertain, policy space is largely used up and the virulence of the pandemic is yet to abate for recovery to gain traction. In the US, GDP growth contracted by a record 31.4 per cent [q-o-q, seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR)] in Q2:2020, marking the worst plunge since the present GDP series began in 1947. Coming on the heels of a 5.0 per cent contraction in Q1:2020, the US economy was pushed into a technical recession (Table V.1). Most US states imposed complete shutdowns in April and for most part of May with only gradual and uneven reopening and relaxation in preventive measures towards the end of the quarter. While the unemployment rate has declined markedly from an all-time high in April, it remains much above the pre-COVID level. Industrial output continued to contract through August, though the momentum appears to be picking up as reflected in robust growth in retail sales since end of Q2. The manufacturing PMI moved back into expansion zone from June. The recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases has increased Quarter-over-quarter (q-o-q) seasonally adjusted, annualised rate \u2013 following a contraction of 14.1 per cent in Q1. Industrial production and retail sales collapsed, while employment situation and consumer sentiments worsened in April-May as most member countries adopted extensive and prolonged lockdown measures to fight the health crisis. With retail sales improving in June and the composite PMI moving back into the expansion zone in July, the Euro economy exhibited signs of recovery in the early part of Q3. However, the momentum has slowed down as increase in fresh wave of infections prompted some countries in the region to reinstate restrictions. The Japanese economy contracted by 28.1 per cent (q-o-q, SAAR) per cent in Q2, marking the third straight quarter of contraction and the steepest on record, as private consumption and industrial production slumped, while public spending and business fixed investment declined sharply following the nation-wide state of emergency. Furthermore, plummeting exports on disrupted supply chains and weak external demand led to further deterioration in economic conditions. While gradual reopening, both domestically and abroad, has eased demand and supply conditions and helped stabilise manufacturing activity, available high frequency indicators remained in contraction zone through August.

Economic activity in the Euro area plunged at a record pace in Q2 as frozen business and household activity caused by stringent lockdowns and social distancing measures inflicted an unprecedented blow to all constituent economies. GDP of the Euro area contracted by 39.4 per cent (q-o-q, SAAR) in Q2 \u2013 the sharpest since the series began in 1995 The UK economy fell into a technical recession in Q2 as prolonged confinement measures weighed heavily on economic activity. While the economy rebounded in June as gradual withdrawal of restrictions released pent-up demand, it was not strong enough to offset the magnitude of economic slack that the country experienced during the period of complete shutdown. The recovery continued into Q3 as both manufacturing and services PMI strengthened since July on robust output and new orders, reflecting improved consumer and business spending. The unemployment rate, however, remains high and investment intentions have remained weak. In September, some lockdown measures were re-imposed as a second wave of infections hit the UK. The Chinese economy bounced back in Q2 with GDP growing at 3.2 per cent (on y-o-y basis) as against a record contraction of 6.8 per cent in Q1. The turnaround was spearheaded by rising investment in infrastructure, supported by government spending, and increase in exports of medical products and electronics. The uptrend continued into Q3 as exports improved further since July amidst a modest improvement in external demand, and industrial production remained stable despite heavy floods experienced in some parts of the country. Manufacturing activity as measured by the manufacturing PMI recorded expansion in each month since May, supported by rising output and new orders. On the other hand, retail sales remain weak on depressed private consumption under social distancing measures. While the Chinese economy is expected to maintain the pace of its recovery, the prolonged global downturn, re-escalating tensions with the US and persistent risk of a second wave of COVID-19 infections remain major headwinds, going forward. plunged markedly in Q2. Brazil, India and Russia are nations suggest that macroeconomic performance in 2020 could worsen further (Table V.2). The Russian economy shrank in Q2, birched by the pandemic induced lockdowns and sharp fall in oil prices. All sectors, barring agriculture, were severely impacted amidst stringent measures adopted to stem the pandemic. Industrial production and retail sales contracted through August on muted business rate has risen. The Brazilian economy entered into a technical recession in Q2, following sharp declines sector activity. The growth outlook remains clouded as external demand is expected to remain weak, while domestic spending and industrial activity are likely to stay subdued with social distancing measures in P: Projection *: Data on forex reserves for 2020 pertains to the forex reserves holding as of August 2020 for all countries except for China whose data was avaialble till July 2020. #: Gross debt refers to the non-financial public sector, excluding Eletrobras and Petrobras, and includes sovereign debt held by the central bank.

The pandemic has also exposed the integrated global economy to significant supply chain disruptions reconfiguring the global value chains (Box V.1). After the 1990s, international trade proliferated on the back of the rise of global value chains (GVCs) which contributed to increase in productivity and came to be viewed as a fast track to industrialisation for the emerging market economies (Baldwin, 2011; Ignatenko et al., 2019). After the global financial crisis, however, GVCs slowed down with the confluence of protectionist trade policies. More recently, COVID-19 has accentuated the contraction in global trade volumes with major supply disruptions \u2013 around 80 countries have imposed export restrictions and prohibitions on medical supplies and pharmaceuticals (WTO, 2020). A survey of 23 industry value chains conducted by Mckinsey Global Institute (2020) revealed that the semiconductor industry, followed by communication equipment, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, automobile, machinery and chemical industry would be the most affected by trade-related disruptions (Chart V.1.1a). The apparel industry followed by aerospace, furniture and petroleum products, transport, automobile and textile would be exposed to higher risks during the pandemic (Chart V.1.1b). The survey estimates that potential restructuring in global value chains could shift 16 to 26 per cent (US$ 2.9 trillion to US$ 4.6 trillion) of global goods exports to new countries in the next five years. It identifies three sectors, viz., pharmaceuticals, petroleum and apparel where the shift in supply chain networks might happen (McKinsey Global Institute, 2020). The extent to which a country is integrated into these supply chains can be measured by the GVC participation index, which is a sum of backward and forward linkages. With the pandemic expected to diversify the supply chains from the current manufacturing hub, beneficiaries could be countries such as Vietnam, Mexico and India. The determinants of GVC participation such as economic fundamentals, factor endowments, geography, market size and institutional environment can be examined in an empirical framework (Fernandes et al., 2020) specified as follows: Vit = a0 + ai X it + Tt + eit l a c i t u e c a m r a h P s e c i v e d l a c i d e M e g a r e v e b d n a d o o F e r u t l u c i r g A s t n e n o p m o c d n a c i s a B t n e m p i u q e l a c i r t c e l E s c i n o r t c e l e d n a s t c u d o r P l a t e m d e t a c i r b a F t n e m p i u q e n o i t a c i n u m m o C m a r e c d n a , s s a l G t n e m p i u q e d n a y r e n h c a M c i t s a l p d n a e l i t x e T e v i t o m o t u A t n e m p i u q E n o i t a t r o p s n a r T e r u t i n r u F e c a p s o r e A l e r a p p A Note: Chart considers exposure to shocks, but no action taken to build resilience or mitigate impact.

X represents a vector of trade policy related explanatory variables viz., net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows; weighted average tariff rates; resource endowments, viz., ratio of capital to GDP, ratio of land to GDP and rents from resources; domestic industrial capacity measured in terms of manufacturing sector\u2019s value-added; logistic performance index; political stability and distance from GVC hub e.g., the US, Germany and China. Variable Tt controls for time fixed effects. The model is estimated on 144 countries for the period 1990- 2018 using UNCTAD (Eora database). The decomposition of backward participation reveals that better logistic performance, higher capital endowment, stable political environment and higher FDI are central to strengthening backward linkages in the supply chain. These results assume significance in the context of several initiatives to strengthen logistic infrastructure through national trade facilitation plan which aims to transform the trade ecosystem by reducing the time and cost of doing business. Consequently, relaxation in local procurement norms for single-brand retail trade has generated interest among global tech and retail giants such as Apple and Ikea. Manufacturing units in India may provide a unique opportunity to expand the country\u2019s foothold in GVCs. Lower tariff rates and better connectivity with the GVC hub can also contribute to stronger backward linkages. However, the estimates also show that countries with a larger domestic industrial capacity exhibit lower backward participation as they may rely less on imported inputs and use more domestic inputs for exports (Chart V.1.2a). Countries with better performance in logistics, lower distance from the GVC hub and greater land and natural resource endowment exhibit significantly stronger forward participation than peers (Chart V.1.2b). As in the case of backward linkages, a country\u2019s capital affects forward participation positively, though the effect is not statistically significant. Countries seeking to expand foothold in GVCs need to lower trade barriers, demonstrate higher reliance on regional or free trade agreements, provide cutting edge logistics infrastructure, increase industrial capacity and strengthen political stability. Note: (1) The analysis is based on a five-year average of the variables. GVC participation and factors exhibit more variation in a five-year span compared to year-on-year (2) The dependent variable is average backward or forward participation in logarithmic terms. The variable \u201cdistance\u201d is the distance from the GVC hub, i.e., the average distance of the country from China, the US and Germany.

(3) The slope coefficients of the determinants are shown as bars in the chart. Regression coefficients with *, ** and *** reflects significance at 1, per cent, 5 per Global commodity prices fell sharply in March-April, with oil prices plunging to record lows as lockdowns across countries depressed demand. From May, however, prices recovered as demand prospects improved following the gradual withdrawal of lockdown restrictions. The Bloomberg commodity price index increased by 14.5 per cent between April and September. The food price index of the Food and Agriculture increased by 1.0 per cent Organization (FAO) between April and August. Global food prices eased since February before witnessing some uptick in June on the back of rising vegetable oil, dairy products and sugar prices. Excess stockpiles amidst weakening external demand, diminishing restaurant sales and reduced demand from food manufacturers resulting from COVID-19 restrictions, pulled down prices for most food products between February and May. However, since June, food prices have edged up as global import demand improved, while export supplies tightened due to weather shocks and production slowdown across major producing countries (Chart V.3a). Crude oil prices plunged in March-April, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices falling below zero to US$ (-)37.63 per barrel on April 20, 2020, as the unprecedented shock due to COVID-19 amidst the escalating Saudi-Russia price war over production cuts, flooded the oil market with excess supply. Crude oil prices have increased since then, recouping April losses, as optimism on demand following gradual withdrawal of lockdown in some countries and continued production cut by major energy producers buoyed sentiments. Major oil producers, both inside and outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) planned to partially restore production from August following the cuts agreed to in the OPEC plus agreement of April, and this kept oil price range bound in July. Oil price firmed up for the larger part of August on news of falling inventories and recovery in fuel demand. However, the rally lost steam in September as fears of a second wave of COVID-19 infections, lack of visibility of the expected demand recovery and ramping up of production by some smaller OPEC members changed expectations again (Chart V.3b). Base metal prices, measured by the Bloomberg\u2019s base metal spot index, increased by 27.5 per cent between April and September 2020 as against a decline of 19.3 per cent in Q1 and regained all the losses incurred after the outbreak of COVID-19. Most industrial metal prices have exhibited bullish movements since April- May, underpinned by China\u2019s restocking due to its early recovery and the massive stimulus packages by global central banks. Gold prices remained elevated, increasing by almost 24.3 per cent on a year-to-date (YTD) basis (till September 30, 2020) as heightened uncertainties and highly accommodative policies of central banks continue to boost the safe haven appeal of the yellow metal, pushing prices above the US$ 2000 mark in early August. However, the bullion witnessed sell-offs in mid-August on Russia\u2019s announcement of potential vaccine and profit booking by investors and have remained broadly range bound for larger part of September before falling by 3.3 per cent in last week on strong US dollar and flight to cash (Chart V.4). CPI inflation remained largely benign in major AEs, but exhibited modest upticks in some EMEs since June. Barring India, inflation remained at sub-target levels in most of the AEs and EMEs, reflecting subdued demand amid lockdowns (Table V.3). Notes: (1) The ECB aims at inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The Federal Reserve in August 2020 adopted a new policy strategy of \u2018average inflation targeting\u2019 under which it would allow the inflation rate to go above the target of 2 per cent rate for brief periods to make up for the shortfall from the targets in earlier periods. Central Bank of Canada aims to keep inflation at the 2 per cent mid-point of an inflation control target range of 1-3 per cent. In the US, inflation measured by the personal consumer expenditures (PCE) price index eased during February-June on the back of subdued aggregate demand and lower consumer energy prices. Although it has edged up since June, the pick up has been modest and drawing strength from the recovery in spending for consumer goods and services due to resumption of activities. Notwithstanding the increase, the PCE price index based inflation remained well below the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target. In the Euro area too, actual inflation remained much below the target as prices have edged down since March and inflation rate slipped below zero since August on falling prices of energy products and non-energy industrial goods. In Japan, CPI inflation remained subdued, despite a slight uptick in July, on weak core consumer prices and inflation expectations. In the UK, rising prices of recreation and culture activities led to an increase in CPI inflation in June-July; however, inflation edged down in August on easing meal prices led by the \u2018Eat Out to Help Out\u2019 scheme by the Government, falling air fares and clothing prices (Chart V.5a). (2) Brazil\u2019s, Indonesia\u2019s and Thailand\u2019s inflation target for 2019 were 4.25 \u00b1 1.5 per cent, 3.5 \u00b1 1 per cent and 2.5 \u00b1 1.5 per cent, respectively. (3) Quarterly inflation numbers are monthly averages. (4) India\u2019s inflation is based on calendar year basis. Data for Q2:2020 refer to June only as NSO did not provide inflation rates for April and May. CPI inflation across major EMEs eased during March- May on weak demand and depressed global crude oil prices, but has recorded modest increases since June. Nonetheless, it remained below pre-COVID-19 levels and even below central bank targets for some economies. In China, consumer price inflation edged up in June-July on higher food prices resulting from an increase in pork prices and supply disruptions caused by floods. However, it fell in August as supply disruptions eased, restoring demand-supply balance. In Brazil, CPI inflation has recorded modest gains since June on the back of rising prices for transportation, increasing housing prices and cost of health and personal care, but remains below the central bank\u2019s target. CPI inflation in South Africa started picking up in June and moved back into the central bank\u2019s target range of 3-6 per cent since July, primarily driven by high prices of food and beverages. CPI inflation in Russia, unlike its peers, has been increasing since March, with only a modest drop in May. Increasing food, non-food and services prices amidst supply disruptions and the gradual release in pent-up demand as also weak ruble, supported the uptrend. However, inflation remains below the central bank\u2019s target of 4 per cent through September (Chart V.5b). With the onset of the pandemic, fiscal authorities around the world have unveiled stimulus packages to overcome the downturn. Estimates as of mid-June 2020 by the IMF show more aggressive support by the AEs (Table V.4). Central banks have also provided unprecedented monetary accommodation. The key policy rates are at their lowest level in most countries. One important difference is that while the AE central banks used up the limited policy space available to them in March, the EMEs continued to cut rates through Q2 and Q3 of 2020. In August 2020, following a comprehensive and a public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools and communication practices, the Federal Reserve announced its new monetary policy strategy under which it seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 per cent over time. As per this \u2018flexible average inflation targeting\u2019 paradigm, the Fed would allow the inflation rate to be moderately above the 2 per cent rate for brief periods to make up for the shortfall from the target in earlier periods. Furthermore, according primacy to maximum employment, the Fed would henceforth respond to \u2018shortfalls\u2019 of the employment from its maximum level rather than its \u2018deviations\u2019. As regards the actual conduct of monetary policy, the US Fed has maintained a pause on the target range of the policy rate in all Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings since the emergency rate cut in mid- March. In April 2020, the Fed announced the Main Street Lending Programme, a package of support for households and businesses, worth US$ 2.3 trillion. Since June, the Fed has indicated that it would continue asset purchases at the current pace over the coming months to sustain smooth market functioning. In its September meeting, the first after the adoption of the new monetary policy framework, the Fed stated that it would keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0-0.25 per cent till labour conditions become consistent with the FOMC\u2019s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 per cent and moderately exceeds it for some time. In Q3, the Fed increased the duration and made favourable changes to the scope as also pricing of several facilities announced in March/ April in response to COVID-19. Some facilities1 that were to expire in September have been extended up to December 2020, while the temporary US dollar liquidity swap lines and the temporary repurchase agreement facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA repo facility) have been extended up to March 2021. The European Central Bank (ECB) has not changed key rates in response to the pandemic so far. In its April 2020 meeting, the ECB eased conditions for accessing targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) and introduced a new series of non- targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) to support liquidity conditions in the euro area financial system. In its June meeting, the ECB expanded the envelope for the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by 600 billion (about US$ 680 billion)2 to a total of 1,350 billion (about US$ 1,531 billion), while also extending time horizon for net purchases under the the programme to June 2021. There were no new announcements in the two meetings in Q3. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has also not changed key rates in response to the pandemic. In April, the BoJ announced significant enhancement of monetary easing including removing the limit of 80 trillion yen (about US$ 746 billion) on additional annual holdings of government bonds. The limits on additional purchases of commercial papers and corporate bonds were enhanced. The BoJ also strengthened the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to facilitate financing in response to COVID-19. In May, it introduced a new 2 The US$ approximations for all the amounts mentioned in another currency in this Chapter are based on the exchange rate prevailing on the date/month of announcement of the particular measure. measure under these operations for fund provisioning against loans. The maximum amount of financing under the Special Funds Supplying Operations is about 100 trillion yen (about US$ 933 billion). The Bank of England (BoE) has maintained a pause on the Bank Rate, which is at its all-time low of 0.1 per cent since March 2020. In its June meeting, however, the BoE increased the target stock of purchase of UK government bonds by an additional \u00a3100 billion (about US$ 124 billion), taking the stock of total asset purchases to \u00a3745 billion (about US$ 926 billion) for 2020. There were no new announcements in its meetings held in Q3. purchase facility. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) maintained the targets for the cash rate and the yield on 3-year Australian Government bonds at 25 basis points each in its monthly meetings held during Q2 and Q3 of 2020. In September, the RBA announced an increase in the size of its term funding facility and extended it up to June 2021. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) maintained its policy rate at its historic low of 0.25 per cent in each of its meetings since April. The RBNZ, however, increased the limit on its large scale asset purchase programme from NZ$ 30 billion (about US$ 17 billion) to NZ$ 33 billion (about US$ 20 billion) in April, to NZ$ 60 billion (about US$ 36 billion) in May and further to NZ$ 100 billion (about US$ 66 billion) in August. The Bank of Canada (BoC) has maintained a pause on the policy rate at 0.25 per cent since March. In April, the BoC announced new measures for provincial bond and corporate bond purchases, a temporary increase in weekly purchases of Treasury bills and enhancement of funding under term repo facility to two years. In June, with improvement in short-term funding conditions, the BoC reduced the frequency of term repo operations and its bankers\u2019 acceptance The central banks of South Korea and Norway were the only two AE central banks to effect a rate cut beyond Q1:2020. Both reduced their policy rate by 25 bps each in May to 0.5 per cent and 0 per cent, respectively (Chart V.6a). The Swedish Riksbank maintained its policy rate at 0 per cent, but in its June meeting it increased the amount of asset purchases from SEK 300 billion (about US$ 30 billion) to SEK Note: The policy rate changes are mapped to the time when the decision was announced and not when it took effect. Source: Bloomberg. 500 billion (about US$ 54 billion) and extended the time period of the purchases up to June 2021, while also announcing purchase of corporate bonds from September onwards. EMEs, on the other hand, continued to cut rates well into Q3. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) effected a 20 bps cut in the one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) to 3.85 per cent in April and has maintained a pause since. Prior to the policy decision in April, the PBoC had reduced the interest rate on excess reserves to a record low of 0.35 per cent, while also reducing the reserve requirement ratio for smaller banks by one per cent. In May, the PBoC lowered the reserve requirement rate for all large financial institutions by another 150 basis points to 11 per cent. Other BRICS central banks remained in accommodative mode. The central bank of Brazil reduced the Selic rate by 75 bps each in May and June, following it up with a 25 bps cut in August as inflation remained below the target. The central bank of Brazil took a pause in its September meeting, the first after nine consecutive rate cuts since August 2019. The Bank of Russia cut its policy rate by 50 bps, 100 bps and 25 bps in April, June and July, respectively before pausing in September. The South African Reserve Bank cut its policy rate by 100 bps, 50 bps and 25 bps in April, May and July, respectively, as overall risks to inflation outlook remained balanced and took a pause in September (Chart V.6b). The central bank of Turkey cut its policy rate by 100 bps in April and 50 bps in May and maintained a pause thereafter. In August, the central bank increased the Turkish Lira and forex reserve requirement ratios for banks fulfilling real credit growth conditions. In September, however, the central bank increased its policy rate by 200 bps to restore the disinflation process and support price stability. The central bank of Mexico cut its policy rate by 50 bps in each month of Q2:2020 and effected 50 bps cut in August and another 25 bps cut in September. Bank Indonesia cut its policy rate by 25 bps each in June and July and has maintained a pause since August. Amongst other major EME central banks, the Bank of Thailand and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas cut their rates in Q2 while Bank Negara Malaysia and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka reduced rates in both Q2 and Q3. Global financial markets went into a tailspin in March that continued up to March 23, 2020 when the US Federal Reserve announced extensive measures to support the economy, including removing the upper bound on its asset purchases. The announcements engendered a recovery in financial markets across the world. Aided by equally extensive and in some cases, co-ordinated monetary policy action by central banks, financing conditions have improved. Among AEs, the US equity market has continued to recover from the slide in March, with intermittent corrections. In July, equity indices moved higher on prospects of successful development of a vaccine and better than expected corporate performance. Towards the end of July, there was some correction due to resurgence of infections and increasing tensions with China, but the exceptional performance of the prime technology companies helped in overriding the pessimism. In August, the S&P 500 index closed at all-time highs on seven occasions. It peaked further in early September followed by correction, with shares of technology companies registering a large decrease. In the other major AEs, even as stock indices have been rising gradually, they are yet to recover year- to-date losses. In the Euro area, despite news on the finalisation of the Next Generation EU fund3, the stock 3 In July, the European Council has agreed on the Next Generation EU (NGEU) fund, under which 750 billion will be borrowed on the capital markets and spent only to address the challenges/consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spending will commence in 2021, of which 390 billion will be in the form of grants. The debt issuance will end by 2026 and repayment will be scheduled until 2058. market remained flat with differential pace of opening of multiple economies and localised resurgence of infections. The uptrend in the stock market in the UK was even more gradual, with the country registering the worst economic contraction among major AEs. The stalemate over Brexit negotiations has dampened sentiment on the outlook. Japanese stocks also slowly recovered from the slide in the earlier part of the year in Q2, and thereafter the index has almost stalled. In the second half of September, stock markets in the Euro area and UK corrected further with rising possibility of a second wave of infections and need for lockdown. unprecedented policy accommodation and continuing safe haven demand. There has been some hardening of yields in Q3 in the AEs, particularly in August, mainly on account of mixed news on the economic front (Chart V.8a). With renewed virus concerns, safe haven demand for US Treasuries has resurged. Yields in EMEs, on the other hand, have witnessed considerable softening since Q2:2020 after the rout in the earlier part of the year. This has been on the back of large monetary loosening, including bond purchase programmes undertaken by a few EME central banks. China has, on the contrary, seen a rise in yields after the pause following the 20 bps cut in policy rate in April. Stock markets in EMEs have seen rapid recovery, starting from Q2 (Chart V.7). Risk-on sentiments following massive monetary accommodation by central banks led to resumption of capital flows to EMEs, which have strengthened further in Q3. In September, however, stock markets in EMEs have also corrected on global cues. The flight to cash phase in bond yields ended on March 23, 2020. Thereafter, yields softened in AEs and remained range-bound in Q2, in part due to the In currency markets, the US dollar has weakened considerably since March 23, 2020. Expectations of the policy rates staying low for a considerable time horizon, largest number of COVID-19 infections and fatalities in the world, grim employment news and tensions with China have imparted weakness to the US dollar (Chart V.8b). The euro has strengthened considerably against the dollar. With resumption of capital flows, most emerging market currencies have strengthened since Q2:2020. However, the US dollar strengthened in September on safe haven demand as waning vaccine optimism amidst rising infections in Europe and the UK and uncertainty regarding US stimulus package triggered risk-off sentiments. The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index increased by 1.6 per cent in Q2:2020 and by a further 2.7 per cent in Q3:2020. In sum, the global economy is still reeling under the impact of the unprecedented COVID-19 shock. Even as high frequency indicators suggest that the economic activity may be beginning to bottom out in Q3, the near-term outlook remains hostage to the virus and attendant uncertainty around the discovery of the vaccine. The slight uptick in inflation of some EMEs in recent months notwithstanding, risks to the recovery remain on the downside due to the sizeable aggregate demand compression effect and continued disruption of supply. As major central banks have pledged to keep rates at the current historic low levels and governments are implementing large fiscal support programmes, the improvement in financing conditions that is still unfolding should impart upside to the recovery when it takes hold. ", "file11": "excluding Food and Fuel The slowdown in domestic economic activity that started in 2018-19 extended into the first half of 2019-20. Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation is projected to remain below target over the rest of 2019-20 and the early months of 2020-21. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to recover in H2:2019-20, facilitated by favourable base effects and transmission of past monetary policy actions. A slew of measures by the government impart an upside to growth prospects. Intensification of global uncertainty around US-China trade tensions, a hard Brexit and geo-political tensions are key downside risks to the baseline growth path. Since the release of the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of April 2019, global economic activity has weakened further. Several downside risks flagged in the April MPR appear to be materialising: escalation of trade tensions; growing probability of a disorderly Brexit; volatility in crude oil prices; and a risk-on risk-off sentiment in financial markets on tumultuous geo- political and economic events. In their wake, global growth has lost the momentum it had gathered in Q1:2019. Central banks across advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) are easing monetary policy in counter-cyclical defence. Global trade has sunk into contraction, with knock- on effects impacting investment and industrial production, especially manufacturing. Reflecting this, commodity prices slumped, with crude oil prices tumbling in August and gold prices surging on safe haven demand. Foreign exchange markets turned volatile, following the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi in early August. Crude oil prices were bolstered temporarily in mid-September by the attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities and disruption to global oil supplies. Domestically, the slowdown in economic activity that started in 2018-19 extended into the first half of 2019-20. Real GDP growth fell to a 25-quarter low in Q1:2019-20 on weak private consumption and investment and high frequency indicators for Q2 point to a slowdown in the various constituents of aggregate demand deepening. Some green shoots are emerging though in agriculture and allied activities. The initial delay and deficiency in the south-west monsoon has been mitigated by the resurgence of rains during July-September. Comfortable reservoir levels augur well for rabi sowing and foodgrains stocks above the buffer norms provide a cushion against potential inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, headline CPI inflation remains below target. While food inflation has edged up since March 2019, inflation excluding food and fuel has undergone a broad-based moderation. During April-August 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met thrice in accordance with the bi-monthly schedule. In the April meeting, the MPC cut the repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 6.0 per cent (with a majority vote of 4-2) to strengthen domestic growth impulses by spurring private investment, while maintaining a neutral stance (with a majority vote of 5-1). With signs of weakening of growth impulses even further widening the negative output gap, and with headline inflation projected to remain below the target over the next 12 months, the MPC voted unanimously to reduce the repo rate by another 25 bps in its June 2019 meeting and changed the stance of monetary policy from neutral to accommodative. In its August meeting, the MPC reduced the policy repo rate by a further 35 bps to 5.40 per cent on signs of accentuation of the slowdown in domestic activity amidst deteriorating global growth and escalating trade tensions posing downside risks to the outlook. With the inflation outlook projected to be benign and within the target over the forecast horizon, all members of the MPC voted unanimously to reduce the policy rate (4 members for a reduction of 35 bps and two for 25 bps) and to maintain an accommodative stance. The MPC was of the view that the standard 25 bps cut might prove to be inadequate in view of evolving global and domestic macroeconomic developments, while a 50 bps reduction might be excessive, especially taking into account the actions already undertaken. Overall, the MPC reduced the policy repo rate by a cumulative 85 bps during April-August, in addition to the reduction of 25 bps in February. The MPC\u2019s voting pattern reflects the diversity in individual members\u2019 assessments, expectations and policy preferences, a feature that is reflected in voting patterns of the MPC in other central banks (Table I.1). Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. Chapters II and III analyse the macroeconomic developments during April-September 2019 and explain deviations of inflation and growth outcomes vis-\u00e0-vis staff\u2019s projections. Turning to the outlook, the evolution of key macroeconomic and financial variables over the past six months warrants revisions in the baseline assumptions (Table I.2). First, international crude oil prices declined between mid-May and mid-September reflecting weakness in global demand amidst excess supply conditions and large stockpiles, despite geo-political tensions and production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (Chart I.1). Crude oil prices hardened temporarily in the second half of September following disruptions to production in Saudi Arabia. Given the current demand-supply assessment, the baseline scenario assumes crude oil prices at an average of US$ 62.6 per barrel. Second, the nominal exchange rate (Indian rupee, INR vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar) has depreciated from its April level, especially during August, impacted by a drop in the Chinese renminbi below the psychological level of 7 yuan per US$ in the wake of an escalation in US-China trade actions. A generalised flight to safety towards the US dollar assets and portfolio capital outflows also amplified pressures on the rupee. The rupee came under renewed pressure in mid-September following the spike in crude oil prices but recovered in subsequent days following the announcement of various measures by the government to boost investment and growth and to stabilise the flow of funds into the capital market. and services, reflecting the slowdown in domestic demand. Looking ahead, inflation expectations feed into future inflation through price and wage contracts. One-year ahead inflation expectations of urban households increased by 20 bps over the previous round in the September round of the survey conducted by the Reserve Bank; three-month ahead inflation expectations moved up by 40 bps during this period (Chart I.3).1 According to the Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey for September, Third, the weakening of global economic activity and trade is confirmed by the global manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) remaining in contraction zone in September 2019 at 49.7, the World Trade Organisation's Goods Trade Barometer indicating weakness in merchandise trade persisting in Q3:2019 and downgrades to global growth projections by various agencies. Against this backdrop, global growth for 2019 and 2020 is now expected to be below the April baseline (Table I.2 and Chart I.2). Headline CPI inflation has remained below target so far in 2019-20. Importantly, inflation excluding food and fuel has softened across major goods 1 The Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households is conducted in 18 cities and results of the September 2019 survey are based on responses from 5,810 households. inflation expectations moderated from the previous round. Manufacturing firms polled in the July-September 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) expected an increase in the cost of raw materials and muted selling prices in Q3:2019-20 (Chart I.4).2 According to the purchasing managers\u2019 survey for manufacturing firms, input prices eased in September due to weak demand for raw materials and semi-finished items; output prices registered a marginal increase. Services sector firms reported lower input prices and higher output prices in August. projected at 3.4 per cent in Q2:2019-20, 3.5 per cent in Q3, and 3.7 per cent in Q4, with risks evenly balanced (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2019-20 are 2.7-4.7 per cent and 2.2-5.3 per cent, respectively. For 2020-21, assuming normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will move in a range of 3.5-4.0 per cent. The 50 per cent and the 70 Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in September 2019 expected CPI inflation to increase from 3.2 per cent in August 2019 to 3.9 per cent in Q4:2019-20 and to 4.0 per cent in Q2:2020-21 (Chart I.5).3 Taking into account the initial conditions, the signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from time-series and structural models, CPI inflation is 2 The results for the July-September round of the industrial outlook survey are based on responses from 481 companies. 3 29 panelists participated in the September 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of professional forecasters. per cent confidence intervals for Q4:2020-21 are 2.5- 5.4 per cent and 1.8-6.2 per cent, respectively. and spatial \u2013 could impinge upon the prospects for agriculture. There are both upside and downside risks to the baseline inflation forecasts. The upside risks include: volatility in international and domestic financial markets from trade tensions, Brexit and monetary policy stances of the major AEs; supply disruptions in the global crude oil market due to geo- political tensions; and, sudden spikes in the prices of perishable food items. Downside risks could emanate from more than assumed softening in crude oil and other commodity prices due to sluggish global demand, and weaker inflation excluding food and fuel domestically due to depressed domestic demand conditions. Turning to the outlook, consumer confidence for the year ahead moved lower in the May, July and September rounds of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, due to ebbing of sentiments on the general economic situation and the employment scenario (Chart I.7).4 Sentiment in the manufacturing sector polled in the July-September 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s IOS dipped for the quarter ahead, reflecting moderation in expected production, order inflows, capacity utilisation, employment conditions and exports (Chart I.8). As indicated earlier, domestic economic activity turned out to be weaker in H1:2019-20 vis-\u00e0-vis projections in the April 2019 MPR in an environment of global headwinds. The expected pick-up in both private consumption and investment failed to materialise, and exports lost momentum under the weight of the slump in world trade. Although the south-west monsoon turned out to be above long period average, its uneven progress \u2013 both temporal Surveys by other agencies of future business expectations indicate a mixed picture (Table I.3). Firms in the manufacturing and services sectors polled in the Nikkei\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 surveys were optimistic about one-year ahead output prospects. In the September 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, professional forecasters expected real GDP growth to recover from 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20 to 4 The survey is conducted by the Reserve Bank in 13 major cities and the September 2019 round is based on responses from 5,192 respondents. 7.2 per cent in Q4:2019-20 and then moderate to 7.0 per cent in Q2:2020-21 (Chart I.9). Taking into account the baseline assumptions, survey indicators, the reductions in the policy repo rate since February 2019, the base effects and model forecasts, real GDP growth is projected at 6.1 per cent in 2019-20 \u2013 5.3 per cent in Q2, 6.6 per cent in Q3, 7.2 per cent in Q4 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced (Table I.4).

However, further escalation of trade tensions, a hard or no-deal Brexit and increased volatility in global financial markets pose downside risks to the baseline growth path. The baseline projections of inflation and growth in the preceding sections are conditional on the assumptions relating to the key variables set out in Table these assumptions could lead to upward and downward deviations from baseline projections. This section assesses the balance of risks to the baseline projections in plausible alternative scenarios. I.2. Uncertainties surrounding There are upside as well as downside risks to the baseline growth scenario (Chart I.10). The measures announced by the government in August-September to boost growth and investment \u2013 policy reforms on foreign direct investment (FDI), upfront release of funds for recapitalisation of public sector banks (PSBs), merger of PSBs, incentives for exports and real estate, reduction in the corporate income tax rate \u2013 along with a faster resolution of stressed assets, and a faster pace of transmission of past repo rate cuts by The baseline scenario assumes a slowdown in external demand in 2019 and 2020. Yield curve inversion in major AEs has raised concerns about the growth outlook (Box I.1). Global growth could turn out to be weaker if there is further escalation of trade tensions, a hard/no-deal Brexit, a greater- than-envisaged slowdown in some major economies like China, or a combination of these factors. In such a scenario, if global growth slips down by 50 bps vis-\u00e0-vis the baseline, domestic growth and inflation could be lower by around 20 bps and 10 bps, respectively, from their baseline trajectories (Charts I.11a and I.12a). Conversely, an expeditious and orderly resolution of trade tensions, and/or a The spread between yields on the US 10-year and 3-month treasury securities \u2013 a closely watched metric for term spread \u2013 has inverted for the first time since 2007 and turned negative at 13 basis points (bps) in June 2019. The spread has remained in negative territory for the third consecutive month in August at 35 bps (from 83 bps a year ago). Since the 1950s, US recessions have been preceded by sizeable inversions in the yield curve. The only occasion when the 3-month Treasury security yield exceeded the 10-year Treasury yield without the occurrence of a subsequent recession was in September 1966. Barring this, yield curve inversion has coincided with a recession in the following 18-24 months (Chart I.1.1a). Inversion/narrowing of yield spreads has occurred in other AEs. Yields have flattened in Germany, the UK, Japan, Singapore and Australia, mirroring a slowdown in the global economy. In the case of Germany, the spread of the 10-year bond yield over the 3-month bond yield turned negative falling to 24 bps in August 2019 as compared with 61 bps a year ago. Germany experienced recessions beginning in 1966, 1973, 1980, 1991, 2001 and 2008. All recessions, except the 1966 recession, were preceded by a sharp decline in long-term Treasury security yields relative to short-term yields. The only inversion that was not followed by a recession was in 1970 (Chart I.1.1b). According to the expectations hypothesis of the term structure, long-term interest rates equal the sum of current and expected future short-term interest rates plus a term premium. The term premium explains why the yield curve usually slopes upwards, i.e., yields on long-term securities usually exceed those on short-term securities. The yield curve flattens or inverts/slopes downward when the public expects short-term interest rates to fall. In such a scenario, investors bid up the prices of longer-term securities causing a fall in long-term yields relative to yield on short-term securities. There is no unanimity, however, on the theoretical relationship between the term spread and economic activity. To a large extent, the usefulness of the spread for forecasting economic activity remains a \u201cstylised fact in search of a theory\u201d (Benati and Goodhart, 2008). Moreover, the predictive power of the term spread for output growth depends on monetary policy objectives and the reaction function used. In the case of monetary policy tightening for example, short-term rates are likely to rise more than long-term rates and cause the yield curve to flatten or possibly invert (Feroli, 2004). It is also argued that the term spread forecasts output growth better, the more responsive the monetary authority is to deviations of output from potential. The spread forecasts less accurately if monetary policy focusses exclusively on controlling Notes: 1. Yield spread between 10-year and 3-month Treasury securities has been measured as the quarterly average of monthly observations. inflation. The consumption smoothing model derives a relationship between the slope of the yield curve and future economic activity by assuming that individuals prefer stable consumption rather than high consumption during periods of rising income and low consumption when income is falling (Harvey, 1988). If they expect a recession in the future, consumers sell short-term financial instruments and purchase bonds at a discount to generate income, resulting in a flattening or inversion of the yield curve. The empirical literature suggests that the yield spread predicts output growth at a four-to-six-quarter horizon with considerable variation across countries and over time. However, the ability of the term spread to forecast output growth has declined since the mid-1980s (Wheelock and Wohar, 2009). On the other hand, probit models show that the yield spread outperforms in relation to other macroeconomic and financial variables while predicting the probability of recession (Estrella and Hardouvelis, 1991; Estrella and Mishkin, 1998). steeper is the yield curve \u2013 higher the yield on 10- year Treasury securities relative to that on 3-month Treasury securities \u2013 the higher is the future rate of GDP growth. Similarly, correlations between GDP growth and future yield spreads up to six quarters have been found to be negative and statistically significant for both countries, except for period t+1 where it is insignificant for both countries. Negative correlations between GDP growth and the lead terms of the yield spread suggest that higher the GDP growth in period t, less steep would be the yield curve in subsequent quarters (Sahoo and Gupta, 2019). To sum up, the yield spread has been useful in predicting output growth and recessions at least up to one year in advance, particularly in major AEs, although its signalling value has somewhat blurred in the present environment of unconventional monetary policies. The current phase of negative yield spreads warrants that policymakers remain vigilant. The contemporaneous correlation between the yield spread and real GDP growth was found to be statistically insignificant for both the US and correlations Germany between GDP growth and the yield spread lagged by one to six quarters were found to be positive and statistically significant for both the countries, except for the period t-1 for Germany, where it was found to be insignificant. These correlations suggest that the Sahoo, S. and B. Gupta (2019), \"Does Yield Spread Predict Output Growth?\", Reserve Bank of India (Mimeo). Wheelock, D. C. and M. E. Wohar (2009), \u201cCan the Term Spread Predict Output Growth and Recessions? A Survey of the Literature\u201d, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, September/October. smooth Brexit could boost confidence and provide support to global trade and demand. Should global growth surprise by 50 bps on the upside, domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by around 20 bps and 10 bps, respectively. The Indian basket of crude oil prices has exhibited high volatility in the first half of 2019-20 and the outlook remains uncertain. Upside risks to the baseline assumption can emanate from geo-political tensions. Assuming crude oil prices increase to US$ 73 per barrel, inflation could be higher by around 30 bps and growth weaker by around 20 bps from the baseline. Conversely, crude oil prices could soften further if global demand turns out to be weaker than expected. Should the price of the Indian basket of crude fall to US$ 53, inflation could ease by around 30 bps and growth could be higher by around 20 bps (Charts I.11a and I.12a). The INR depreciated vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar in August 2019, reflecting global developments. Looking ahead, rising trade protectionism, and slowing global trade and global output could increase volatility in international financial markets and exert further downward pressure on the currency. Should the INR depreciate by 5 per cent from the baseline, inflation could edge up by around 20 bps and boost net exports and GDP growth by around 15 bps. In contrast, a slew of measures taken by the government to boost output and investment, policy reforms in the FDI regime, and greater than expected monetary policy accommodation by the central banks in major AEs could attract increased capital inflows and lead to an appreciation of the INR. An appreciation of the INR by 5 per cent could moderate inflation by around 20 bps and GDP growth by around 15 bps vis-\u00e0-vis the baseline (Charts I.11b and I.12b). Food prices picked up during April-August, mainly due to pressures from prices of vegetables and pulses. However, overall food inflation remains benign. The baseline path assumes that food inflation will firm up in the near term reflecting, inter alia, the seasonal pick-up in prices of vegetables and some pick-up in prices of pulses as the demand-supply balance stabilises. There are both upside and downside risks to the baseline. The strong revival of monsoon during July-September and the resultant catch-up in kharif sowing, large buffer stocks, and improved prospects for rabi crops from better reservoir levels could soften food inflation more than assumed, and consequently, headline inflation could be below the baseline by up to 50 bps. However, heavy rains and floods in some areas could exert some upward pressure on food inflation and accordingly, headline inflation could be higher by around 50 bps (Charts I.11b and I.12b). Headline inflation is projected to remain below the medium-term target of 4 per cent over the rest of 2019-20 and the early months of 2020-21. Volatility in international and domestic financial markets, as well as global crude oil prices, and domestic prices of perishable food items pose upside risks to the baseline inflation path. On the other hand, the softer outlook on global commodity prices and large buffer stocks could keep headline inflation below the baseline. Real GDP growth is expected to recover in H2:2019- 20, facilitated by favourable base effects and transmission of past monetary policy actions. The measures announced by the government in August-September to boost growth \u2013 such as release of funds for recapitalisation of public sector banks, merger of public sector banks, reforms in the FDI regime, initiatives for exports and the real estate sector, reduction in the corporate income tax rate \u2013 and faster resolution of stressed assets could push growth above the baseline path. Intensification of global uncertainty around US-China trade tensions, a hard Brexit and geo-political tensions are key downside risks to the baseline growth path. Consumer price inflation registered an uptick during March-August 2019, underpinned by a pick-up in food inflation, particularly in vegetables and protein-based items. Fuel group inflation moderated sequentially after April and moved into deflation in July and August 2019. Inflation excluding food and fuel has softened since March in a broad-based manner notwithstanding a sharp increase in gold prices. Nominal growth in rural wages, both for agricultural and non-agricultural labourers, remained subdued. Growth in organised sector staff costs showed divergent movements \u2013 rising for the manufacturing sector and remaining range bound for the services sector. Farm inputs and industrial raw materials price inflation has softened in 2019-20 so far. Over the last six months i.e., March-August 2019 consumer price index (CPI) inflation trailed below the target of 4.0 per cent averaging 3.1 per cent over this period.1 Its key driver was food prices which emerged out of deflation in March 2019 and gradually firmed over the ensuing months in the usual summer season upturn. In contrast, prices of fuel and light items remained soft and slumped into deflation during July-August 2019. Excluding food and fuel, inflation ebbed by around 100 basis points between March- June 2019 and reached a 23-month low in June 2019, before registering some uptick during July-August (Chart II.1). The RBI Act, 1934 (amended in 2016) enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual outcomes from projections, if any, and to explain the underlying reasons thereof. The Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of April 2019 had projected CPI inflation at 2.9 per cent for Q1:2019-20 and 3.0 per cent for Q2:2019-20. Actual inflation outcomes have, by and large, tracked these projections (Chart II.2). While food prices moved out of deflation as anticipated, the summer rise in prices of vegetables this year was more pronounced than observed in recent history. Pulses prices moved out of two and a half years of deflation in May 2019. As a result, food inflation inched up by 230 basis points, larger than expected, between March and August 2019. Meanwhile, inflation excluding food and fuel softened more than anticipated, providing an offset. The Indian basket of crude oil prices eased unexpectedly \u2013 from an average of US$ 67 per barrel during 2019-20 (which was the baseline assumption in the April MPR) to below US$ 60 per barrel in August. Prices within the fuel group 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year changes in all India CPI Combined (Rural and Urban). underwent substantial correction in respect of both rural items of consumption such as firewood and dung cake and those of urban usage such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Consequently, the fuel group as a whole slipped into deflation during July-August. On the whole, these divergent movements caused CPI headline inflation outcomes to marginally overshoot inflation projections, i.e., by 20 basis points each in Q1:2019-20 and Q2:2019-20 (July-August) (Chart II.2). A decomposition of year-on-year (y-o-y) inflation shows that its rising trajectory during March to June 2019 was propelled by a sustained increase in price momentum (Chart II.3). In July, large favourable base effect helped moderate the high price momentum.2 In August, however, the price momentum outweighed a low base effect and consequently, inflation edged 2 Inflation (i.e., the y-o-y change in CPI) in any given month arithmetically equals the previous month\u2019s inflation plus the difference between current month-on-month (m-o-m) change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). See Box 1.1 of MPR, September 2014. up marginally. The elevation in price momentum in H1:2019-20 was driven by the food group, mainly by prices of vegetables, pulses, meat and fish. In contrast, the momentum underlying fuel and light inflation collapsed during July-August under the weight of a broad-based decline in prices of items of rural and urban fuel consumption. The momentum of prices of items excluding food and fuel moderated during March-August 2019 and was completely overwhelmed by favourable base effects, barring July. adjusted basis moderated during June-August 2019 across both goods and services categories (Chart II.5).3 A historical decomposition of inflation shows that it was impacted by positive supply shocks in H1:2019- 20, which, in conjunction with subdued domestic demand, kept headline inflation low and stable (Chart II.6a).4 The distribution of inflation across CPI groups shows a considerable drop in median inflation rates \u2013 from 4.8 per cent in 2018 to 2.1 per cent in 2019 so far. Moreover, the negative skew in inflation in 2017 and 2018 resulting from food prices was absent that a generalised moderation in inflation was underway this year (Chart II.4). Diffusion indices of month-on-month (m-o-m) price changes in CPI items on a seasonally implying The break-up of overall CPI inflation into goods and services components suggests that perishable goods (non-durable goods with 7-day recall) such as vegetables and fruits were the largest contributor to overall inflation during April-August (Chart II.6b). The contribution of less perishable goods (non-durable goods with 30-day recall) moderated due to deflation in prices of rice, petroleum products, LPG and electricity. The contribution of durable goods to overall inflation increased during June-August 2019, primarily on 3 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. A reading above 50 for the diffusion index signals generalisation of price increases and a reading below 50 signals a broad-based deflation. 4 Historical decompositions are used to estimate the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period, based on a Vector Auto Regression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 the annual growth rate in crude oil prices; inflation; the output gap; the annual growth rate in rural wages and the policy repo rate. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et ; where et represents a vector of shocks [oil price shock; supply shock (inflation shock); output gap shock; wage shock; and policy shock]. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. account of a sharp increase in prices of gold and to a lesser extent, in those of motor vehicles. Imported goods (petrol; diesel; LPG; kerosene; electronic goods; gold; silver; chemical and chemical products; metal and metal products; and refined vegetables oils) together contributed negatively to overall inflation in the recent period (Chart II.6c). The contribution of services to overall inflation moderated. However, services (with a weight of 23.4 per cent in overall CPI) contributed to about a third to overall inflation (Chart II.6b). In terms of weighted contribution, the food and beverages group (weight: 45.9 per cent in CPI) contributed 32.9 per cent to overall inflation during April-August 2019 as compared with 25.0 per cent for the same period a year ago. Inflation in the food group turned positive beginning March 2019 \u2013 after remaining in the negative zone for five consecutive months during October 2018-February 2019 \u2013 and increased steadily thereafter driven by prices of vegetables, fruits and protein-rich items such as pulses, meat, fish and milk (Chart II.7a). Within the food and beverages group, the price build-up during the financial year so far in the case of vegetables has been substantial, but close to historical summer price increases. In the case of fruits, pulses, meat and fish, the price build-up has been, in fact, larger than the historical average (2011-18). For all the other sub-groups within the food group, the build-up has been much lower than in the past (Chart II.7b). Inflation in respect of cereals (weight of 9.7 per cent in CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group) remained moderate during April-August 2019, with rice prices remaining in deflation, reflecting robust production and adequate stocks. As per the fourth advance estimates of foodgrain production, production of rice was at 1164 lakh tonnes in 2018- 19, higher than 1128 lakh tonnes in 2017-18, which was until recently an all-time record. Exports of rice declined during April-July 2019 as the 5 per cent incentive provided by the government to rice exporters under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) was withdrawn from April 1, 2019 and this resulted in higher domestic availability. Wheat inflation, however, remained high at an average of 6.8 per cent during April-August 2019 (3.4 per cent in 2018-19) due to a fall in imports following a hike in import duty to 40.0 per cent in April 2019 from 30.0 per cent in May 2018. As regards vegetables (weight of 6.0 per cent in CPI and 13.2 per cent in the food and beverages group), a recovery in the prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes (which account for 36.5 per cent of the total CPI vegetables) led the upturn in prices (Chart II.8a). Potato price pressures picked up right from April 2019. First, untimely rains during February and March in West Bengal impacted the crop which was ready to be harvested. Second, mandi arrivals declined due to a sudden increase in temperature during summer months and thunderstorms in several parts of northern and north-eastern states that spoiled the produce in transit. Despite this firming up, potato prices moved into deflation beginning April 2019 on account of favourable base effects. Onion prices, which had declined during December 2018-March 2019, revived from April with a sharp uptick during June-August. A reduction in rabi onion acreage in Maharashtra, particularly in the major onion-producing district of Nashik due to drought-like conditions, led to a slump in mandi arrivals. Onion prices were also supported by procurement operations by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) in Maharashtra. Excessive rainfall, coupled with floods in several parts of major onion-supplying states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh during July-August, also led to a reduction in supplies. Tomato prices began picking up from March 2019, with inflation in this item rising sharply to 70.1 per cent in May 2019 from (-) 52.2 per cent in November 2018. Delayed harvesting in Maharashtra as well as fungus damaged crops in Karnataka triggered the initial uptick in prices, which was exacerbated by supply disruptions due to incessant rains and flood- like situations in key supplier states \u2013 Karnataka, Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh. Tomato inflation, however, eased to 28.4 per cent in July largely due to a favourable base effect, before hardening to 39.4 per cent in August on account of an adverse base effect. A decomposition of CPI vegetables into trend, cyclical and seasonal components reveals that the cyclical upswing, starting from December 2018, was the key driver of the vegetables inflation during H1:2019-20 (till July 2019), with the trend component remaining flat. The seasonal uptick during the summer season tracked the pattern in previous years (Chart II.8b). Prices of fruits (weight of 2.9 per cent in CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages group) moved into deflation in December 2018. Fruits prices began rising from February 2019 with sharp uptick in April and July. However, fruits remained in deflation up to August 2019. Price pressures were particularly evident in respect of bananas and apples, which together constitute around 35.6 per cent of the category of fruits. While banana prices were impacted by lower mandi arrivals, apple prices increased in the usual seasonal upturn. Apple prices were also supported by lower imports following the increase in import duty on apples from the US by 20.0 per cent in June 2019. However, price pressures in respect of both bananas and apples declined in August due to higher domestic arrivals in mandis. The rise in prices of vegetables and fruits during the summer months of 2019 was witnessed in urban as well as rural areas. A sectoral analysis suggests that there is no statistically significant difference between the m-o-m changes in prices of fruits and vegetables between rural and urban areas. There is, however, CPI pulses (weight of 2.4 per cent in CPI and 5.2 per cent in the food and beverages group), driven by a sustained uptick in prices, emerged from 29 successive months of deflation in May 2019 to reach a 35-month high inflation of 6.9 per cent in August 2019 (Chart II.9a). Even so, the CPI pulses index remained below trend (Chart II.9b). Pulses production was lower at 234 lakh tonnes (as per the fourth advance estimates) in 2018-19 than 254 lakh tonnes in 2017-18. In addition, pulses imports declined from 57 lakh tonnes in 2017- 18 to 26 lakh tonnes in 2018-19, reducing the domestic supply glut. A sizeable stock of pulses \u2013 at around 40 lakh tonnes \u2013 is available, which could be released in the market to contain price pressures. Meat and fish prices also contributed to the pick-up in food inflation, partly reflecting the sustained rise in feed prices, particularly of maize. In fact, inflation in meat and fish prices was the highest in 62 months in July 2019. While egg prices moved in line with their historical pattern, those of milk and products hardened during May-August 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in retail milk prices by \u20b92 per litre to \u20b96 per litre due to pass-through of an increase in procurement prices of milk by \u20b95-6 per litre by milk co-operatives. 5 Based on a F-test and t-test framework. The robustness of the results was tested using both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted data. Prices of sugar emerged out of deflation in May 2019 after remaining in negative territory for 15 consecutive months. However, they slipped back into deflation during June-August 2019, reflecting domestic supply surpluses as well as favourable base effects. As per the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the opening stock of sugar as on October 1, 2019 is expected to be at an all-time high of 145 lakh tonnes. International sugar prices, which were in deflation during May 2017-February 2019 due to persistent excess global supply, also returned to positive territory in March 2019. Some increase in sugar prices in the domestic market was observed in Q1:2019-20, possibly reflecting the increase in minimum selling prices of sugar by \u20b92 per kilogram in February 2019. Inflation in respect of oils and fats remained subdued at around 0.8 per cent during April-August 2019, with soft international prices and higher domestic production keeping prices under check. According to the fourth advance estimates, oilseeds production increased by 2.5 per cent in 2018-19; however, a decline in groundnut production during the year contributed to price pressures in groundnut oil during a major part of 2018-19 as well as in 2019-20 so far. Fuel group inflation moderated sequentially after April up to June and sank into deflation in July and August 2019, with inflation in major constituents such as electricity, LPG, firewood and chips and dung cake all slipping into negative territory (Chart II.10a). After registering price increases between March- June, domestic LPG prices declined abruptly in July and August, following a collapse in international petroleum products prices (Chart II.10b). Electricity prices, which constitute around one-third of the fuel and light sub-group, have been in deflation for most of the months since January 2019. Prices of items of rural consumption such as firewood and chips, and dung cake have also remained in deflation since April 2019. This could partly be on account of increased LPG use in rural areas.6 In contrast, administered kerosene prices registered calibrated increases as oil marketing companies (OMCs) raised administered prices to align them more closely with market prices so as to eventually phase out the subsidy on petroleum products. 2019, it was not sustained and it moderated by about 30 bps in August (Chart II.11). CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated by close to 100 bps between March and June 2019. Even excluding volatile components such as petroleum products, gold and silver, it moderated by around 70 bps, reflecting the broad-based nature of the disinflation in this group. Although inflation excluding food and fuel picked up by 35 bps in July Within CPI excluding food and fuel, price increases during the financial year so far have been considerably lower than historical averages for most of the constituent sub-groups (Chart II.12). Empirical evidence suggests that persistently low food inflation has spilled over to CPI excluding food and fuel (Box II.1). 6 Rural households were provided LPG connections under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), which significantly improved the LPG coverage (all India) from 62 per cent in 2015-16 to 94 per cent in 2018-19. Estimates suggest that this could have contributed to around 1.60 percentage points reduction in inflation in traditional sources of cooking fuels like firewood and chips and dung cakes. Movements in food inflation have direct and indirect effects on headline inflation \u2013 directly through the relative weight of food in the CPI basket, and indirectly by second round effects through changes in inflation expectations, wages and relative price adjustments (Cecchetti and Moessner, 2008). Empirical results based on cross-country evidence suggest that volatile and persistent food price shocks in economies having a large share of expenditure on food in the consumption basket are likely to have larger and longer effects of food inflation on non- food inflation (Walsh, 2011). These spillovers could be time dependent and conditioned by the state of the economy. A time-varying parameter vector autoregression with stochastic volatility (TVP-VAR), (Primiceri, 2005), was employed to estimate the time- varying pass-through coefficients. It is based on five variables, viz., the output gap (deviation of output from its potential level, y); food inflation ; ; the policy inflation excluding food and fuel interest rate (i) (proxied by the call money rate, which is the operating target of monetary policy), and the exchange rate (Indian Rupees per US$) changes (z), over the sample period from Q1:1996-97 to Q1:2019-20.7 The estimated model can be represented as follows: Let Yt denote a n \u00d71 vector variables at time t. Then, Yt = Xt \u03b2t + At Where Xt = Is\u2297(Yt-1\u2019\u2026 Yt-s\u2019); at = (a21, a31, a32, a41, . . . , a54) is a stacked vector of the lower-triangular elements in At; ht = (h1t, . . . , hkt) with hjt = log\u03c32 jt for j = 1, . . . , k, t = s+1, . . . , n and \u03b2t be the vector of coefficients. It is assumed that parameters in (1) follow a random walk process as in (2). \u03a3 a 0 The empirical results suggest that (i) pass-through coefficients are time varying \u2013 ranging between 8 per cent and 14 per cent during Q3:2003-04 to Q1:2019- 20; (ii) pass-through is high when food inflation is high and persistent, and low when food inflation is low. In the recent low food inflation scenario, the pass-through coefficient has moderated to around 10 per cent (Chart II.1.1a & b). In view of this asymmetric impact of food inflation on inflation excluding food 7 CPI food price and CPI excluding food and fuel price indices, prior to 2011 were estimated using the corresponding indices of CPI Industrial Workers. and fuel, maintaining low and stable food prices becomes critical to contain underlying inflation pressures. This would entail supply side reforms to ensure that food inflation remains under check. group moderated primarily due to a sustained deflation remains considerable due to an incomplete pass- An examination of the components of CPI excluding goods and services shows that while goods inflation uptick (June-August), services inflation has fallen persistently (Chart II.14a & b). A key sub-group clothing and footwear, mainly in rural areas. Other sub-groups contributing to the goods moderation were personal care items, particularly, gold; silver; and toiletries, and household goods and services items. The pick-up in goods inflation since June has almost entirely emanated from the personal care and effects sub-group, driven by a sharp pick-up in gold prices. Services inflation moderated from elevated levels in February 2019 to 4.9 per cent in August 2019 (Chart II.14b) in a broad-based manner across education services like tuition and coaching; transportation fares, particularly, bus fares; medical services; housing; and household services like sweeping and tailoring charges. contributing to the downturn in goods inflation was Inflation in sectoral CPIs, i.e., for industrial workers (CPI-IW), agricultural labourers (CPI-AL) and rural labourers (CPI-RL), rose rapidly between March and June 2019 compared with the muted uptick in CPI headline inflation. Inflation in food and fuel components of CPI-AL and CPI-RL was higher than that in headline CPI and was accentuated by the larger share of food in these indices. In the case of CPI-IW, a major source of divergence was the housing component. Following the increase in HRA under the 7th central pay commission (CPC), housing inflation in CPI-IW remained above 26 per cent during July 2018 to June 2019, pushing CPI-IW inflation to 8.7 per cent by May 2019. As the effect of increase in HRA waned, CPI-IW inflation declined to 6.3 per cent in August. Inflation in wholesale price index (WPI) fell steadily in contrast to the sectoral CPIs to a low of 1.1 per cent in August 2019. On the one hand, fuel group inflation collapsed from 4.6 per cent in March to (-) 4.0 per cent in August 2019 tracking international petroleum product prices; inflation in non-food manufactured products also fell across the board and was in contraction in August. On the other hand, WPI food inflation showed an uptick from January and remained elevated till August, barring a fleeting correction in July. GDP and GVA deflators broadly remained in alignment with CPI inflation during the last six months (Chart II.15a). Underlying inflation dynamics can be gauged from remove volatile exclusion-based measures items/item groups or by statistical measures such as trimming, which adjust for positive and negative skewness and chronic fat tails in the inflation distribution by removing outliers. By these measures, inflation have moved with a softening bias over the last six months (Chart II.11 & 15b). Developments in underlying cost conditions have largely been in sync with inflation in terms of the WPI (Chart II.16). Price inflation in farm inputs and industrial raw materials (extracted from the WPI) has fallen in 2019-20 so far. The moderation in global crude oil prices during 2019-20 has kept domestic price pressures under check in respect of inputs such as high-speed diesel, aviation turbine fuel, naphtha, furnace oil and petroleum coke. In addition, the contraction in mineral prices has also aided the fall in industrial input costs. Among other industrial raw materials, domestic coal inflation has subsided significantly since the beginning of 2019-20, averaging around 0.7 per cent during April-August 2019. Domestic coal prices largely moved in line with international coal prices during the period. Inflation in paper and paper products has also moderated due to lower raw material costs including those of pulp and coal. In the case of fibres, inflation eased during June-August 2019, predominantly reflecting the easing in prices of raw jute and raw cotton. Of farm sector inputs, price pressures in respect of fertilisers remained subdued, largely reflecting moderation in international prices, especially those of phosphate, di-ammonium phosphate and triple superphosphate. Inflation in respect of pesticides and other agrochemical products also softened considerably to easing of in Q1:2019-20 due international crude oil prices. The price of electricity, which carries a high weight in both industrial and farm inputs, moved into deflation during June-August 2019. However, inflation in fodder prices turned positive in January 2019, after remaining in deflation during August 2016-December 2018 (barring August 2017), to touch a 37-month high of 16 per cent in July 2019, before easing somewhat in August. Inflation in terms of agricultural machinery and implements costs has also remained elevated and sticky from H2:2018-19. Growth in nominal rural wages, both for agricultural and non-agricultural labourers, remained subdued and sticky, hovering around 3.7 per cent and 3.8 per cent, respectively, during 2019-20 so far, reflecting the lagged impact of moderate rural inflation, low food prices and a slowdown in the construction sector (Chart II.17). With inflation in CPI-AL and CPI-RL having picked up since February 2019, however, real rural wage growth, based on these price indices, turned negative since March 2019. Growth in organised sector staff costs showed divergent movements for services and manufacturing firms. Unit labour costs for companies in the manufacturing sector fell marginally in Q4:2018-19 but rose thereafter in Q1:2019-20 to 6.3 per cent due to a decline in the value of production, coupled with increase in staff cost.8 Unit labour cost for firms in the services sector increased marginally in the last quarter as higher growth in staff costs outpaced the growth in value of production (Chart II.18). Manufacturing firms participating in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey reported a fall in input costs in Q2:2019-20 on account of lower raw material costs. The cost of finance and salary outgoes are also expected to soften in Q2. The fall in input prices is likely to translate into a fall in selling prices in Q2. Firms polled for the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) reported a decline in input costs and selling prices sequentially from Q2:2018-19 to Q1:2019-20. However, the rate of decline in selling prices in Q1:2019-20 was sharper than that of input costs. During Q2:2019-20, both input costs and selling prices firmed up. Input cost inflation reported by firms in the services sector PMI also softened gradually from Q2:2018-19 to Q1:2019-20 but increased during the first two months of Q2:2019-20. The inflation trajectory in 2019-20 so far has been characterised by rising food inflation, with price build-ups close to historical averages and well above levels observed in recent years, driven largely by a strong summer pick-up in prices of vegetables. Going forward, however, the build-up in vegetables prices is likely to reverse with arrivals of the kharif harvest and winter supplies. The catch-up in monsoon and sowing should help mitigate price pressures in cereals. Moreover, buffer stocks of cereals are well above prescribed norms. In the case of pulses, the arrival of fresh produce in the market along with buffer stocks are also likely to keep prices under check. Going forward, domestic fuel and petroleum product prices are subject to considerable uncertainty due to geo- political developments in the Middle East. A sudden spike in crude oil and petroleum products prices remains a major upside risk in spite of weak global demand. However, given the weak domestic demand and lower input costs, inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel is likely to remain moderate. Forward looking surveys of the Reserve Bank point to weak consumer confidence and sagging demand, especially pertaining to non-essential items. Manufacturing firms see input prices as still soft and pricing power is yet to firm up as the cost of finance and salary outgoes remain muted. However, inflation expectations of households have risen somewhat. On the whole, headline CPI inflation is expected to remain within the Reserve Bank\u2019s target of 4.0 per cent during 2019-20. 8 Unit labour cost is defined as the ratio of staff cost to value of production. Aggregate demand weakened in Q1, underpinned by a slowdown in private consumption. On the supply side, a sharp deceleration in manufacturing essentially reflected weaknesses in the organised sector. Services sector growth was pulled down by \u2018financial, real estate and professional services\u2019 and construction activity. The recent measures by the Government should help kickstart the capex cycle and lead to the strengthening of domestic demand. Domestic economic activity suffered a sharp loss of pace in Q1:2019-20. Aggregate demand weakened in Q1:2019-20 by a slowdown in private consumption. On the supply side, manufacturing activity collapsed with the prolonged slowdown in the production of capital goods and consumer durables and in the services sector, construction activity slowed down markedly. Incoming data suggest that the slowdown persisted into Q2:2019-20. Measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in real gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices, the deceleration in aggregate demand in Q4:2018-19 deepened to 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, extending the sequential slowdown that set in during Q1:2018- 19 to the fifth consecutive quarter (Table III.1 and Chart III.1a). Momentum, measured by quarter-on- quarter (q-o-q) seasonally adjusted annualised GDP growth rate (SAAR), also moderated to 4.4 per cent Of the constituents of GDP, private final consumption expenditure (PFCE), the mainstay of aggregate demand, slumped, with its growth plummeting by over four percentage points in Q1:2019-20 to an eighteen-quarter low. Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) cushioned the deceleration in aggregate demand. Excluding GFCE, real GDP growth would have slid down to 4.5 per cent in Q1:2019- 20. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) remained weak in Q1:2019-20, with the capex cycle yet to gain traction. Export growth decelerated considerably in Q1:2019-20 in an uncertain external trading environment rendered hostile by trade tensions. With import growth reflecting domestic demand conditions and slowing more sharply, net exports made a positive contribution to growth after a gap of Gross fixed capital formation FRE: First Revised Estimates; PE: Provisional Estimates. *: Component-wise contributions to growth do not add up to GDP growth in the table because change in stocks, valuables and discrepancies are not included.

The actual outcome for the quarter undershot the projections by 180 basis points. First, the realised growth in private consumption demand surprised significantly on the downside, indicating that the April 2019 projection underestimated the broad-based slowdown in both rural and urban consumption. Second, GFCF growth also turned out lower than the projection on account The unexpected slump in PFCE resulted in its share falling to 55.1 per cent in Q1:2019-20 from 56.1 per cent a year ago. The slowdown in private consumption was amplified by weak growth in indicators of urban demand High have weakened in recent months as reflected in contraction in sales of passenger vehicles and (Chart III.4). production of consumer durables Among them, passenger car sales have contracted by double digits every month since April 2019, resulting in major car producers suspending factory production intermittently. A combination of factors such as higher prices due to stricter safety norms, uncertainty caused by new emission norms and the proposed switching to electric vehicles have dented the sales of passenger vehicles (Box III.1). The growth in household credit for vehicles extended by banks also moderated (Chart III.5). Domestic air passenger traffic growth remained modest in July due to grounding of a private airline, which impacted air fares and dampened demand; however, it improved in August. Going forward, passenger vehicle sales could improve with the government\u2019s recent support for the sector such as permitting the operation of Bharat Stage (BS)-IV vehicles purchased till March 31, 2020, for the entire period of registration; withdrawal of a ban on the purchase of new vehicles by government departments; and deferring the implementation of hike in the one-time registration fee until June 2020. indicators of rural demand have also Various remained weak (Chart III.6). Motorcycles and tractor sales contracted in July and August. Although the growth of consumer non-durables accelerated in July, it was driven mainly by sunflower oil. The sales growth of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, a sizeable part of which occurs in rural areas, has also been sluggish. The reasonably strong kharif foodgrains production in the first advance The downturn in the automobile sector in India, which could be attributed to several regulatory and institutional factors, was accentuated by a slowdown in demand. This has drawn considerable attention in view of the industry\u2019s role in economic activity1. An estimation framework using vector auto regressions with exogenous variables (Ludvigson, 1998) the underlying factors for the slump in the auto sector using quarterly data from Q1:2007-08 to Q1:2019- 20. In the first VARX (1): (VARX) was conducted to assess where Y = [ct, yt, st, it] is a vector of variables endogenous the simultaneous system of equations. ct is the credit demand measured as a gap between the credit disbursed by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) for automobile purchases from its long-term trend. st is the deviation of sales of commercial vehicles from its long-term trend. yt is aggregate demand measured as the output gap and it is the weighted average lending rate of SCBs. A rise in aggregate demand and credit demand are expected to increase vehicle sales. On the other hand, an increase in interest rate is expected to moderate auto sales. X = [zt, pt, d1, d2] is a vector of exogenous variables determined from outside the simultaneous system of equations, zt is the y-o-y change in INR/US$ exchange rate, pt is the y-o-y change in diesel prices, d1 is a dummy variable representing the implementation of BS-IV from April 2017. d2 is a dummy variable representing three events which happened during the second half of 2018- 19, viz., liquidity issues faced by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) post-IL&FS default, the announcement of axle load norms and implementation of insurance and safety norms. Ut is a vector of idiosyncratic errors. A similar model was estimated by using the deviation of sales of passenger cars from its long-term trend instead of sales of commercial vehicles (st) in (1). The key findings emerging from the impulse response functions (IRFs) from the two VARXs (Charts III.I.1) are: 1 The share of \u201cmanufacture of transport equipment\u201d was 12.0 per cent in manufacturing gross value added (GVA) and 2.1 per cent in overall GVA in 2017-18. (i) both commercial vehicle and passenger car sales are sensitive to aggregate demand shocks; (ii) both commercial vehicle and passenger car sales respond positively to a decline in interest rates; (iii) fuel prices have a negative The dummy, representing three events (d2) is statistically significant and explains 10 percentage points of the decline in commercial vehicle sales and 8 percentage points of the decline in passenger car sales. (iv) exchange rate depreciation affects auto sales (v) bank credit does not have any significant impact on vehicle sales; however, the reverse causation is statistically significant, i.e., sales Shocks like the slump in demand, liquidity crisis in the NBFC sector and measures to enhance safety and security norms, appear to have resulted in a downswing in the automobile sector. A slowdown in passenger car sales was also observed in the US, the Euro area, China, South Korea and Japan for a variety of reasons (Chart III.1.2). These are: (i) stricter emission norms in China and the Euro area; (ii) mandatory sales of electric vehicles by car makers in the Euro area; (iii) tepid demand due to subdued global growth; and (iv) depressed consumer confidence from escalating US-China trade tensions.

Growth in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) moderated sharply in Q4:2018-19 and Q1:2019- 20 after double digit growth in the five previous quarters. The share of GFCF in aggregate demand declined to 32.5 per cent in Q1:2019-20 from 32.8 per cent a year ago. High frequency indicators suggest that investment activity remained sluggish in Q2. Import of capital goods and production of capital goods contracted in July (Chart III.7). However, housing loans disbursed by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) remained resilient, reflecting the policy push for the affordable housing sector. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank, moderated to 73.6 per cent in Q1:2019-20 from 76.1 per cent in Q4:2018-19; seasonally adjusted CU, however, improved to 74.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20 from 74.5 per cent in Q4 (Chart III.8). The number of stalled projects in the private sector declined in Q1:2019-20, while there was some deterioration in stalled projects in the government sector in Q1 (Chart III.9). Gross capital formation has decelerated since 2011-12 due to a slowdown in investment by the private sector (Chart III.10). Underlying the latter is corporate deleveraging in select industries as reflected in improving interest coverage ratios (Chart III.11). The slowdown in investment activity was also reflected in a decline in financial flows from banks and non-banks to the commercial sector (Chart III.12; see Chapter IV for details). government strengthened as the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) and revenue deficit (RD) improved vis-\u00e0-vis the corresponding period of the previous year in terms of budget estimates (BE), mainly due to lower growth expenditure Government (GFCE) cushioned aggregate demand in Q4:2018-19 and Q1:2019-20, as pointed out earlier. During in expenditure (Table III.2). Total expenditure of the has been driven by revenue expenditure. BE: Budget Estimates. Sources: Controller General of Accounts; and Union Budget Document, 2019-20. In order to meet expenditure commitments, revenue generation is critical. On the receipts side, income tax collections gained traction during April-August 2019 (Chart III.13). Notwithstanding month-over-month fluctuations, the GST collections grew by 4.9 per cent (y-o-y) during April-September 2019. The share of State GST (SGST) collections in total GST revenue has been sizably higher than Central GST (CGST), attributable to the adjustment for input tax credit. After apportionment of integrated GST (IGST) collections, the share of CGST collections remained significantly lower than SGST collections during April-September 2018. They did move closer subsequently, before finally catching up in August 2019 (Chart III.14a and 14b). There have, however, been large inter-state variations in SGST collections, with a few states not requiring the GST compensation cess. Plugging loopholes and mitigating information technology (IT) glitches such as putting in place an invoice-matching system to facilitate a system validated input tax credit, overcoming operational deficiencies of the payment module, alignment of system validations with the GST Acts and Rules along with alleviating system design deficiencies may facilitate tapping of GST potential.2 2 Report of Comptroller and Auditor General of India on Indirect Taxes \u2013 Goods and Services Tax for the year ended March 2018, Report No. 11, July, 2019. Non-tax revenue has been an important source of finance for the central government. During April- August 2019, this component witnessed robust growth driven by the surplus transfer from the Reserve Bank. Resource mobilising efforts through disinvestment may also help garner revenues, going forward. of the capital expenditure multiplier (RBI, 2019).3 A major challenge for government finances in the remaining period of the current financial year is to adhere to the budgeted capital spending and revenue generation targets. On the expenditure front, both revenue and capital expenditure of the central government witnessed some moderation in Q1:2019-20. However, after the declaration of election results, both revenue and capital expenditure picked up significantly during July-August 2019; almost 40 per cent of budgeted capital expenditure for roads and highways was incurred in the month of July 2019. Likewise, information available for 22 states indicates a slowdown in revenue expenditure in Q1:2019-20 though it picked up in July 2019. States have reduced their capital spending in order to adhere to fiscal deficit targets in the last few years (Chart III.15). This seems to have, in turn, affected investment adversely. Going forward, a pick-up in capital spending by both the centre and states is desirable given the growth augmenting property As regards direct taxes of states, stamp duty collections are highly correlated with construction activity (Chart III.16). Hence, a slowdown in the construction sector might impact stamp duty collections. After remaining above 6 per cent of GDP between 2008-09 to 2016-17, the combined GFD of the centre and states dropped below 6 per cent in 2017-18. It is estimated at 6.2 per cent in 2018-19 (RE) and 5.9 per cent in 2019-20 (BE). Outstanding liabilities of the general government are budgeted to marginally decline to 69.6 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 from 69.8 per cent in 2018-19, driven by the centre, though states\u2019 debt is showing a rising trend. The debt servicing capacity of the general government has improved in 2018-19 with the interest payments as per cent to revenue receipts exhibiting a decline. The Reserve Bank has managed the centre\u2019s market borrowing programme during 2019-20 so far as per the planned issuance schedule. The budgeted gross market borrowing of the central government for 2019-20 at \u20b97,10,000 crore is about 24.3 per cent higher than last year. The central government completed 62.3 per cent of its budgeted gross market borrowings as on September 30, 2019 (50.4 per cent in the corresponding period of 2018-19) (Table III.3). The Union Budget 2019-20 provides for consolidation measures like switching of securities budgeted at \u20b950,000 crore, of which \u20b940,109 crore worth of securities have already been switched. The states completed 35.6 per cent of their budgeted gross market borrowings till September 30, 2019 as compared with 27.6 per cent in the corresponding period of 2018-19. A major part of market borrowings by the states is expected to occur in H2:2019-20. Q2:2016-17, as slowdown in import growth was more pronounced than that for exports. The persisting loss of momentum in global trade impacted India\u2019s merchandise exports, which contracted during Q1:2019-20 and in July-August 2019-20 in both the petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) and non-POL categories (Chart III.17a). The sectors which contributed to the overall decline included engineering goods, gems and jewellery and rice. POL exports declined mainly on account of a fall in international crude oil prices. In addition, routine maintenance-related shutdowns in major refineries adversely impacted exports in June 2019 (Chart III.18a). Net exports contributed positively to aggregate demand in Q1:2019-20 for the first time after Imports also contracted in Q1:2019-20 due to deceleration in POL growth and decline in non-POL non-gold imports. Gold imports surged on the back of a decline in prices, wedding and festive season demand during Q1:2019-20 (Chart III.18b). The decline in non- POL non-gold imports was broad-based as imports of transport equipment, pearls and precious stones, metalliferous ores and vegetable oil contracted. Imports continued to contract in July-August 2019 in a broad-based manner. The trade deficit moderated from US$ 46.7 billion in Q1:2018-19 to US$ 46.2 billion in Q1:2019-20, although on a sequential basis, i.e., Q1:2019-20 over Q4:2018-19, it expanded modestly. However, with imports declining faster than exports, the trade deficit narrowed from US$ 36.5 billion in July-August 2018-19 to US$ 26.9 billion in the corresponding period of 2019-20. While the current account deficit (CAD) mirrored the movements in the trade deficit, both on a y-o-y and sequential basis, CAD as per cent of GDP widened to 2 per cent in Q1:2019-20 from below one per cent in Q4:2018-19. More than 80 per cent of the trade deficit was financed through invisibles, i.e., net export of services and remittances. Net services exports grew by 7.3 per cent in Q1:2019-20 on a y-o-y basis \u2013 primarily driven by software, travel and financial services (Chart III.17b). Revenue growth of major information technology (IT) companies making software exports, improved on a y-o-y basis in Q1:2019-20; an increase of 0.6 per cent in total global IT spending is projected in 2019. Remittances remained stronger in Q1:2019- 20, though the net outgo of payments under income account increased due to higher dividends on foreign The CAD was comfortably met by a mix of foreign direct 14.0 billion. Higher FPI flows, including under the voluntary retention route (VRR) introduced in March 2019, eased external financing conditions. Net inflows of US$ 1.5 billion a year ago. Net FDI flows at US$ 13.9 billion in Q1:2019-20 were higher than US$ 9.6 billion a year ago. Easing of norms for FDI in single are likely to give a push to FDI inflows and strengthen Notwithstanding outflows from the equity segment in July and August 2019, net FPI purchases (excluding VRR) in the domestic capital market were at US$ 3.3 under non-resident deposits were robust in Q1:2019- US$ 434.6 billion on October 1, 2019 \u2013 an increase On the supply side, the gross value added (GVA) growth decelerated to 5.7 per cent in Q4:2018-19 and Q1:2019-20 (Table III.4). GVA momentum, measured in terms of seasonally adjusted q-o-q annualised growth, also declined sharply in Q1 (Chart III.19).

In terms of distribution, 12 sub-divisions (compared to 1 sub-division last year) received excess rainfall, 19 received normal rainfall (23 sub-divisions last year), and 5 suffered deficient rainfall (12 sub-divisions last year) (Chart III.22). Abundant rains between mid- August and September augmented the live storage available in 113 reservoirs (as on September 26, 2019) monsoon impacted crop production during 2018- crops missing their respective targets set for the sugarcane touched a record high in 2018-19. In 2019, the south-west monsoon started with a central India was hindered by cyclone Vayu. As a result, there was a rainfall deficit of 36 per cent below gained momentum from July. Heavy rainfall in the beginning of the month reduced the cumulative deficit September 30, 2019 was 10 per cent above the LPA in The production weighted rainfall index5 (PRN) was also higher than a year ago and was \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018above normal\u2019 for all the major crops, barring rice (Chart III.23). 9.5 per cent lower as on June 28, 2019 than a year ago. However, sowing recovered thereafter, with an improvement in precipitation across the country and announcement of minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops. As a result, the total area sown caught up with last year\u2019s average as on September 27, 2019 (Chart III.24a). At a disaggregated level, sowing caught up across all crops, exceeding last year\u2019s levels in respect of cotton and pulses (Chart III.24b). Reflecting the initial delay in the onset of the monsoon, kharif sowing started on a low note with acreage for most crops lagging behind the area sown last year. The total area sown under kharif crops was The first advance estimates of production of major kharif crops for 2019-20 have placed foodgrains production at 1,406 lakh tonnes, 0.8 per cent lower 5 The All India production-weighted rainfall index (PRN) for a crop (total foodgrains) is constructed as a ratio of the weighted averages of state-wise actual rainfall and IMD normal rainfall, expressed as a percentage.

However, among the commercial crops, the production of oil seeds, cotton, jute and mesta has been estimated to be higher than last year\u2019s production. The slowdown in industrial activity that set in from Q2:2018-19 deepened further in Q1:2019-20 GVA in Q1:2019-20 essentially reflected weaknesses in the organised sector. In terms of the index of The MSPs announced for the kharif season 2019-20 ensure a return of at least 50 per cent over the cost of production (as measured by A2 plus FL6) for all the crops (Table III.5). However, the growth in MSP in 2019-20 for kharif crops over last year\u2019s level of support price was modest (in the range of 1.1-9.2 per cent) as compared with a range of 3.7-52.5 per cent in 2018-19. While the highest increase in the MSP was for soyabean (9.2 per cent), followed by ragi (8.7 per cent), the lowest was for niger seeds and moong (1.1 per cent). of manufacturing improved in Q1:2019-20 from the previous quarter. In July, manufacturing output accelerated further (Chart III.26). intermediate goods sector grew by double digits for the third consecutive month in July 2019, mainly driven by mild steel slabs. Consumer non-durables growth also accelerated, supported by sunflower oil production. However, the capital goods sector contracted for the 6 A2 plus FL includes all paid out costs such as expenses on hired labour, machines, rent paid for leased land, seeds, fertilisers, irrigation charges, depreciation as well as imputed value of family labour. 7 IIP at the appropriate digit level is taken into account to represent the unorganised manufacturing sector in the quarterly GVA estimates. seventh successive month, caused by contraction in commercial vehicles, tractors and printing machinery. sources was lower in July and August on a y-o-y basis (Charts III.28). The consumer durables segment contracted for two consecutive months, pulled down by a decline in the Electricity generation accelerated in Q1:2019-20 due to increased summer demand following the delayed onset of the monsoon. With the seasonal The deceleration in manufacturing GVA in Q1:2019-20 was also reflected in sales growth of manufacturing companies, pulled down mainly by lower sales of automobiles, petroleum, and iron and steel (Chart III. 29). The slowdown in sales also mirrored in a sharp decline in profit before tax (Chart III. 30). A silver lining was witnessed in the sales of cement, pharmaceuticals and chemical companies, which continued to grow in Q1:2019-20. manufacturing sector has deteriorated recently. Business expectations index (BEI) also moderated to The business assessment index (BAI) fell to 92.5 in manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for September 2019 was unchanged at its previous improved, albeit, marginally, new export orders declined. In Q1:2019-20, services sector growth was the lowest in the last seven quarters, pulled down by financial, activity. PADO grew at a healthy rate in Q1:2019-20 and cushioned the loss of pace of GVA from overall and services related to broadcasting\u2019 maintained have weakened significantly in the recent period. The two-wheelers contracted sharply in July-August. Growth in domestic air passenger traffic accelerated in August. While rail freight traffic contracted in July, domestic air cargo traffic growth improved in August (Chart III.31a and b). The services PMI, however, the expanded contraction in June. July and August, reversing Of the two key indicators of construction activity, the production of cement accelerated sharply in July before contracting in August, while finished steel consumption moderated in July-August (Chart III.32). Softer domestic steel prices are likely to strengthen steel consumption, going forward. PADO growth moderated sequentially in Q1:2019- 20, reflecting subdued revenue expenditure (net of interest payments and subsidies) of the union and the state governments ahead of elections. The growth of \u2018financial, real estate and professional services\u2019 decelerated in Q1:2019-20 mainly due to the poor performance by listed real estate companies notwithstanding a healthy growth in financial services (Chart III.33). In the residential real estate sector, both sales and new launches contracted in Q1:2019-20, indicating sluggish demand (Chart III.34a). With sales outpacing new launches, the inventory overhang has declined somewhat, though the large inventory overhang still has a moderating influence on residential house prices (Chart III.34b). A detailed analysis of aggregate demand and aggregate supply in the above sections provides an assessment of the state of the economy in H1:2019-20. The output gap \u2013 measured by the deviation of actual output from its potential level and expressed as a ratio of potential output \u2013 provides a summary measure in the economy. of demand-supply conditions Since potential output and the output gap are both unobservable and their estimates can be sensitive to the choice of methodology and data availability, a pragmatic approach has been followed by applying several methods to estimate potential output. The methods followed are univariate filters such as the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, the Baxter-King (BK) filter and the Christiano-Fitzgerald (CF) filter on the one hand, and multivariate Kalman filter (MVKF) taking into account inflation developments, on the other, to draw robust inferences on the state of the business cycle (Chart III.35). The composite estimate arrived by combining all these measures suggests that the output gap has turned more negative. A combination of domestic and global headwinds has depressed economic activity, especially in terms of aggregate demand. The near-term outlook of the Indian economy is fraught with several risks. First, private consumption, which all along supported economic activity, is now beginning to slow down due to a host of factors. In this context, the performance of large employment generating sectors such as automobile and real estate remains less than satisfactory. Recent measures initiated such as the sharp cut in corporate tax rates, stressed assets funds for the housing sector, infrastructure investment funds, implementation of a fully electronic GST refund system and funds for export guarantee would be helpful. Second, bank credit growth has slowed down and overall fund flows to the commercial sector have declined, partly due to risk aversion and partly due to a slowdown in demand. The recent recapitalisation of public sector banks augurs well for improving credit flows, which are important for reviving private investment activity. Meanwhile, investment global uncertainties have weakened activity at home. Further escalation of trade tensions could adversely impact export prospects, besides delaying the investment upturn. The private corporate sector has not been adding new capacities even as existing capacity utilisation has risen close to its long- term average for several quarters. The recent measures should help kickstart the capex cycle so that new capacities can come on stream and lead to the strengthening of domestic demand in the short-term while boosting the medium-term growth potential of the economy. Domestic financial market segments reacted to evolving domestic and global developments in a diverse manner in the first half of 2019-20. While money markets experienced swift and complete transmission of policy impulses, the government securities and foreign exchange market segments were impacted by domestic economic slowdown and global spillovers. The stock market intermittently scaled new highs amidst sell-off pressures from geo-political tensions. In the credit market, bank lending decelerated reflecting weak demand and risk aversion. Global financial markets were on edge through the first indicators in Q2. Rising global uncertainty amidst flashpoints, uncertainty surrounding a chaotic Brexit and a subdued global growth outlook, despite dovish in the economy adversely impacted the foreign monetary policy stances of leading central banks. to the commercial sector moderated mainly due to volatility with stocks of emerging market economies reduced credit offtake from banks reflecting weak (EMEs) undergoing sell-offs on fears of political widened as global growth prospects dimmed; on the other hand, ebbing risk appetite coupled with market were impacted by the RBI\u2019s monetary policy accommodative monetary policy stances resulted in In the currency market, the US dollar continued to rate (WACR) generally remained below the policy repo appreciate against other major currencies, reflecting (see Section IV.3 for details). The spread between the EME currencies depreciated amidst mounting WACR and the policy repo rate widened from June, spillover risks arising from trade tensions and market and averaged 6 bps in September. Other overnight exhibited divergent movements in response to evolving domestic and global developments in H1:2019-20. While money markets witnessed swift moved largely in tandem with the WACR. Both the tri-party repo rate and the market repo rate remained Volumes in the inter-bank money market shifted yields in bond markets was interrupted by domestic from the uncollateralised to the collateralised segment during H1:2019-20. The progressive easing made handsome gains in Q1, with the election of liquidity conditions led to a fall in the share of related uncertainty coming to an end, but suffered call money in total overnight money market volume. repo in total money market volumes increased (Chart IV.1).1 In terms of market microstructure, mutual funds (MFs) continued to be the major lenders in the tri- party repo and market repo segments, with average shares of 59 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively, in H1:2019-20. The major borrowers were public sector banks in the tri-party repo segment and primary dealers (PDs) in the market repo segment. Given deficit liquidity conditions in April and May, lending by MFs declined while borrowing by MFs increased in the collateralised segment during these two months. With systemic liquidity turning surplus since June, lending by MFs increased while borrowing declined marginally in the collateralised segment during June- September. Interest longer-term money market instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial papers (CPs) and Treasury Bills (T-bills) of 3-month maturity responded in varying degrees 1 In the call money market, participants include banks and primary dealers only, while other market participants such as mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions are the key players in the tri-party repo and market repo segments. to policy rate cuts and the shift in the policy stance from neutral to accommodative during H1:2019- 20 (Chart IV.2). Interest rates on CPs moderated noticeably during H1, particularly those issued by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), although CP rates traded above CD rates. In comparison, yields on 3-month T-bills moderated by a greater extent during the period. In the wake of easy liquidity conditions in the banking system, fresh issuances of CDs declined to \u20b91,75,305 crore during H1:2019-20 (up to September 13, 2019) as compared with \u20b91,98,829 crore during the corresponding period of 2018-19. Primary issuances of CPs also declined to \u20b911,92,277 crore during H1:2019-20 from \u20b913,58,117 crore during H1:2018- 19, with more than 99 per cent of the issuances by companies with A1+ rating. CP issuances moderated from July reflecting heightened risk aversion in view of downgrading of a few CP issuers in June and July 2019. Nevertheless, interest rates in the primary CP market \u2013 as reflected in the weighted average discount rate (WADR) \u2013 moderated sharply by 130 bps during H1:2019-20, facilitated by the easing of liquidity conditions (Chart IV.3a). During this period, non-financial corporates and NBFCs were the major in liquidity conditions from deficit to surplus since of issuances by top rated issuers raising funds at between 3-month CPs and 3-month T-bills) remained competitive rates; and (iii) the measures taken by the high at an average of 99 bps during April-July reflecting government and the Reserve Bank to provide liquidity support to NBFCs.2 The spread between 3-month CP IV.4a). The risk premium declined sharply to an notwithstanding some intermittent spikes (Chart of (i) the liquidity effect emanating from the switch 2 The Union Budget on July 5, 2019 announced that the government would provide a one-time partial credit guarantee to public sector banks to buy high- rated pooled assets worth \u20b91 lakh crore from NBFCs. Moreover, the Reserve Bank in its bi-monthly monetary policy of August 2019 allowed bank lending to NBFCs for on-lending to agriculture, micro and small enterprises, and housing to be classified as priority sector lending, up to specified limits. The RBI also liberalised the external commercial borrowings framework, which facilitated NBFCs to raise funds for on-lending and repayment of rupee loans. During H1:2019-20, policy transmission was nearly Amidst heightened trade tensions, yields softened the three policy announcements during this period, the maximum impact was felt after the June policy \u2013 which signaled both a rate cut and a change in the stance from neutral to accommodative \u2013 particularly at the longer end of the money market spectrum (Table IV.1). Thus, both the announcement effect of repo rate cuts and the liquidity effect of surplus conditions were instrumental in securing policy transmission. results indicating political stability. This was aided prices. The softening trend continued in June with the benchmark yield declining further by 15 bps during the month, as market sentiment was buoyed the policy stance and continued OMO purchases by The moderation in yields extended into Q2 even G-sec yields traded with a softening bias at the beginning of Q1:2019-20, taking cues from several positive developments during Q4:2018-19, viz., monetary policy easing and a change in the policy stance to neutral; injection of durable liquidity; announcement of the voluntary retention route (VRR); and successive benign inflation prints. The softening of yields was, however, ephemeral and they started hardening in April 2019, partly due to (i) no change in the policy stance contrary to market expectation; (ii) sustained higher crude oil prices after the US announced stopping of imports from Iran and supply disruptions in Libya and Venezuela; and (iii) depreciation of the Indian rupee (INR). Consequently, the benchmark yield hardened by 6 bps during April 2019 despite injection of durable liquidity through a US dollar buy/ sell swap. from calibrated tightening as the market sentiment was unsettled by fears of excess supply of paper. In fact, G-Sec yields remained fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent of GDP and unchanged quantum of borrowing vis-\u00e0-vis the Interim Budget bolstered market sentiment. This was also reflected in renewed buying by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) in the debt market. Moreover, benign inflation prints triggered market expectations of further rate cuts. All these factors resulted in the benchmark yield softening further by 50 bps during July, touching a low of 6.33 per cent on July 16, 2019 \u2013 its lowest level such as a larger than expected rate cut of 35 bps than expected surplus transfer by the RBI, the G-sec market remained wary in August on concerns over the bond yields. Subsequent reassurances by Saudi authorities on restoring normalcy assuaged market apprehensions somewhat and softened crude prices thereafter. Moreover, large buying support from state owned banks, market expectation of a further rate cut and easing of limit on foreign investment in gilts softened yields towards the end of September. Overall, the benchmark yield softened by 65 bps during H1:2019-20, closing at 6.70 per cent on September 30, 2019. fiscal slippage arising from anticipation of a stimulus, benchmark yield hardened by 19 bps during August 2019, paring previous gains (Chart IV.5). The hardening bias of benchmark yield continued in September owing to (i) rising crude oil prices following the attack on Saudi oil refineries; (ii) lingering fiscal concerns; and (iii) surge in overnight indexed swap (OIS) rates fuelled by a rise in US The yield curve, which underwent shifts in H1:2019-20, is characterised by its level and slope (Chart IV.6a).3 Since the April monetary policy level of yield has announcement, the average softened by 50 bps, driven down by: (i) cumulative policy easing by 85 bps, accompanied by a change in the monetary policy stance; (ii) build-up of surplus liquidity position aided by liquidity infusion through OMOs and forex buy/sell swaps; (iii) ongoing liquidity support measures to NBFCs; and (iv) benign domestic inflation prints. Since the August policy announcement (up to September 30, 2019), however, the average level has firmed up by 24 bps even as the yield curve has become steeper, reflecting inter alia fears of a large shortfall in government revenue after the announcement of corporate tax rate cuts by 3 While the level is the average of all yields across maturities, the slope is represented by the difference in yield between the longest and the shortest maturity (term spread). disruption and heightened geo-political uncertainties/ financial market turmoil in some EMEs (Chart IV.6b). The introduction of the VRR and increased investment limits for G-Sec boosted overseas investor interest in debt instruments at the beginning of 2019-20. With benign inflation prints, coupled with political stability arousing investors\u2019 appetite, FPIs remained net buyers in the G-Sec market during H1:2019-20, although they turned net sellers in September due to geo-political tensions and tepid domestic economic outlook (Chart IV.7). At the short end of the primary segment, T-bill yields softened during H1:2019-20 tracking the benchmark yield (Chart IV.8). At the longer end, issuances of state development loans (SDLs) were moderate during H1:2019-20 as against the front-loading of issuances by the GoI. The weighted average cumulative spread of SDLs\u2019 cut- offs over the corresponding tenor G-sec at 52 bps in H1:2019-20 (as on September 30) was comparable to 54 bps in H1:2018-19 (Chart IV.9). During H1:2019-20, the average inter-state spread on securities of 10-year tenor at 4 bps remained identical to that recorded in Corporate bond yields eased sharply during H1:2019- 20, largely tracking G-sec yields and reflecting yields softened by 66 basis points \u2013 from 8.10 per policy rate reduction of 85 basis points (excluding the reduction in February 2019 during the current easing cycle). Moreover, easy liquidity conditions also led to a reduction in the risk premia. Illustratively, the yield spread (5-year AAA corporate bonds over 5-year G-sec) on bonds issued by public sector undertakings (FIs) and banks, institutions (PSUs), financial NBFCs, and corporates declined by 32 bps, 20 bps and 19 bps points, respectively, during this period. State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank 5-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads \u2013 which indicate credit default risk \u2013 also declined by 23 bps and 21 bps, respectively. Resource mobilisation through issuances of corporate bonds in the primary market increased sharply by 34.4 per cent to \u20b92.6 lakh crore during April-August 2019 from \u20b91.9 lakh crore a year ago (Chart IV.10b). Almost the entire resource mobilisation in the corporate bond market (97.3 per cent) continued to be through the private placement route. Investments by FPIs in corporate bonds declined to \u20b92.03 lakh crore at end- September 2019 from \u20b92.19 lakh crore at end-March 2019. Consequently, FPIs\u2019 utilisation of the approved limit for investment in corporate bonds came down to 64.0 per cent at end-September 2019 from 75.9 per cent at end-March 2019. The average daily turnover in the corporate bond market increased to \u20b98,261 Equity markets scaled records in the immediate aftermath of the 2019 general elections. Thereafter, they corrected during Q2:2019-20 due to a combination of domestic and global factors which dampened market sentiment, closing at about the same level as at the beginning of the year (Chart IV.11a). The BSE Sensex registered modest gains in April 2019, aided by continued FPI inflows, the policy repo rate cut by the RBI and positive global cues, notwithstanding weak corporate earnings results. Markets witnessed a sharp downturn during early May 2019 as trade tensions between the US and China intensified. Investor sentiment, however, turned positive later in the month buoyed by the prospects of a stable government and expectations of further monetary easing by the RBI. Market exuberance pushed the BSE Sensex to a record high of 40268 on June 3, 2019 but this rally proved transient as sentiment turned bearish after a default by a housing finance company triggered liquidity concerns in the NBFC sector. The downtrend deepened in July over some Budget proposals such as (i) tax on super rich; (ii) buyback tax; and (iii) continued FPI outflows due to the proposed increase in tax surcharge for FPIs registered as non-corporates exacerbated the decline in July 2019. While FPIs were net sellers to the tune of \u20b9605 crore in the equity market, domestic institutional investors, particularly MFs, made heavy purchases amounting to \u20b950,316 crore during H1: 2019-20 (Chart IV.11b). In the primary segment of the equity market, resource mobilisation through public and rights issues grew nearly five times to \u20b959,618 crore during April- August 2019 as compared with \u20b912,028 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. The equity market declined marginally in August trade negotiations completely nullified the positive registration fees for automobiles. The BSE Sensex surged nearly 5 per cent on September 20 spurred by the reduction in the corporate tax rate \u2013 the biggest rally in over a decade. Subsequently, the BSE Sensex corrected on concerns about the health of the the US. Overall, the BSE Sensex registered a gain of Since April 2019, the INR traded with a depreciating bias, dipping to a low of \u20b972.19 per US dollar (reference rate) on September 3, 2019. The fall in the INR was in line with many EME currencies experiencing depreciation vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar, which was pronounced in August and September. Overall, the fall in the INR during April-September 2019 was due to equity sell-offs by FPIs and strengthening of the US dollar, triggered by rising risk aversion among investors on escalating US-China trade tensions and concerns over tepid global growth. While the INR depreciated by 2.1 per cent vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar on September 30, 2019 over end-March 2019, it was modest in comparison with the depreciation of many of its EME peers such as the Malaysian ringgit, the South African rand, the Chinese yuan and the Brazilian real (Chart IV.12a). exchange rate (NEER), the INR appreciated by 0.4 per 2019 over March (average) 2019. Similarly, the INR, exchange rate (REER), appreciated during the same and August 2019 was modest as compared with that In the credit market, offtake during the year (up to mid-September) has been muted; both, low momentum and unfavourable base effects dragged down non-food credit growth (Chart IV.13). The seasonal decline in credit during Q1:2019-20 was more pronounced than in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The offtake during Q2 (up to mid-September) has been subdued as compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous two years. Of the incremental non-food credit flow during the year (August 2019 over August 2018), personal loans accounted for the largest share, followed by services and industry (Chart IV.15b). Within personal loans, credit offtake has been broadly concentrated in two segments, viz., housing and credit card outstanding. Within industry, credit growth to beverages and tobacco, cement, engineering, vehicles, construction and infrastructure (viz., power, telecommunications and roads) accelerated. The slowdown in credit growth was led by public sector banks and private sector banks, while credit growth of foreign banks continued to be modest, despite some uptick in the recent period (Chart IV.14). While credit growth to agriculture and personal loans remained broadly unchanged in the last one year, credit growth to industry moderated in the last four months after accelerating continuously between August 2018 and April 2019. Credit growth to services has decelerated sharply since January 2019 (Chart IV.15a). Credit quality has deteriorated with both the stressed assets ratio and the non-performing assets (NPA) ratio increasing marginally in June 2019 after four successive quarters of decline (Chart IV.16a). Sector-wise analysis indicates that the NPA ratio deteriorated for all sectors in June 2019, barring industry (Chart IV.16b). Banks have reduced their investment in the non- statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) portfolio by about \u20b935,000 crore in 2019-20 (up to September 13). This is notwithstanding a marginal increase in exposure to CPs in contrast to a decline in H2:2018-19. With both non-SLR investment and non-food credit undergoing credit4 growth a decline, adjusted non-food decelerated during the year so far (Chart IV.17). 4 Includes non-food credit extended by scheduled commercial banks and their investment in commercial paper as also bonds/shares/debentures issued by private and public corporate sector. With muted credit offtake and decline in non- SLR investments, banks have augmented their SLR portfolios despite the reduction in SLR by RBI. Banks held excess SLR of 6.9 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) on August 30, 2019 as compared with 6.3 per cent of NDTL at end-March 2019 (Chart IV.18). Overall, financial flows to the commercial sector in 2019-20 so far (up to mid-September) have been lower than in the same period last year due to a decline in funding from banks and lower funding from non-bank sources. Among domestic non-bank sources of funding, public issues of equity and private placement increased significantly. Among foreign sources, both external commercial borrowings and foreign direct investment (FDI) registered sharp increases (Table IV.3). Notably, a new framework for external commercial borrowings was announced in January 2019 to improve the ease of doing business; subsequently, end-use provisions were also rationalised in July 2019. April to mid-Sep Per cent to Total Per cent to Total lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans decreased The response of deposit and lending rates of commercial banks to the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 110 bps during the easing cycle of monetary policy starting from February 2019 has been muted so far (Table IV.4). While the weighted average on outstanding rupee loans, in contrast, increased transmission essentially reflects slow adjustment in bank term deposit rates. This, in turn, reflects the The WALR on fresh rupee loans declined during February-August 2019 across bank groups, with the largest decline observed in foreign banks and the least in public sector banks (Chart IV.19). As the lending activity of public sector banks was constrained by higher NPAs and lower capital adequacy vis-\u00e0-vis private sector banks, the share of fresh rupee loans of private sector banks overtook that of PSBs in August 2019 (Chart IV.20). One of the important factors impeding monetary transmission is administered interest rates on small saving schemes set by the Government of India. These administered interest rates are linked to market interest rates on G-secs with a lag and are fixed on a quarterly basis at a spread ranging from Actual lending rates comprise marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) and a spread. Banks charged the lowest spread (WALR on outstanding rupee loans over 1-year MCLR) on housing loans during August 2019 reflecting (i) lower probability of default; (ii) availability of good collateral; and (iii) competition from NBFCs (Chart IV.21). At the other end of the spectrum, the spread charged on \u2018other personal loans\u2019 was the highest. The spread between MCLR/WALR on fresh rupee loans/outstanding rupee loans and G-sec yields has risen sharply through 2019, reflecting complete of interest on all small savings schemes (except savings deposit) were reduced by 10 bps. Even after the reduction, however, the small saving rates of various schemes continued to be higher by 18-62 bps in Q2:2019-20 than the formula-based interest rates. With the Government deciding to keep the interest rates on small savings unchanged for Q3:2019-20 notwithstanding a decline in G-sec yields in the reference period (June-August 2019), the wedge between the current small saving rates on various schemes and the formula-based rates for Q3:2019-20 has widened further to 70-110 bps (Table IV.5). 0-100 bps over and above G-sec rate of comparable maturities. Interest rates on small saving schemes were revised on June 28, 2019 for Q2: 2019-20, which came into effect from July 1, 2019 whereby the rates The MCLR system of pricing loans lacks transparency as it is internal to each bank and borrowers have no way of ascertaining as to how it has been arrived at. While it may not matter for new borrowers as they are able to compare overall lending rates across banks and take a decision in their best interest, it impacts existing borrowers as they cannot easily ascertain the factors that lead to the changes in MCLR. The MCLR $: Spreads for fixing small saving rates as per Government of India Press Release of February 16, 2016. Note: Compounding frequency varies across instruments. Sources: Government of India; and RBI staff estimates. system also did not deliver effective transmission as banks were slow to adjust their deposit interest rates which, in turn, had a bearing on their lending rates. To address these concerns, the Reserve Bank, in pursuance of the recommendations of an Internal Study Group (Chairman: Dr. Janak Raj), mandated that all scheduled commercial banks (excluding regional rural banks) should link all new floating rate personal or retail loans and floating rate loans to Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) to the policy repo rate or 3-month T-bill rate or 6-month T-bill rate or any other benchmark market interest rate published by Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd. (FBIL), effective October 1, 2019. Banks are free to choose the spread over the benchmark rate, subject to the condition that the credit risk premium may undergo change only when the borrower\u2019s credit assessment undergoes a substantial change, as agreed upon in the loan contract. External benchmarks are transparent as they are available in the public domain and hence easily accessible to the borrowers. The external benchmark framework will improve transmission as (i) the lending rates will be referenced to one of the prescribed benchmark rates for new borrowers; and (ii) banks would need to reset the benchmark rate at least once in three months for existing borrowers. through reverse repos of maturity ranging from overnight to 63 days. In addition, liquidity aggregating \u20b947,128 crore was injected through variable rate repos of maturity ranging from 1 to 3 days. Four open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions and one US$ 5 billion buy/sell swap auction was conducted by the RBI during H1:2019-20. Furthermore, the SLR was cumulatively reduced by 50 bps during H1 \u2013 25 bps each effective April 13 and July 6, respectively, \u2013 to 18.75 per cent of NDTL of banks, in accordance with the roadmap announced in December 2018 with a view to enabling banks to raise structural liquidity. RBI\u2019s forex operations including US$ 5 billion buy/ sell swap auction and net OMO purchases were the major drivers augmenting liquidity in H1:2019-20, which was absorbed through operations under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by the RBI. This contrasts with H2:2018-19 when a large expansion in currency in circulation (CiC) resulted in a leakage of liquidity from the banking system, which had to be replenished through large scale open market purchase operations and liquidity injections under the LAF The RBI Act 1934 amended in 2016 requires the RBI to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time, if any, in the public domain. During H1:2019-20, liquidity management operations by the RBI were conducted within the broad framework discussed in the Monetary Policy Reports of October 2018 and April 2019. In addition to regular operations during H1:2019-20, the RBI resorted to fine-tuning variable rate repo and reverse repo auctions. Liquidity amounting to \u20b95,09,585 crore was injected through the regular 14-day repos, while liquidity amounting to \u20b993,39,315 crore was absorbed During H1:2019-20, the increase in CiC at \u20b949,378 crore (2.3 per cent) was muted in comparison with the significantly higher increase of \u20b995,896 crore (5.2 per cent) in the corresponding period of 2018-19. As a result, growth in CiC (y-o-y) was consistently lower In April and May, liquidity conditions were in deficit demand for cash. The unwinding of GoI cash balances spending after government formation at the Centre, net forex purchases by the RBI and return of currency to the banking system post-elections. The RBI also conducted two OMO purchase auctions amounting to \u20b927,500 crore. Consequently, total injection of durable liquidity in Q1:2019-20 \u2013 through both OMOs5 and US$/INR swap auction \u2013 amounted to \u20b987,414 crore (Chart IV.25). The RBI absorbed surplus liquidity of \u20b951,710 crore on a daily net average basis under the LAF in June. \u2013 a regular feature every year in April \u2013 was much model code of conduct during elections restricting spending. Combined with rising Consequently, the RBI conducted a US$/INR buy/ sell swap auction of US$ 5 billion (\u20b934,874 crore) for a tenor of 3 years in April and two OMO purchase auctions in May amounting to \u20b925,000 crore to inject durable liquidity into the system. It also injected liquidity of \u20b951,403 crore on a daily net average basis under the LAF during these two months. Surplus liquidity conditions persisted in July on account of (i) return of currency to the banking system; and (ii) the Reserve Bank\u2019s net forex purchase operations. Although liquidity continued to be in surplus in August, its drivers were distinctly different. First, currency expansion picked up, draining systemic liquidity. Second, increasing geo- political uncertainties in EMEs from political unrest in Hong Kong and meltdown of financial markets in Argentina resulted in capital outflows necessitating forex market (sales) intervention by the RBI. These pressures were, however, more than offset by a The situation changed in June when liquidity conditions turned to surplus due to increased 5 OMOs include both purchases through auctions as well as transactions on the negotiated dealing system \u2013 order matching (NDS-OM) platform. large drawdown of GoI balances, with the Central Government resorting to ways and means advances (WMA) for a major part of the month. In September, the surplus moderated with the build-up of large government cash balances, particularly with the receipt of advance taxes after September 15 (Chart IV.26). Nevertheless, absorption of liquidity on a daily net average basis under the LAF soared to \u20b91,31,370 crore during Q2:2019-20 in contrast to a net injection of \u20b917,409 crore in Q1. Simultaneously, transient liquidity needs were met through variable rate repos of smaller tenors (1-3 days) in addition to the regular 14-day term repos. To sum up, the RBI\u2019s forex operations and currency expansion were the prime drivers of durable liquidity in the banking system in H1:2019-20, while government spending was the key driver of frictional liquidity movements. With the Reserve Bank injecting durable liquidity through OMOs and US$/INR buy/sell swap auction, net LAF positions mirrored movements in government cash balances (Chart IV.27). The temporary mismatches between receipts and payments of the government during H1:2019-20 were partly met through recourse to cash management bills (CMBs) on two occasions of maturity ranging 10-33 days aggregating \u20b950,000 crore. Fine-tuning operations rate auctions continued to be the key feature of liquidity management during H1:2019-20. Liquidity injections were made through repo auctions of maturities ranging from overnight to 14 days, while reverse repos ranging from overnight to 7 days were frequently used for absorbing liquidity (Table IV.6). During H1, the WACR \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 generally traded below the repo rate during May-September (Chart IV.28). The objective of monetary policy is to keep the WACR aligned to the policy repo rate and contain volatility caused by exogeneous shocks within the interest rate corridor defined by the lower (reverse repo rate) and the upper (marginal standing facility rate) bounds. There are, however, instances when the WACR breached the corridor on account of: (i) uncertainty about liquidity conditions; (ii) market microstructure issues such as quarter-end or year-end liquidity tightness (due to advance tax payments or window dressing of balance sheet); (iii) structural changes in the monetary policy implementation framework (for instance, making the policy corridor non-symmetric by raising the MSF rate 300 bps above the policy repo rate in the aftermath of the taper tantrum episode); and (iv) banks\u2019 expectations of future interest rates. In this context, an empirical exercise identifies the factors contributing to the occurrence of such episodes (Box IV.1). Determinants of the spread (WACR over the policy repo rate) include market expectations, risk measures, liquidity conditions, and market microstructure variables (Table IV.1.1). Liquidity conditions have been defined as the net LAF position on any day as a proportion of the average Measured by Lagged spread First lag of spread (where spread is defined as weighted average call money market rate minus repo rate) 14 day Mumbai Inter-Bank Outright Rate (MIBOR) rate minus repo rate Corridor width as a dummy variable \u2013 it takes the value of 1 (if corridor width \u2264 100 bps) or 0 (if corridor width > 100 bps) 6 The expected impact is in terms of the increase (decrease) in the odds ratio. The odds ratio is defined as p/(1-p), where p is the probability of the WACR breaching the policy corridor. daily CRR requirement. An increase (decline) in this ratio would signify tightening (easing) of liquidity conditions leading to an increase (reduction) in the spread under deficit liquidity conditions. Skewed distribution of central bank\u2019s liquidity among banks may impact the WACR spread adversely, i.e., greater heterogeneity in distribution of liquidity (a few participants cornering a large part of central bank liquidity) is likely to increase the demand for funds in the call money market and increase the spread (Linzert and Schmidt, 2008; Kumar et al, 2017). This variable has been approximated by the share of call market transactions in the total overnight market volume. where p indicates the probability of the call money rate breaching the interest rate corridor. L is the logit function and Xs refers to the independent variables. The model is estimated based on daily data from May 2011 to June 2019 covering 1960 observations (Table IV.1.2). The results suggest that an increase in skewness of liquidity distribution will increase the odds of the call rate breaching the interest rate corridor. Similarly, an increase in liquidity conditions (more injection by the RBI relative to the CRR requirement of banks) and an increase in interest rate uncertainty also increases the odds of the call rate lying outside the interest rate corridor. In addition to the above, two dummies are also used for the empirical exercise keeping in view the idiosyncratic factors witnessed during the sample period. First, a dummy for changes in the liquidity management implementation framework is introduced for the period when the MSF rate was raised by 300 bps above the repo rate, as part of the policy response to domestic financial market turmoil in the aftermath of the taper tantrum. Accordingly, a value of 1 is taken for each day from July 17 to October 28, 2013 representing the post taper tantrum period and 0 otherwise. Second, a value of 1 for the period November 9, 2016 to January 31, 2017 and 0 otherwise is considered for the post-demonetisation period when the return of currency to the banking system resulted in large surplus liquidity with the WACR breaching the lower bound of the corridor, i.e., dropping below the reverse repo rate. Lagged spread Following an empirical strategy used in the literature on regime shifts in capital flows (Forbes and Warnock, 2012), a logistic regression analysis (binary logit model) was undertaken to estimate the probability of the call rate breaching the interest rate corridor (Prabu and Bhattacharyya, 2019). McFadden\u2019s R2 The following logit model was used: Note : p-values are in parentheses. The quarterly dummy indicates that the odds of having the call rate lying beyond the corridor at quarter-end ceteris paribus are 3.25 times as large as the odds on non-quarter-end days. In a similar fashion, the post taper tantrum dummy indicates that the odds of having the call rate breaching the interest rate corridor on days of turmoil post taper tantrum were 5.1 times as large as against those days not affected by financial market turbulence. Finally, the corridor width dummy (corridor width \u2264 100 basis point is 1, 0 otherwise) indicates that the odds of the call rate exceeding the interest rate corridor when the corridor width is lower than 100 bps is 4.39 times as large as the odds when the corridor width is higher than 100 bps. uncertainty about interest rates and foster stability by anchoring market expectations. Finally, liquidity forecasting needs to be prescient, particulary in a narrow interest rate corridor regime, as large forecast errors enhance the probability of the call rate breaching the interest rate corridor in either direction. From a policy perspective, the empirical exercise provides useful insights for the liquidity management operations of the central bank. As the findings suggest, skewness in liquidity distribution may cause the WACR to deviate from the corridor; hence liquidity management operations and practices should endeavour to reduce liquidity concentration among a few market players. Similarly, forward guidance through better communication on the evolving liquidity conditions can reduce market The WACR remained 6 bps above the policy repo rate rate by an identical margin in May. In June, however, it remained closely aligned with the policy repo rate (Chart IV.29). Subsequently, the WACR traded below WACR traded below the policy repo rate by 5 bps in H1:2019-20 as compared with 6 bps in H2:2018-19. Domestic financial markets remained vulnerable to turned risk averse reacting to global developments turned volatile in August, exerting depreciation pressures on currencies. By contrast, the bond market rallied significantly, despite some correction in the recent period. Credit growth, however, has slowed down, reflecting subdued economic prospects. Going forward, liquidity conditions would be managed consistent with the stated policy objective of aligning the WACR with the policy repo rate and ensuring that durable liquidity needs of the economy are adequately met, consistent with the stance of monetary policy. Ensuring faster monetary transmission to banks\u2019 lending rates remains a key priority. Global economic activity has remained sluggish as major advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) slowed down in Q2:2019. Mounting trade and geo-political uncertainties continue to cloud the near-term outlook. Monetary policy has been easing across the world to support growth concerns as inflation remains benign. Financial markets remained volatile on still unfolding sequence of US tariff actions and lingering uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Since the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of April 2019, global economic activity has weakened and the near-term outlook remains clouded by trade and geo-political uncertainties. Most major AEs and EMEs slowed down in Q2:2019. Crude oil prices remained volatile on shifting demand-supply balances, most recently caused by supply disruptions in Saudi Arabia \u2013 the second largest oil exporter \u2013 estimated to be of the order of around 5 per cent of global oil supply. Other global commodity prices remained soft on subdued global demand. Central banks across the world eased monetary policy to support growth concerns as inflation remains benign. The calm that characterised global financial markets in the beginning of 2019 has been dispelled since May, with a combination of trade and geo-political tensions and the worsening global growth outlook imparting heightened volatility. in rising retail sales, is expected to moderate the pace of slowdown to some extent. Euro area GDP growth slowed down in Q2:2019 as its major constituent economies lost steam amidst lingering uncertainties around Brexit and trade tensions. The German economy contracted in Q2 with a struggling auto industry amidst falling exports; it entered Q3 on a weak note as the manufacturing PMI in September remained in contraction zone, marking Economic activity has been losing pace across major AEs and EMEs. In the US, real GDP growth (q-o-q, annualised) decelerated in Q2:2019 to 2.0 per cent, after rebounding in Q1, on slumping exports and weak business fixed investment (Table V.1). Incoming data suggest that the slowdown may continue in Q3, as industrial production remains subdued and exports continue to decline. The Institute of Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index declined further into the contraction zone in September marking its lowest reading in a decade. Nonetheless, strong consumer spending, as reflected the ninth consecutive month of decline in factory activity. GDP growth in Italy stagnated in Q2 as contraction in industry and agriculture activities was offset by an uptick in the services sector, though its high level of debt and ongoing political uncertainty are downside risks. activity showed a slight uptick in Q2, incoming data showed signs of weakness for Q3 as consumer sentiment industrial remained subdued, with production and retail sales weakening since July. Nonetheless, higher fiscal spending for national development projects may support aggregate demand, going ahead. The Japanese economy grew at a slower pace in Q2 than in the preceding quarter as escalating US- China trade tensions and slackening global demand prompted a sharp downward revision in business spending. Combined with a scheduled sales tax hike, this has clouded the economic outlook for the rest of 2019. Nonetheless, fiscal stimulus and rushed purchases ahead of the sales tax hike are expected to support the economy in Q3. Real GDP in the UK contracted in Q2 on the back of declining manufacturing activity due to planned early shutdowns of car plants in April following Brexit uncertainty. Risks from a potential hard Brexit deal and evolving global trading conditions cloud the near-term outlook. The economies of Brazil and South Africa rebounded in Q2, after witnessing a sluggish start to the year. Economic recovery in Brazil was largely supported by strong fixed investment and construction activity in Q2. While improved sentiment amidst accommodative monetary policy is expected to sustain the expansion, risks from both domestic and external challenges may contain the momentum. In South Africa, economic activity accelerated on robust growth in mining and manufacturing, thus recouping output losses witnessed in Q1. The consumption- led economic recovery, however, is expected to be gradual as the uncertain global outlook and debt- ridden domestic power utilities may continue to weigh on the overall prospects of the economy. Economic activity remained subdued in key EMEs, held down by weakening global economic conditions. The Chinese economy decelerated in Q2 (y-o-y) to its weakest pace in nearly 27 years, weighed down by the adverse impact of the prolonged and unresolved trade dispute with the US, and subdued global demand. Available high frequency indicators suggest that the downtrend may continue, going forward. Industrial production and retail sales have declined since July, while the manufacturing PMI remains subdued amidst weak demand. While the overall risk remains titled to the downside on rising internal and external headwinds, policy stimuli on both the fiscal and monetary fronts are expected to cushion the pace of the slowdown. The Indonesian economy slowed down to 5.1 per cent (y-o-y) in each of the first two quarters of 2019, pulled down by subdued investment and declining exports, amidst global uncertainty. In Thailand, the downturn that had started in Q1 continued in Q2 (y-o-y), marking the slowest growth in nearly five years. The struggling farm sector, slowing exports and the weakening tourism sector resulted in the slowdown. The Turkish economy registered positive growth in the first half of 2019, recovering from last year\u2019s recession caused by a currency crisis. The recovery was underpinned by the stimulus provided in Q1 through high government spending and credit expansion. Among other BRICS economies, the Russian economy is struggling to regain momentum after undergoing in Q1. While economic a sharp deceleration The global composite PMI fell in August, after registering a marginal uptick in July, as slowing global trade weighed down on overall export growth (Chart V.1a). Among the major OECD economies, composite leading indicators (CLIs) point to a slowdown in growth momentum across major AEs and EMEs (Chart V.1b). the Baltic Dry Index also remained sluggish, though The slowdown in global trade, which began in the later half of 2018, has continued in 2019, with contribution from EMEs slipping into contraction in 2019 (Chart V.2a). Forward looking indicators suggest that world trade is likely to slow down further in 2019. The WTO\u2019s Goods Trade Barometer1 remains below trend, driven by sluggish performance in all its constituent indices, especially international Global commodity prices weakened as trade tensions intensified. The Bloomberg commodity price index declined by 4.1 per cent between April and September Organisation (FAO) increased by 1.4 per cent during April-September 2019. Global food prices rose for the fifth consecutive month in May, driven by high dairy and maize prices resulting from tighter export supplies. They, however, slid marginally in June-July as dairy prices fell on weak demand. Global food prices moderated further in August due to a sharp decline in cereals and sugar prices. While cereal prices fell on ample export supplies, weakening Brazilian currency and prospects of larger shipments by India and Mexico kept sugar prices low (Chart V.3a). Movements in global food prices have implications for food price inflation in EMEs (Box V.1). iron ore and nickel by major exporters and have been trading side-ways thereafter, as the market awaits further developments on the trade front. Copper prices fell sharply on waning demand, triggered by trade uncertainties, with intermittent increases in June on a mine strike in Chile and weak Chinese refined copper output. Gold prices remained elevated on safe haven demand as global uncertainties increased (Chart V.4). Inflation remained benign in major AEs and EMEs. Among AEs, CPI inflation in the US remained tepid despite tight labour markets, as the sensitivity The stand-off between the US and Iran and agreement by key oil producers to extend supply cuts further by nine months exerted upward pressures on oil prices in early May. However, a decline in the expected demand for oil amidst adequate supplies eased market tightness and weighed on prices, before witnessing the biggest one-day gain on September 16, 2019, caused by supply disruptions to the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia. However, it eased thereafter on expectations of supply restoration (Chart V.3b). Base metal prices, measured by the Bloomberg base metal spot index, declined by 9.0 per cent between April and September 2019 on increased pessimism over the growth outlook and slowing global demand on persistent trade tensions. However, they recovered marginally in July on elevated supply concerns about International food prices have been among the most significant sources of domestic food price variations in many EMEs, as the share of food in household expenditure is relatively high in these countries. The World Bank\u2019s food price index increased by 23.8 per cent in 2007, 33.5 per cent in 2008 and by 22.5 per cent in 2011, with unexpected spikes seen across all food groups. Although the magnitude of price increases in these episodes was almost the same, the affected commodities were different (Chart V.1.1). While rice, wheat, oil and cereal prices remained high during 2007-08, sugar prices remained low. Rice prices were the highest during the first episode but were lower than many other cereal products during the second episode. According (LOP) (Ardeni, 1989; Barahona and Chulaphan, 2017), in efficient markets for a single homogenous transport costs or commodity, assuming no obstacles to trade, prices expressed in a common currency are equated according to the following equation: where ER is the exchange rate [unit(s) of domestic currency per unit of foreign currency], Pw is the world (foreign) food price and Pd is the domestic food price. The estimable version of equation (1) can be modified as a weak LOP hypothesis which in natural logarithm form is as below: Pw is implicitly assumed to be an exogenous variable, as EMEs are generally price takers and \u03b2 is the long-term price transmission elasticity in the presence of a long-run relationship. The short-term price elasticity can be estimated from the error correction model (ECM) of the following form: Note: ***, ** and * denote 1 per cent, 5 per cent and 10 per cent level of significance, respectively. Source: RBI staff estimates. Where \u0394 is the first difference operator, ECT is the error correction term, \u03c6 and \u03b3 are the short-term transmission elasticities and \u03c1 is the persistence parameter. Against this backdrop, the pass-through of changes in world food prices to domestic food prices was examined for six EMEs, viz., Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Turkey as these countries have a high share of food items in their consumer price indices (Sahoo et al., 2019). Using monthly data from January 2007 to July 2019, it was found that each of the variables, viz., global food price index, country-specific food price indices and exchange rates are integrated of order one, i.e., I(1). Therefore, the existence of a cointegrating relationship was examined through vector error correction model (VECM). The lag length of each model was based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). The estimated VECM model for each country confirms that residuals are not serially correlated. The estimated short-run and long-run transmission elasticities reveal that the magnitude of price transmission from world food prices to domestic food prices differs across countries (Table V.1.1). All the transmission elasticities are positive and different from zero and short-run elasticities are lower than the long-run elasticities, barring for Turkey and India. The short-run price transmission elasticity for food price in India is 0.05, implying that if world food price increases by one per cent, food CPI in India could increase by five basis points. To summarise, volatile food prices pose a significant policy challenge across the world and have implications for domestic inflation in EMEs, especially those having high share of food imports. resource utilisation of remains low. However, it registered a modest uptick in July on recovering energy prices. While core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) \u2013 the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation \u2013 has been picking up since June, it remains below the US Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target. In the Euro area, inflationary pressures have been easing on soft energy costs and weakening growth. In Japan, CPI inflation remained muted amidst falling food, transport and communication prices (Chart V.5a). Inflation has been easing in many EMEs. In Russia, inflation edged lower since Q2 as consumer demand remained weak, while easing supplies on a strong harvest and appreciating ruble have added to disinflationary conditions. In Brazil, CPI inflation has been falling since April on the back of soft food and fuel prices; however, it picked up marginally in August on rising housing and transport prices. In South Africa, inflation eased in July, after remaining steady in Q2 on falling fuel prices. In August, however, it edged up on rising food and housing prices. Inflation in Turkey, which has been ebbing since April, registered a sharp drop in June, driven by a favourable base effect and softening of food prices. In July, however, it showed a slight uptick on high service prices resulting from increased municipal tariffs, before resuming its downward path in August (Chart V.5b). Monetary policy has become accommodative across major AEs and EMEs. The US Fed has reduced its policy rate twice since July 2019 on concerns over lingering trade uncertainties and muted inflationary pressures (Chart V.6a). The European Central Bank (ECB) reduced the interest rate on deposit facility deeper into negative territory, while approving a fresh round of monetary stimulus in the form of bond purchases of 20 billion euros per month, beginning from November 2019. Ebbing inflation, waning business confidence and fears of Germany sliding into recession prompted the ECB to unveil another round of quantitative easing. The ECB has also indicated that rates will remain at present or lower levels until the inflation outlook converges to a level sufficiently close but below 2 per cent within its projection horizon. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) continued with its ultra-loose monetary policy on mounting downside risks to the economy and signalled a ramping up of stimulus if growth momentum loses further. The UK and Canada kept their policy rates unchanged, while South Korea kept its policy rate unchanged in August, after reducing it by 25 bps in its July meeting on concerns over slowing growth. Central banks in EMEs have turned increasingly dovish in sync with their AE counterparts on easing inflation conditions and weakening economic outlook. Among the BRICS, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) continued with its loose monetary policy stance, while indicating potential policy adjustments, going forward, as the domestic situation warrants. Moreover, with the aim of stimulating the economy via ample liquidity conditions, the PBOC provided liquidity support to small and medium sized banks by increasing rediscount quota and standing lending facility to RMB 200 billion and RMB 100 billion, respectively, in June. In order to support the development of the real economy and lower financing costs, the PBOC lowered the required reserve ratio for financial institutions by 50 bps in September 2019 (excluding finance companies, financial leasing companies and auto finance companies). In an effort to increase the support for micro and small businesses, it has also decided to lower the required reserve ratio by 50 bps each on October 15 and November 15, 2019 for rural commercial banks operating solely within provincial administrative regions. Furthermore, it reduced its loan prime rate for one year maturity by 5 bps in its September meeting. Brazil cut its policy rate twice since July, attributing it to moderating inflationary pressures and weakening economic activity. Russia reduced its policy rate thrice in 2019 on falling inflation and weak demand. South Africa held its policy rate in September, while reducing it in July amidst ebbing inflation expectations. Among other EMEs, Turkey slashed its policy rate by 425 bps and 325 bps in July and September, respectively, exceeding market expectations, as the improving inflation outlook provided more space for policy easing. The Philippines reduced its policy rate for the third time in 2019 in its September meeting with a view to reviving business investment and supporting slowing economy. Mexico reduced its policy rate in September, making it the second consecutive cut since August. Chile has reduced its policy rate twice since June. Indonesia reduced its policy rate by 25 bps in its September meeting, making it the third consecutive cut in Q3:2019, for boosting economic growth amidst low inflation (Chart V.6b). Financial markets remained volatile as sentiment was repeatedly impacted by the still unfolding sequence of US tariff actions and lingering uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Global equity markets witnessed sharp sell- offs in May reversing the gains till April. However, markets recouped most of the losses in June-July as sentiment was buoyed by dovish guidance by major central banks and renewed hopes of trade truce, before declining again in August as unresolved and intensifying trade dispute triggered bearish sentiment. In September, positive signals on trade negotiations buoyed investors\u2019 risk appetite. Bond yields eased across major economies on safe haven demand, while currency markets remained volatile. Among AEs, US equities gained in June-July, after correcting in May, driven by resilient corporate earnings data for Q1:2019 and rising expectations of monetary policy easing by the Fed in the coming months. In August, while increasing risk-off sentiment amidst intensifying trade tensions and growth worries led to large sell-offs, positive developments on the trade front revived market sentiment in September, as a result of which equity markets recovered most of its losses suffered in August. In the Euro area, equity markets tumbled in May in response to weak German data. However, they remained supported in June-July on expectations of monetary policy accommodation by the ECB and positive developments in earning corporations. expectations Nonetheless, markets ended August on a soft note as growth worries resurfaced on weak German data and political turmoil in Italy. Japanese equity markets also firmed up in June-July after correcting in May. Markets maintained an uptrend in July as trade concerns receded, though they plunged in the middle of the month on appreciation of the Yen and concerns over deteriorating performance of some export- oriented companies. Equity markets in AEs entered September on a positive note as global investors\u2019 sentiment was lifted on reduced tensions in Hong Kong and renewed hopes of trade negotiations. Stock markets in EMEs fell as the strong US dollar acted as a headwind leading to capital outflows. Weak South Korean equities following trade conflicts with Japan, political unrest in Hong Kong, crash in Argentina\u2019s financial markets and escalating trade tensions pulled down EME stocks further in August. However, some of the losses were recovered subsequently as market sentiments were boosted by postponement of tariff imposition and signals of stimulus for the Chinese economy (Chart V.7). Bond yields have eased across major AEs and EMEs as investors looked for safe havens on waning risk appetite. US bond yields softened in May, after picking up in April on better GDP data for Q1. They have declined sharply since then, even falling below 2 per cent in August amidst heightened trade tensions and dovish stance of the US Fed. A sharp fall in long-term yields has led to a negative yield spread between 10-year and 3-month Treasury securities, as addressed in Box I.1 in chapter I. In the Euro area, bond yields plunged into negative territory in most of its constituent economies as expectations of dovish monetary policy stance by the ECB gained traction, amidst a weakening economic outlook. Lacklustre data for Germany and political uncertainties Italy added further downward pressure. In Japan, bond yields continued to trade in negative territory on subdued risk appetite. In most EMEs, bond yields have been falling, with central banks becoming highly accommodative as benign inflation has freed up policy space to boost slackening economic growth (Chart V.8a). In currency markets, the US dollar weakened against major currencies in June on dovish guidance by the US Fed but it has rebounded since July, recouping most of its losses made in Q1. Safe haven demand in other AEs amidst weaker growth prospects also strengthened the US dollar. The euro lost ground against the US dollar as the economy lost momentum, while higher probability of the ECB to stimulate the economy pulled the currency further down. The Japanese yen outperformed most of the major currencies as trade war induced uncertainties, coupled with worsening global growth conditions, played up investors\u2019 risk-off sentiments. Most of the EME currencies suffered losses against the strong US dollar and mounting spillover risks arising from trade tensions. Between April and September 2019, the MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index declined by 2.0 per cent (Chart V.8b). In sum, global economic activity continues to lose momentum as prolonged uncertainties relating to geo-political developments dampened economic sentiment. With inflationary pressures remaining benign and market sentiment remaining fragile, risks to the global outlook remain on the downside. However, monetary and fiscal stimuli across the globe may help in containing the pace of slowdown and putting the global economy on a recovery path.

Box III.3: Augmenting Quarterly Projection Model (QPM): Fiscal Block The global macroeconomic outlook is overcast with the COVID-19 pandemic, with massive dislocations in global production, supply chains, trade and tourism. Financial markets across the world are experiencing extreme volatility; global commodity prices, especially of crude oil, have declined sharply. COVID-19 would impact economic activity in India directly due to lockdowns, and through second round effects operating through global trade and growth. The impact of COVID-19 on inflation is ambiguous, with a possible decline in food prices likely to be offset by potential cost-push increases in prices of non-food items due to supply disruptions. As this Monetary Policy Report (MPR) goes for release, the global macroeconomic outlook is overcast with the COVID-19 pandemic. With over 12 lakh confirmed infections and over 67,000 deaths across 211 countries as of April 7, 2020 and counting, the sheer scale and speed of the unfolding human tragedy is overwhelming. The disruption of economic activity in a wide swathe of affected countries is set to intensify in the face of headwinds in the form of massive dislocations in global production, supply chains, trade and tourism. Global output is now seen as contracting in 2020. Financial markets across the world are experiencing extreme volatility: equity markets recorded sharp sell-offs, with volatility touching levels seen during the global financial crisis; flights to safety have taken down sovereign bond yields to record lows; risk spreads have widened; and financial conditions have tightened. Global commodity prices, especially of crude oil, have also declined sharply in anticipation of weakening global demand on the one hand, and the failed negotiations of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, on the other. G20 finance ministers and central bank governors have committed to use all available policy tools to deal with COVID-19. G20 Leaders have resolved to do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic. The International making available US$ 50 billion and US$ 14 billion, their membership to help them respond to the crisis. Turning to the domestic economy, India has not been spared from the exponential spread of COVID-19 and by April 7, more than 4,700 cases had been reported. While efforts are being mounted on a war footing to arrest its spread, COVID-19 would impact economic Second round effects would operate through a immediately, spillovers are being transmitted through inevitably accentuate the growth slowdown, which started in Q1:2018-19 and continued through H2:2019- Many central banks have eased monetary, liquidity and regulatory policies to support domestic demand, including through emergency off-cycle meetings. Bilateral swap lines between some central banks that were deployed during the global financial crisis have been activated. G7 finance ministers and central bank governors have stated that they stand ready to cooperate further on timely and effective measures. during December 2019-February 2020, led by a spike in vegetable prices. While it has peaked and vegetable prices are on the ebb, the impact of COVID-19 on inflation is ambiguous relative to that on growth, with a possible decline in prices of food items being offset items due to supply disruptions. During October 2019-March 2020, the monetary policy committee (MPC) met four times. The meeting scheduled for March 31, April 1 and 3, 2020 was advanced to March 24, 26 and 27, 2020. In its October 2019 meeting, the MPC had noted that the continuing slowdown warranted intensified efforts to restore the growth momentum. With inflation expected to remain below target in the remaining period of 2019-20 and Q1:2020-21, the MPC took the view that policy space could be used to address growth concerns within the flexible inflation targeting mandate. Accordingly, it voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 5.15 per cent (5 members voted for a reduction of 25 bps and one member voted for a reduction of 40 bps), and committed to continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remained within the target. of 75 bps and 2 members voted for a reduction of 50 bps). During February-March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also undertook several measures to further improve liquidity, monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy, and provide relief on debt servicing (Chapter IV). The MPC\u2019s voting pattern reflects the differences in individual members\u2019 assessments, expectations and policy preferences, as also reflected in MPCs in other central banks (Table I.1). analyse macroeconomic Chapters developments during October 2019-March 2020 and explain the deviations of inflation and growth outcomes from projections. Turning to the outlook, the evolution of key macroeconomic and financial variables over the past six months warrants revisions in the baseline assumptions (Table I.2). The MPC decided to hold the policy rate unchanged in its December 2019 and February 2020 meetings. While domestic demand conditions weakened further in the run-up to these meetings, inflation rose sharply and breached the upper tolerance level of the mandated inflation band in November and December 2019. Given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the MPC felt it appropriate to maintain status quo, although it voted to persevere with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, given the space available for future policy action. First, international crude oil prices (Indian basket) have fluctuated in a wide range since the October 2019 MPR. These prices initially increased during late December 2019 and early January 2020 to around In its off-cycle meeting in March, the MPC noted that macroeconomic risks brought on by the pandemic could be severe, both on the demand and supply sides, and stressed upon the need to do whatever is necessary to shield the domestic economy from the pandemic. The MPC reduced the policy repo rate by 75 bps to 4.4 per cent (4 members voted for a reduction early March in anticipation of lower global demand following the outbreak of COVID-19 and its rapid geographical spread. Brent prices crashed to US$ 32 on March 9, 2020 following Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to cut prices and increase production over the failure to reach an agreement with Russia on production cuts. Brent fell further to US$ 23 on March 30, 2020 while US crude prices dipped briefly below US$ 20. Brent rebounded to US$ 34 per barrel on April 3. Given the current demand-supply assessment, the baseline scenario assumes crude oil prices (Indian basket) to average around US$ 35 per barrel during 2020-21 (Chart I.1). Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. Second, the nominal exchange rate (the Indian rupee or INR vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar) exhibited sizable two-way movements during October-December 2019. The INR came under intensified and sustained depreciation pressures beginning mid-January, reflecting a generalised weakening of emerging market currencies amidst flights to safety. Accordingly, the baseline assumes an average of INR 75 per US dollar to reflect these recent developments. taken together. Sources: RBI estimates; Budget documents; and IMF. US$ 70 per barrel, triggered by US-Iran tensions. They subsequently softened, however, to reach US$ 51 by Third, even though uncertainties relating to US- China trade relations and Brexit have receded, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken over. This has cast a shadow on the macroeconomic outlook, with global supply chains, trade, tourism, and the hotel industry being severely affected. The World Trade Organisation\u2019s (WTO) goods and services trade barometers indicate that world trade volume growth weakened in early 2020; it is expected to be debilitated further by the adverse impact of COVID-19. The IMF expects that the contraction in global output in 2020 could be as bad as or worse than in 2009. The depth of the recession and the pace of recovery in 2021 would depend on the speed of containment of the pandemic and the efficacy of monetary and fiscal policy actions by various countries. The slowdown could be more protracted in dire scenarios in which the duration of COVID-19 extends longer. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates suggest that annual global gross domestic product (GDP) growth could be lower by up to 2 percentage points for each month in which strict containment measures continue. If the shutdown continues for three months with no offsetting factors, annual GDP growth could be between 4-6 percentage points lower than it otherwise might have been. Headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation breached the upper tolerance band of the target in December 2019 and peaked in January 2020, before ebbing prices of vegetables, fruits and petroleum products produced a downward shift of 100 bps in February. The trajectory of inflation in the near-term is likely to be conditioned by the pace of reversal of the spike in vegetables prices, the dispersion of inflationary pressures across other food prices, the incidence of one-off cost-push effects on various elements of core inflation and especially, the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak. Looking ahead, three months and one year ahead median inflation expectations of urban households softened by 10 bps and 20 bps, respectively, in the March 2020 round of the survey conducted by the RBI1. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate also decreased for both three months and one year ahead horizons vis-\u00e0-vis the January 2020 round (Chart I.2). Although largely adaptive, inflation expectations of households and firms can shape future inflation through price and wage setting behaviour. According the Reserve Bank\u2019s to consumer confidence survey for March 2020, inflation expectations moderated over the previous round2. Manufacturing firms polled in the January-March 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expected an increase in selling prices as well as in the cost of raw materials in Q1:2020-21; nonetheless, pricing power of firms is expected to remain weak 1 The Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households is conducted in 18 cities and the results of the March 2020 survey undertaken during February 27\u2013 March 7, 2020 are based on responses from 5,912 households. 2 The Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey is conducted in 13 major cities and the results of the March 2020 round undertaken during February 27-March 7, 2020 are based on responses from 5,365 respondents. Note: Net response is the difference between the respondents reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism. The range is -100 to 100. An increase/decrease in net responses in respect of the selling price is optimistic/ pessimistic, while the increase/decrease in net response in respect of the cost of raw materials is pessimistic/optimistic from the view point of respondent firms. Therefore, higher negative values for the cost of raw materials indicate higher input price pressures and vice versa. Source: Industrial Outlook Survey, RBI. I.3)3. Purchasing managers\u2019 surveys (Chart for manufacturing and services reported moderation in the rate of increase in input and output prices for March 2020. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in March 2020 expected CPI inflation to ease from 6.6 per cent in February 2020 to 5.3 per cent in Q1:2020- 21 and 3.2 per cent by Q4:2020-21 (Chart I.4) 4. Thus, an array of forward-looking indicators is pointing to a much softer inflation trajectory. Looking ahead, the balance of inflation risks is slanted even further to the downside. First, food prices may soften under the beneficial effects of the record foodgrains and horticulture production, at least till the onset of the usual summer uptick. Second, the collapse in crude prices should work towards easing inflationary pressures, depending on the level of the pass-through to retail prices. All these signals are, however, heavily conditioned by the depth, spread and duration of COVID-19 and shifts in any of these characteristics of the pandemic can produce drastic changes in the outlook. In these conditions, forecasts are hazardous as they are subject to large revisions with every incoming data on the pandemic. The RBI Act, however, enjoins the Reserve Bank to publish and explain in the MPR, inter alia, the forecasts of inflation for 6-18 months from the date of its publication. Therefore, taking into account initial conditions, signals from forward- looking surveys and estimates from time series and structural models, CPI inflation is tentatively projected to ease from 4.8 per cent in Q1:2020-21 to 4.4 per cent in Q2, 2.7 per cent in Q3 and 2.4 per cent in Q4, with the caveat that in the prevailing high uncertainty, aggregate demand may weaken further than currently anticipated and ease core inflation further, while supply bottlenecks could exacerbate pressures more than expected. Per contra, a quick containment of COVID-19 could lead to faster recovery and, therefore, firmer inflation pressures. Given the lockdown, the 3 The results of the January-March 2020 round of the industrial outlook survey (launched on January 30, 2020) are based on 860 responses received till March 18, 2020. 4 25 panellists participated in the March 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of professional forecasters, conducted during March 6-19, 2020. compilation of the CPI for March and the following few months by the National Statistical Office could also become challenging. For 2021-22, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation could move in a range of 3.6-3.8 per cent. Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, the outlook for growth for 2020-21 was looking up. First, the bumper rabi harvest and higher food prices during 2019-20 provided conducive conditions for the strengthening of rural demand. Second, the transmission of past reductions in the policy rate to bank lending rates has been improving, with favourable implications for both consumption and investment demand. Third, reductions in the goods and services tax (GST) rates, corporate tax rate cuts in September 2019 and measures to boost rural and infrastructure spending were directed at boosting domestic demand more generally. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered this outlook. The global economy is expected to slump into recession in 2020, as post-COVID projections indicate. The sharp reduction in international crude oil prices, if sustained, could improve the country\u2019s terms of trade, but the gain from this channel is not expected to offset the drag from the shutdown and loss of external demand. of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, reflecting expectations of higher production, order books, capacity utilisation, employment conditions, exports and overall business situation (Chart I.6). In view of the intensification of COVID-19, a quick survey with select parameters was specially conducted during March 18-20 to capture business sentiments. From the Turning to key messages from forward-looking surveys, the March 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey showed that consumer confidence for the year ahead was expected to remain around its level recorded in the previous survey round in January 2020 (Chart I.5). However, an important caveat to the forward-looking surveys presented in this section is that they were completed before the nation-wide lockdown effective March 25. Optimism in the manufacturing sector for the quarter ahead had improved in the January-March 2020 round limited responses received, a considerable worsening of the key demand indicators is seen in the outlook for Q1:2020-21. Surveys by other agencies (conducted prior to the intensification of COVID-19) indicated optimism on future business expectations (Table I.3). According to the purchasing managers\u2019 surveys for March 2020, one year ahead business expectations of firms in manufacturing slumped to its weakest level, driven by fears of prolonged disruption from COVID-19. Business expectations of firms in the services sector also fell. Professional forecasters polled in the March 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey (conducted during March 6-19 before the announcement of the nation- wide lockdown) expected real GDP growth to recover from 4.6 per cent in Q4:2019-20 to 6.1 per cent in Q4:2020-21 (Chart I.7 and Table I.4). Overall, apart from the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities, other sectors of the economy will be adversely impacted by the pandemic, depending upon its intensity, spread and duration. Relatively modest upsides are expected to emanate from monetary, fiscal and other policy measures and the early containment of COVID-19, if that occurs. Such uncertainties make the forecasting of inflation and growth highly challenging (Box I.1). Credit growth of scheduled commercial banks Combined gross fiscal deficit (per cent of GDP) Notes: 1.

Note: GNDI: Gross National Disposable Income. Source: Survey of Professional Forecasters (March 2020 round, conducted during March 6-19, 2020). Monetary policy actions impact output and inflation with long and variable lags. Hence, timely and reliable forecasts of output and inflation are of critical importance. Domestic and global shocks to key conditioning variables such as global crude oil prices, global trade and growth, the exchange rate, the monsoon outturn and the rising frequency of their visitations make forecasting a challenging task, however, especially around the turning points. In an analysis of inflation and GDP growth forecasts of 17 select central banks for 2018 and 2019, most of them, including the RBI, were initially optimistic about economic activity (i.e., negative forecast errors)5. The standardised forecast errors (i.e., errors divided by the actual growth rate/inflation) were comparable (Chart I.1.1). Note: Forecast Error (Standardised) is forecast error as percentage of actual GDP growth/inflation of the country. *: 15.4 percentage points in 2018 and (-) 4.9 percentage points in 2019; #: (-)1145 per cent in 2019. Sources: Respective central banks\u2019 websites; and RBI staff estimates. 5 Apart from the RBI, the analysis covers the central banks of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey, UK, US and Euro area. For Romania and Turkey, the analysis is restricted to inflation forecasts in the absence of information on GDP growth forecasts. The focus of the analysis is on one-year ahead forecast errors (actual outturn less the forecast); therefore, the forecasts for the years 2018 and 2019 made in the last quarter of 2017 and 2018, respectively, are considered. For the RBI, the forecasts for the financial years 2018-19 and 2019-20 available in the February 2018 and February 2019 policy statements, respectively, are taken. Panel regression results indicate that global growth surprises have been an important factor underlying domestic growth forecast errors; crude oil price surprises impact, although not significant have a negative (Equation 1). However, inflation forecast errors seem to be more due to country-specific idiosyncratic factors - domestic growth forecast errors as well as crude oil price surprises are not statistically significant (Equation 2). The constant term is statistically insignificant in both the regressions, suggesting that the forecast errors were unbiased, once the global growth and crude oil surprises were controlled for. Note: Mean absolute error is average of absolute forecast errors for the years 2018 and 2019. Sources: Websites of central banks/statistics offices and RBI staff estimates. Figures in parentheses are t-statistics; y_fe, \u03c0_fe, yw_s, doil are growth forecast errors, inflation forecast errors, global growth surprise and change in crude oil prices in local currency terms, respectively6. In India, the forecasting challenges are even more acute, given the high share (45.9 per cent) of the food basket in the CPI (Combined) (Chart I.1.2) as well as large revisions in past GDP growth rates. The Reserve Bank, like other central banks, provides fan charts around the baseline projections to convey future uncertainty. Against this backdrop and especially, the highly fluid circumstances in which incoming data produce shifts in the outlook for growth on a daily basis, forecasts for real GDP growth in India are not provided here, awaiting a clear fix on the intensity, spread and duration of COVID-19. To illustrate, in early March, the OECD projected the decline in global growth for 2020 in the range of 0.5-1.5 percentage points. More recently, with COVID-19 having spread to more than 200 countries, the IMF\u2019s latest assessment is that global growth during 2020 could be negative vis-\u00e0- vis growth of 2.9 per cent in 2019 (which itself was a decadal low). Thus, global growth could be lower by three percentage points or more in 2020 relative to 2019. The possible impact of the global slowdown on India\u2019s growth and inflation can be assessed by using the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM)7 under alternative scenarios. Scenario 1 assumes global growth in 2020 to be 3 percentage points lower than in 2019. Scenario 2 assumes that the outbreak is contained faster and the loss of global output growth is only 1.5 percentage points relative to 2019. Lower global output and demand can impact the Indian economy through a variety of channels. First, it can affect exports adversely, leading to lower domestic demand, growth and inflation. Second, international crude oil and other commodity prices have already softened sharply amidst high volatility and India, being a net importer, can benefit from the lower commodity prices. Finally, heightened 6 Global growth surprise is captured by actual global growth less the forecast made in the preceding year\u2019s October edition of the IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook. Crude oil price surprise is measured as the percentage change in its local-currency price during the year from its level in the last quarter of the preceding year. 7 The QPM is a semi-structural, forward-looking, open economy, calibrated, gap model in the New Keynesian tradition and provides an internally consistent analysis of various feedback mechanisms. global financial market volatility can feed into domestic financial markets and impact both growth and inflation. The QPM captures all these channels. The model\u2019s simulations suggest that, on account of global factors, domestic growth could be lower, at its peak, by 180 bps in Scenario 1 and by 80 bps in Scenario 2. Inflation could be lower by 40-100 bps at its peak under the two scenarios (Chart I.8). Global crude oil prices have declined sharply from global demand following the outbreak of COVID-19, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to cut prices. However, the short and medium-term outlook of oil remains highly The COVID-19 pandemic poses upside and downside risks to the baseline assumptions and outlook. containment of the COVID-19 or renewed geopolitical The exchange rate of the Indian rupee vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar has moved in both directions in recent months. Renewed bouts of global financial market volatility caused by the uncertainty of macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19, as in February-March 2020, could exert pressure on the Indian rupee. Should the INR depreciate by 5 per cent from the baseline, inflation could edge up by around 20 bps while GDP growth could be higher by around 15 bps through increased net exports. In contrast, should COVID-19 normalise quickly, strong capital flows could revive. An appreciation of the INR by 5 per cent could moderate inflation could be higher by 20 bps and growth could be weaker by around 15 bps. If COVID-19 were to for crude oil could fall further in an environment of sustained oversupply due to Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to could ease by up to 20 bps and growth higher by up to 15 bps, depending upon the extent of pass-through to After remaining subdued for a considerable period, food inflation in India increased sharply during October 2019-January 2020, driven by a spike in vegetable prices. The baseline path assumes vegetable prices to fall rapidly in response to arrivals of rabi harvests and a normal south-west monsoon during 2020, which is supported by early signals of likely ENSO (El Nino \u2013 Southern Oscillation) neutral conditions. Adequate buffer stocks in cereals and a good rabi harvest (2019 season) could soften food inflation more than anticipated and pull down headline inflation by 50 bps below the baseline. On the other hand, a deficient or spatially skewed south-west monsoon, and an unexpected hardening of prices of non-vegetable food items could push COVID-19, the accompanying lockdowns and the expected contraction in global output in 2020 weigh heavily on the growth outlook. The actual outturn would depend upon the speed with which the outbreak is contained and economic activity returns to normalcy. Significant monetary and liquidity measures taken by the Reserve Bank and fiscal measures by the government would mitigate the adverse impact on domestic demand and help spur economic activity once normalcy is restored. Risks around the inflation projections appear balanced at this juncture and the tentative outlook is benign relative to recent history. But COVID-19 hangs over the future, like a spectre. Consumer price inflation surged between October 2019 and January 2020 propelled by a vegetable price spike, particularly of onions and breached the upper tolerance threshold in December before moderating in February. Fuel prices emerged out of deflation in December. After touching a historic low in October, inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel edged up due to idiosyncratic cost-push factors. Costs of farm inputs, industrial raw materials, agricultural and non-agricultural labourers\u2019 nominal wages and organised sector staff costs remained muted. Headline inflation, measured by the consumer price index (CPI),1 had been trailing below target for ratcheting up of vegetables prices \u2013 mainly those of onions \u2013 dispelled this environment of price stability. In the event, headline inflation breached the upper and peaked at 7.6 per cent in January 2020 before moderating to 6.6 per cent in February. An unusually have been 4.5 per cent in Q3 and 5.9 per cent in Q4 (till February), underscoring the severity of the onion price shock. Fuel prices too moved out of five months of deflation into positive territory in December 2019 and increased sharply thereafter. Inflation excluding food and fuel \u2013 or core inflation \u2013 hardened in a sustained manner from a historic low of 3.4 per cent in October 2019 to 4.3 per cent in January 2020, propelled by a series of cost pushes before registering some moderation in February (Chart II.1). prolonged south-west monsoon and unseasonal rains ravaged the later part of the kharif harvest and produced an unprecedented rise in prices of onions. In fact, excluding onions, headline inflation would The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1934 (amended in 2016) enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections, if any, and 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year changes in all India CPI Combined (Rural and Urban). food and fuel inflation also turned out to be a source of projection errors in Q4 due to a series of cost-push shocks \u2013 higher mobile phone tariffs; higher motor- vehicles prices due to the ongoing switchover to BS-VI2 compliant vehicles, higher gold prices reflecting international price movements; and higher services prices for sweepers, laundry, beauticians, bus fares \u2013 reflecting, inter alia, the spill over from higher food and fuel prices. In Q4:2019-20 (January- February), crude oil prices (Indian basket) softened from around US$ 63 per barrel at the time of the October MPR to US$ 55 per barrel by February, which helped temper these cost-push upsides. explain the underlying reasons thereof. The Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of October 2019 had projected CPI inflation to remain range-bound in H2: 2019-20, at 3.5 per cent in Q3:2019-20 and at 3.7 per cent for Q4:2019-20. Actual inflation outcomes have overshot projections by a considerable margin \u2013 2.3 percentage points in Q3 and 3.4 percentage points in Q4 (Chart II.2). As stated earlier, the unanticipated and unparalleled spike in onion prices was the major source of deviation of headline inflation from projections. Unseasonal rains also delayed the seasonal winter moderation in prices of other vegetables, particularly those of potatoes. In addition, a larger than anticipated pick-up in cereals and milk prices due to kharif crop damage coming from the unseasonal rains, lower wheat imports and higher minimum support prices for wheat in the case of the former and an escalation in input costs in the case of the latter aggravated inflation pressures. CPI excluding A decomposition of year-on-year (y-o-y) inflation suggests that a sharp increase in price momentum as well as unfavourable base effects were at work in H2:2019-203. As against the normal seasonal decline in food prices during Q3, the measured food price momentum in Q3 was positive registering the highest increase during any third quarter in the history of the index. As a result, food inflation surged to double digits by the end of Q3. Adverse base effects also pushed up fuel inflation. In January, food prices started to decline, but the persisting firmness in the momentum of core inflation pushed headline inflation to a peak in January. In February, headline inflation moderated coming from a sharp decline in food prices and waning of core inflation momentum (Chart II.3). The distribution of inflation across CPI groups in 2019-20 has diverged considerably from the recent historical experience. Median inflation rate turned out to be lower compared with the last three-year average. However, 2019-20 exhibited high positive 2 BS VI or Bharat Stage VI denotes the new emission standard that needs to be complied by all light and heavy vehicles, two and three wheeled vehicles manufactured on or after April 1, 2020. 3 A change in CPI year-on-year (y-o-y) inflation between any two months is the difference between the current month-on-month (m-o-m) change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details see Box I.1 of the MPR, September 2014. d: CPI excluding Food and Fuel skew \u2013 as food sub-groups like vegetables exhibited very high inflation rates \u2013 compared to a negative skew for the historical average. As a result, the mean inflation rate for 2019-20 turned out to be considerably higher than the average of last 3 years (Chart II.4). Even as select food items swayed overall inflation rates in Q3:2019-20, a pick-up in the diffusion indices4 of price changes in CPI items, on a seasonally adjusted basis, also point to a broad- basing of price increases in the CPI basket \u2013 across goods and services \u2013 during this period. In Q4 so far, while almost all services have continued to register price increases, incidence of price increases in goods has seen some compression, largely on account of food items (Chart II.5). 4 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. A reading above 50 for the diffusion index signals a broad expansion or generalisation of price increases and a reading below 50 signals a broad-based price decline. pulses, sugar and petroleum products. Durable goods contribution to headline inflation, which remained largely steady during September-December \u2013 on an average at 36 bps \u2013 picked up to around 40 bps in January-February due to a rise in gold prices. Imported goods7 contributed negatively to overall inflation during September-November 2019, but their contribution turned positive during December 2019-February 2020 \u2013 on an average contributing around 60 bps to headline inflation, after a surge in energy and precious metals prices (Chart II.6c). The contribution of services to overall inflation remained sticky at around one percentage point as the sharp increase in mobile telecom charges during December 2019-January 2020 more than offset the moderation in inflation in house rentals, hospital services and tuition fees (Chart II.6b). A historical decomposition of inflation outcomes in H2:2019-20 reveals how adverse supply shocks overwhelmed the disinflationary impact of subdued domestic demand, both urban and rural (Chart II.6a).5 Perishable goods (non-durable goods with a 7-day recall6) \u2013 food items such as vegetables, milk and meat products \u2013 were the key drivers, contributing 1.3 percentage points to overall inflation in Q2, 3.7 percentage points in Q3 and 4.0 percentage points in Q4 so far (Chart II.6b). The contribution of less perishable goods (non-durable goods with a 30-day recall) also picked up from Q3:2019-20 due to cereals, Food and beverages (weight: 45.9 per cent in CPI) weighed heavily on changes in the overall CPI inflation during April 2019-February 2020, with the cumulative peak food price build-up in December turning out to be at a historical high (Chart II.7a & II.7b). As a result, food inflation, which had ranged between 0.7 per cent and 4.7 per cent during March-September 2019, accelerated thereafter to peak at 12.2 per cent in December (Chart II.8a). Most of this upsurge was propelled by a vegetables price spike as a consequence of unseasonal rains; however, broad-basing of price 5 Historical decompositions are used to estimate the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period, based on a vector auto regression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 the annual growth rate in crude oil prices; inflation; the output gap; the annual growth rate in rural wages and the policy repo rate. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et ; where et represents a vector of shocks [oil price shock; supply shock (inflation shock); output gap shock; wage shock; and policy shock]. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. 6 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period (MMRP) data based on the 2011-12 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). Under MMRP, data on expenditure incurred are collected for frequently purchased items \u2013 for edible oil, eggs, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, spices, beverages, processed foods, pan, tobacco and intoxicants, during the last seven days; for clothing, bedding, footwear, education, medical (institutional), durable goods, during the last 365 days; and for all other food, fuel and light, miscellaneous goods and services including non-institutional medical services, rents and taxes, during the last 30 days. 7 India\u2019s imports are dominated by crude petroleum & petroleum products (around 25.0 per cent of the total imports. The other major components of imports are electronic goods (11.0 per cent), gold and silver (8.0 per cent), chemical and chemical products (6.0 per cent), metal and metal products (6.0 per cent), pears and precious stones (6.0 per cent) and vegetables oils (2.0 per cent). Also, the domestic prices of items such as raw cotton move in tandem with international cotton prices. Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI. pressures across the food category was observed in H2:2019-20 encompassing pulses, meat and fish, spices, eggs, cereals and milk (Chart II.8b). Food inflation moderated sequentially in January and Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI- Food and beverages. Price increases in respect of cereals (weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group) were sharper in H2: 2019-20. Wheat prices were driven up by higher procurement at upwardly revised minimum support prices (MSPs) and significantly lower imports [(-)39 per cent lower during April 2019-January 2020]. Non-public distribution system (PDS) rice prices emerged out of 11 months of deflation in October 2019 and gained momentum thereafter in the wake of damage to kharif crops due to unseasonal rain in October and early November 2019. They started to moderate from February 2020 due to large carry forward stocks, better rabi harvest prospects and lower exports. Inflation in prices of vegetables (weight of 6.0 per cent in the CPI and 13.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) rose to double digits from September 2019 and peaked at 60.5 per cent in December 2019, reflecting the impact of crop losses and supply disruptions due to excessive and unseasonal rains (Chart II.9a). With the arrival of the late kharif harvest, a delayed seasonal easing in vegetables prices started in January 2020. The year 2019-20 will likely be unique in vegetable price pressures, as the severe supply shock completely overshadowed the seasonal pattern of usual winter easing in prices of vegetables, particularly onions, tomatoes and potatoes which brings relief from the price build-up during the preceding months of the year (Chart II.9b). In India, a societal intolerance to inflation in double digits stands out starkly in political discourse. This is best exemplified in social responses to inflation in onion prices. In 2019-20, onion prices surged from September 2019, with inflation in this category spiking to 327 per cent in December 2019 and contributing a staggering 4.7 percentage points to including Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI-Vegetables. Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in overall CPI. food inflation and 2.1 percentage points to headline inflation. This unpleasant inflation surprise exposed the time lags and lack of adequate band-width of supply-side measures such as imposing minimum export price (MEP) of US$ 850 per tonnes, banning export of onions, and imposing stock holding limits on wholesale traders and retailers in September 2019, as well as announcing import of 1.2 lakh tonnes of onions from Turkey, Afghanistan and Egypt during November-December 2019. It was only with the arrival of late kharif crop from January 2020 that onion prices began moderating. The ferocious pace of onion price escalation and the extent of spillovers highlight the urgent need for supply side reforms (Box II.1). As inflation-sensitive vegetables, potato prices remained in deflation from April 2019 to October 2019, despite a pick-up in prices during this period, largely due to favourable base effects. The momentum of potato prices remained broadly positive during April 2019-January 2020, firmed up by crop loss and supply disruptions from excess/ unseasonal rains during October-November 2019 in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, which was reflected in lower mandi arrivals. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that cyclone bulbul resulted in delayed sowing in West Bengal by around 20 days. As a result, potato price inflation rose to 62.9 per cent in January 2020, before moderating to 47.0 per cent in February 2020 due to fresh arrivals on the back of production turning out to be higher by 3.5 per cent in 2019-20. On the other hand, inflation in tomato prices moderated from its peak of 70 per cent in May 2019 and remained in high double digits during October-December 2019, reflecting untimely rains and associated supply disruptions. Beginning January 2020, tomato price inflation started moderating in the usual seasonal downturn and turned into deflation in February 2020 at (-)4.3 per cent. The onion price shock of 2019 is the largest in recent times in terms of magnitude and duration (Chart II.1.1). In order to understand this, in many ways, unprecedented experience, the dynamics of the transmission of onion price shocks from various wholesale markets to all India average retail prices are evaluated with a vector autoregressive (VAR) model using daily data on price of onions from wholesale and retail markets with the following specification: where Yt represents the vector of daily prices of onion in the key wholesale markets, viz. Jodhpur, Kurnool, Nashik, Pune and Others (average of other markets), and the average all-India retail prices; et represents the vector of supply and demand shocks \u2013 shocks corresponding to wholesale market prices represent the supply shocks and the shock corresponding to average retail market price represents the demand shock. The estimates are based on daily wholesale and retail price data provided by Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), Government of India from August 5, 2019 to February 28, 2020. The historical decomposition of average retail prices points to onion price shocks from the wholesale markets of Maharashtra in early-October and thereafter spreading to Karnataka by early-November and almost immediately getting transmitted to all-India retail prices, exacerbated by widening of price margins between wholesale and retail markets. By end-January, the onion price shocks completely reversed (Chart II.1.2). Given that onion production in India in any given year comfortably meets demand with additional produce available for exports, this analysis underscores the need for refining the supply management policies in managing the volatility in onion prices. The contours of more effective supply management for onions need to centre around the following: (1) making available better information systems to farmers on weather and the production outlook so as to enable them better plan onion production for the year ahead; (2) initiating reforms in the agricultural marketing systems to encourage direct sale of farm produce by farmers to consumers; (3) strengthening initiatives like e-NAM for better price discovery; (4) improving storage facilities for farmers so as to avoid distress sales; (5) creating an adequate buffer stock of rabi produce to help manage supply disruptions during leaner kharif and late-kharif seasons; and (6); encouraging food processing initiatives \u2013 dehydrating onions to convert into powder and paste forms that can be made available at a reasonable price. In fact, most of the onion price spikes in the past have occurred in kharif and late-kharif seasons, pointing to the key role of supply-side management policies in mitigating onion price spikes. 5.2 per cent in the food and beverages group) were emerged out of 9 months of deflation in September 2019 to reach a level of 5.8 per cent in January in this category picking up considerably to reach 16.6 February 2020, fruit price inflation eased to 4.0 per April 2019. This reflected a decline in kharif pulses cent. Banana prices have seen a sustained decline since November 2019. On the other hand, apple prices started a decline from August 2019 itself on the back of higher market arrivals consequent on production being higher by 18.0 per cent during 2019-20, although prices recovered somewhat since January 2020. though imports were higher by 25 per cent during Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI-Pulses and products. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. April 2019-January 2020 y-o-y, they failed to mitigate the rising price pressures in pulses. Besides vegetables and pulses, prices of animal-based protein-rich items were another pressure point, contributing 20.4 per cent to overall food inflation in 2019-20. Inflation in the case of meat and fish remained elevated during April 2019-January 2020 and reached 10.6 per cent in January 2020 (highest in last 72 months). The prices of meat and fish increased significantly during the year (except during the lean season of August-October 2019) reflecting higher feed prices (especially, maize and soybean) on account of unseasonal rains, which accentuated seasonal price pressures. Concomitantly, egg price inflation also inched up to 10.5 per cent in January 2020 from 1.9 per cent in April 2019, but softened to 7.3 per cent in February 2020. Prices of both chicken and egg contracted sharply in February 2020 on account of a fall in consumption due to COVID-19 scare. Prices of milk and milk products (weight of 6.6 per cent in the CPI and 14.4 per cent in the food and beverages group) also contributed to higher food inflation. Co- operatives like Amul and Mother Dairy raised retail milk prices for the second time (first round in May 2019) in December 2019 in the range of ` 2-3 per litre due to increased procurement prices. Many state milk co-operatives also announced increases in prices, which kept the momentum of milk and its products at an elevated level during the year. Procurement prices were raised in response to the increase in the cost of production. Additionally, higher global prices for skimmed milk products also impacted domestic milk prices positively. Milk inflation hardened to a 56-month high of 6.0 per cent in February 2020. Sugar and confectionery prices (weight of 1.4 per cent in the CPI and 3.0 per cent in the food and beverages group) emerged out of four months of continuous deflation in October 2019, partly due to adverse base effects. Despite domestic and global production shortfalls, higher than expected domestic availability due to last year\u2019s carry forward stock has helped keep domestic price pressures under check. Inflation in prices of edible oils and fats also edged up during the year from 0.7 per cent in April 2019 to 7.6 per cent in February 2020. Higher edible oils inflation emerged from a combination of rising international prices, lower domestic production of rabi oilseeds and adverse base effects. Higher milk prices also impacted the prices of ghee and butter. Price pressures picked up considerably in spices leading to a gradual hardening of inflation in this group to 8.8 per cent in February 2020 from 0.8 per cent in April 2019 due to overall lower production. Prices of the CPI fuel group, which sank into deflation in July at (-)0.3 per cent, continued in negative territory till November 2019 as prices of key fuel items such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), firewood and chips and dung cake moved into deep deflation. The fuel group moved out of deflation in December registering a sharp rise thereafter, taking inflation in this category to 6.4 per cent by February. A pick-up in prices of electricity, LPG and firewood and chips and strong adverse base effects contributed to this upsurge (Chart II.11a). International propane and butane prices, which were declining through H1:2019-20, registered sustained price increases during October 2019-January 2020, accentuated by supply disruptions due to geopolitical tensions. These pressures were also transmitted to domestic LPG prices with a lag in February 2020 (Chart II.11b). Administered kerosene price inflation remained sticky and elevated reflecting calibrated price increases by oil marketing companies (OMCs) to phase out the fuel subsidy. By early February, however, administered prices were above market rates, particularly due to the sudden plunge in international prices. This led to a reduction in kerosene prices in the PDS during March-April (Chart II.11c). Notes: (1) The international price for LPG is based on spot prices for Saudi Butane and Propane, combined in the ratio of 60:40 respectively. These international product prices are indicative import prices. Further details are available at www.ppac.org.in.

CPI inflation excluding food and fuel or core inflation picked up sequentially from 3.4 per cent in October 2019 to 4.3 per cent in January 2020, before registering some moderation in February 2020 (Chart II.12). In terms of components, the price Notes: (1) Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI. (2) Dervided as residual from headline CPI. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. Note: Figures in parentheses indicate weights in CPI excluding food and fuel. Sources: NSO; and RBI staff estimates. build-up during 2019-20 was much lower than historical averages, barring for the transport and communication, and personal care and effects sub- groups (Chart II.13). Volatile movements in international crude oil prices and the consequent increase in domestic pump prices mainly contributed to the upturn in CPI excluding food and fuel inflation till January 2020 and the subsequent moderation in February. CPI petrol and diesel, which was in deflation for 11 months till November 2019, saw a sharp uptick in inflation during December 2019-January 2020 before moderating in February. Volatility in crude oil prices in H2:2019- 20 emanated from a series of events starting with rising geo-political tensions in early September, followed by production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)-plus in early December and renewed geo-political tensions in early January. Crude oil prices moderated sharply from mid-January on easing of geo-political tensions, price war between OPEC and Russia, and fears of a global recession due to COVID-19. While the pass- through of collapse in international crude oil prices to domestic pump prices is still unfolding, its extent has been tempered by increases in taxes on petrol and diesel (Chart II.14a). Excise duties for petrol and diesel were increased by ` 3 per litre each on March 14, 2020 as international crude oil prices tumbled below US$ 40 per barrel. With this increase, the total excise duty on petrol and diesel works out to ` 22.98 per litre and ` 18.83 per litre, respectively. The divergence between international and domestic pump prices has now widened to highest levels seen in the recent period (Chart II.14b). Note: International petrol prices denote the spot price of Singapore gasoline. Domestic prices represent the average pump prices at four metros from Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL). Note: September 2013 represents the peak level for petrol prices in India. CPI inflation excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel troughed in December, before registering a sharp increase in Q4 so far (January-February). CPI inflation excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold, silver \u2013 which further excludes the volatile gold and silver price effects \u2013 also saw similar movements (Chart II.12). A break-up of CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel into its good and services components, shows the impact of cost-push factors which reversed a sharp moderation in inflation in this category and hardened it during December 2019- January 2020 (Chart II.15). Core goods prices inflation moderated sequentially till December 2019, caused by a broad-based fall in inflation across goods items, particularly health inflation due to large and favourable base effects. Goods inflation has been ticking up since January due to firming up of prices of clothing, pan, tobacco, medicines in the health sub-group following an increase in administered prices of essential medicines and automobiles in the transport and communication sub-group due to a rise in input costs and a switch- over in emission norms to BS-VI (Chart II.15a). Core services inflation moderated sharply during October-November 2019 due to a fall in inflation in domestic maid/cook and other household services; tuition fees in education services; house rentals; transport fares and mobile telephone charges under transportation and communication services. Mobile telephone charges have, however, increased (by close to 12 per cent between November 2019 and February 2020), following the increase in tariffs by major private mobile operators in early December. Bus fares and administered railway fares also increased during this period. As a result, transport and communication services inflation registered significant increases, pushing up overall services inflation. Reflecting subdued demand conditions, housing inflation softened throughout H2:2019-20. Education services inflation also remained soft during December 2019-February 2020 (Chart II.15b). increased August-December 2019, driven up primarily by the unseasonal rise in food prices. The pace of increase, however, softened in January-February 2020, on the back of cooling of prices in the food group. Inflation in food and fuel components of CPI-AL and CPI-RL was higher than that in headline CPI. A larger share of food nudged overall inflation measured by these indices to double digit levels during December 2019-February 2020. global commodity prices. Subsequently, WPI inflation edged up in line with sectoral CPIs as wholesale food prices rose in December 2019-January 2020 before moderating again in February with easing of food prices. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross Value Added (GVA) deflators picked up in Q3:2019-20 after reaching a record low in Q2:2019-20, indicating a clear divergence with CPI and a broad alignment with WPI (Chart II.16a). In the case of CPI-IW, with the complete waning of the house rent allowance impact of the seventh central pay commission (CPC) after December 2019, inflation registered a sharp fall, closing the gap with headline CPI. Notwithstanding this ebbing, the latest increase in momentum in housing index in CPI-IW \u2013 which is revised once in six months, in January and July every year \u2013 contributed the largest upward push to CPI-IW in January 2020 (with a m-o-m increase of 3.7 percentage points). CPI-IW inflation decreased further in February 2020 due to sharp correction in food prices by 1.7 percentage points. Inflation in terms of the wholesale price index (WPI) fell during August-October 2019 in sharp contrast to the sectoral CPIs, due to a decline in prices of non-food manufactured products on account of the softening of Trimmed mean measures of inflation, obtained by statistically removing outliers and eliminating positive and negative skew, provide a measure of underlying inflation movements. Exclusion based measures of CPI also capture persistent trends in inflation by removing components that are considered idiosyncratic. Over the last six months, both trimmed means and exclusion-based measures, have firmed up (Charts II.12 and II.16b). Underlying cost conditions have largely been in sync with inflation in terms of the WPI (Chart II.17). Inflation in terms of farm inputs and industrial raw material prices (extracted from WPI) moderated significantly after April 2019 and remained in negative territory during September-November 2019, before registering a pick up during December 2019-February 2020. The pick-up during December 2019-January 2020 partly reflected recovery in prices of global crude oil and petrochemicals as well as adverse base effects. In addition, cost of minerals and non-food articles also influenced the recent price dynamics of non-farm input costs. which carry a high weight in both industrial and farm inputs, recorded a modest increase during the year, reflecting weak demand conditions. Inflation in terms of agricultural machinery and implements costs has also softened gradually during the current financial year. Among other industrial raw materials, domestic coal inflation picked up to 2.4 per cent during October 2019-February 2020 from 0.4 per cent in April 2019 in line with the increase in international coal prices. Prices of paper and paper products remained in deflation during July 2019-February 2020 due to lower raw material cost, including that of pulp. In the case of fibres, deflation persisted during August 2019-February 2020, following easing in prices of raw cotton and coir fibre, which also reflected in the contraction in cotton yarn prices during the same period. As regards farm sector inputs, inflation hardened in the case of fodder due to unseasonal rains, while some easing was observed in the case of fertilisers and pesticides reflecting generally subdued momentum in international fertiliser prices. Prices of electricity, Growth in nominal rural wages, both for agricultural and non-agricultural labourers, remained subdued averaging around 3.4 per cent and 3.3 per cent, respectively, during 2019-20 so far (up to January 2020) mainly reflecting continued slowdown in the construction sector (Chart II.18). With a sharp rise in rural retail inflation, however, real rural wage growth has been negative as derived from CPI-AL and CPI-RL measures since March 2019 and CPI-rural inflation since September 2019. Growth in organised sector staff costs showed divergent movements for services and manufacturing firms. While staff cost growth of services firms increased in Q3:2019-20 over the previous quarter, it declined for manufacturing firms. Unit labour costs (ratio of staff cost to value of production in percentage terms) for companies in the manufacturing sector increased per cent in Q2:2019-20 to 27.9 per cent in Q3 even as staff cost increased somewhat (Chart II.19). alongside an increase in staff cost. In Q3:2019-20, unit labour cost for manufacturing moderated marginally. of production for firms in the services sector led to a Manufacturing firms participating in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey reported muted cost pressures in Q3:2019-20 and Q4. This reflected softening of inflation in farm and industrial raw materials in Q3 and weak metal and other commodity price pressures in Q4. A decline in cost of finance was also reported by the companies polled in Q3 and Q4. Cost pressures on account of salary outgoes also fell in Q3 and are expected to have remained weak in Q4. Weak demand conditions and muted input price pressures kept selling prices soft, with expectations showing only a muted uptick in Q4. While producers\u2019 price expectations were subdued, inflation expectations of households, as measured in the Reserve Bank survey, softened. landscape changed dramatically swings in onion prices. In Q4:2019-20, before the intensification of COVID-19, forward looking surveys were already indicating weak consumer March 2020 the inflation outlook has become highly Manufacturing firms polled for the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) reported modest increases in input prices and stable output prices in Q4. Input prices, however, firmed up markedly in case of the PMI services firms in Q4 (up to February) driven by higher food, labour and material costs before slowing sharply in March 2020 amid lower food and fuel prices, and reduced demand. Prices charged by services firms remained broadly range bound in Q3 and Q4 but softened in March 2020 with some firms reducing their fees due to weak demand conditions. uncertain due to the COVID-19 outbreak turning into a pandemic. Crude oil prices have collapsed to lows not seen since early 2000s. With several major may weaken sharply. Accordingly, countries across the world are bracing up for deflationary forces to take hold. India may not be immune to these extreme downside pressures imparted by the pandemic. With The deterioration in aggregate demand conditions in 2019-20, was exacerbated by contraction in investment, and moderation in government expenditure in H2. On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities accelerated, buoyed by the late surge in south-west monsoon rainfall and bountiful north-east monsoon precipitation. However, industrial growth decelerated, led by a slowdown in manufacturing activity. Services sector activity moderated, pulled down by a slowdown in construction; trade, hotels, transport and communication; and public administration, defence and other services. The February 2020 data release by the National Statistical Office (NSO) reveals that a sequential slowdown set in upon the Indian economy from Q1:2018-19. Over H2:2018-19 and H1:2019-20, real GDP growth lost momentum further, averaging 5.5 per cent. The sub-5 per cent reading for Q3:2019-20 (4.7 per cent) has caused heightened uncertainty about the outlook. The oppressive force of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on weak or moderating high frequency indicators of activity, barring agriculture, indicates that the implicit real GDP growth for Q4:2019-20 in the NSO\u2019s data release could be undershot by a fair margin. In fact, the widening incidence of COVID-19 in March 2020 may produce downward pulls to Q4 GDP. for January and February 2020 either moderating or declining, barring PMI, cement production and railway freight traffic. Public administration, defence and other services (PADO) remained robust in Q2 and Q3. However, during January-February 2020, centre\u2019s revenue expenditure excluding interest payments and subsidies grew marginally. Beginning March, the lockdown in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19 has choked manufacturing activities. Anecdotal evidence suggests that in the manufacturing sector, dislocations of labour adversely impacted automobiles, electronic goods and appliances, and apparel. Services such as trade, tourism, airlines, the hospitality sector and construction have been hit hard. Underlying this marked downturn relative to recent experience is the contraction in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) from Q2:2019-20. Consumption demand accelerated and sustained overall demand, driven mainly by a sharp pick up in government final consumption expenditure (GFCE). Net exports also contributed positively to aggregate demand, but essentially because the contraction in imports outpaced the decline in exports. On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities imparted momentum to gross value added (GVA) in Q2 and Q3, buoyed by increases in kharif and horticulture production. The industrial sector remained moribund, bound down by weak demand conditions, and hence weak pricing power. In the services sector, activity has been weakening through H2:2019-20 with high frequency indicators The deterioration in aggregate demand conditions in 2019-20, was exacerbated by contraction (1.3 per cent) in gross fixed capital formation, and moderation in government expenditure in H2. Although private consumption held up in sequential terms, it was slower in H2:2019-20 on a y-o-y basis (Chart III.1a and Table III.1). Overall, the drag on GDP growth in H2:2019-20 can be decoded to unfavourable base effects, since momentum \u2013 measured by the q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised growth rate (SAAR) - accelerated in H2 (Chart III.1b). With COVID-19 having taken a grievous toll in February and particularly in March, it is unlikely that this momentum was sustained as the year closed. Accordingly, the NSO\u2019s estimate of real GDP growth for the year as a whole at 5.0 per cent in 2019-20, which itself was down from 6.1 per cent in 2018-19, may be at risk.

In the absence of hard data on underlying activity from traditional sources, availability of high frequency information in large volumes, either structured or unstructured, varying in form and content, has opened up avenues for extracting meaningful signals on the state of the economy. A sentiment index (SI), prepared on the basis of daily news feed in print media is able to track economic activity relatively well in the Indian context. The SI indicates weak activity in Q4:2019-20 (Box III.1).

Source: NSO. Big data tools and machine learning (ML) techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and text mining have facilitated extraction and construction of numerical indicators out of news text (Shapiro et. al. 2018). The broad approach is to extract sentiment from daily news items pertaining to variables of interest (Godbole et. al. 2007). Each news item is classified into one of three sentiment classes, viz., positive, negative and neutral, based on the words present in the news. News items with no sentiments or those that are unrelated are discarded. A sentiment class explicitly represents words with similar semantic orientation as illustrated below (Chart III.1.1). Relevant news items under positive/ negative/ neutral sentiment class are consolidated and summarised into a Sentiment Index (SI)1, as defined below: For this analysis, daily news feeds for the period April 2015 to March 2020 have been sourced from media intelligence firm (Meltwater) and aggregated to derive a quarterly Sentiment Index to track upturns and downturns in year- on-year (y-o-y) growth in real GDP and GVA (Chart III.1.2). The association between sentiment index and economic activity (GDP or GVA growth) is measured in terms of correlation. Directional precision is measured in terms of a Sign Success Ratio (SSR)2 which is the proportion of time periods when the direction indicated by SI matches the directional change in GDP/GVA growth and is defined as follows: as the variable representing whether the year on year growth for the quarter has increased/ decreased/remained same sequentially and defined by 1 The range of SI is -100 to 100. While a positive (negative) value of SI indicates optimism/ improvement (pessimism/deterioration), a zero value is associated with neutral sentiment. 2 A high value of SSR, which is close to 100 in a scale of 0 to 100, indicates that media sentiment is able to gauge directional changes in the macroeconomic variables of interest (Buono et. al. 2018). is Y-o-Y growth in GDP or GVA for quarter t. as the variable indicating whether the sentiment index for the quarter is positive/negative/ neutral and defined by as an indicator function for the quarter Denote capturing whether the sequential direction of GDP/ GVA growth and the sentiment index of the quarter are directionally matching or not. It is defined by Unconventional big data sources, such as news in online print media that are available on a high frequency basis complement survey-based gauges of the pulse of the economy. However, machine learning techniques are usually difficult to comprehend with macroeconomic interlinkages and are generally treated as additional monitoring techniques. Under the above settings, the sign success ratio ( defined as ) is where n is the total number of quarters under consideration (during Q1: 2015-16 to Q3:2019-20). The Sentiment index is found to be strongly correlated with both GDP and GVA growth and it is able to gauge the directional change satisfactorily (Table III.1.1). Sentiment index reveals subdued economic activities for the fourth quarter of 2019-20. The October 2019 Monetary Policy Report (MPR) projected GDP growth at 5.3 per cent for Q2:2019- 20, 6.6 per cent for Q3 and 7.2 per cent for Q4, with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path (Chart III.2). Actual outcomes in terms of the NSO\u2019s second advance estimates (SAE) undershot these projections by 20 and 190 basis points in Q2 and Q3, respectively. The downward surprise in Q2 stemmed from a stronger than anticipated drag from gross fixed capital formation and marginal weakness in private final consumption expenditure. In Q3, projection errors emanated mainly from a steep unanticipated contraction in gross fixed capital formation, which was the deepest in the new series of GDP. Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) remains the mainstay of aggregate demand, with its share at 57.6 per cent in H2:2019-20. The slowdown in PFCE in H2:2019-20 was caused by a combination of factors \u2014 weak rural demand due to depressed food prices/ inflation in the previous two years; deceleration in rural wages; and downturn in labour-intensive exports which impacted rural consumption; and slowdown in urban consumption due to decelerating incomes (Chart III.3). High frequency indicators of urban consumption demand present a subdued picture for Q4:2019-20 (Chart III.4a). Sales of passenger vehicles continued to contract in February 2020. Domestic air passenger traffic growth slowed in January 2020. Consumer durables growth contracted in January 2020. Even though there has been some uptick in vehicle loan growth for households and growth in credit card outstanding in February 2020, overall, urban consumption appears to have lost steam in Q4 with the outbreak of COVID-19 having accentuated the moderation (Chart III.4b). rural consumption, indicators of Among motorcycle sales in in contraction remained February 2020 (Chart III.5). This sector faces some uncertainty following the change in emission norms, which was to be effective from April. Tractor sales, however, improved in January and steadied further improved in February 2020, reflecting rabi sowing. The consumer non-durable segment remained in contraction, reflecting weak rural demand (Box III.2). The performance of agriculture is key to the state of rural demand. In recent years, the terms of trade (ToT) have moved against the farm economy, with back-to-back bumper harvests during 2016, 2017 and 2018 causing a decline in some food prices/inflation (Chart III.2.1). In the face of a global food supply glut, India\u2019s exports of agricultural products were affected and consequently, they could not fulfil their usual vent for surplus role (Chart III.2.2). The excess supply resulting in an accumulation of stocks depressed agriculture commodities prices/inflation even further (Chart III.2.3). The index of inter-sectoral ToT, i.e., the ratio of agriculture GVA deflator to non-agriculture GVA deflator declined between 2016-17 and 2018-19 (Chart III.2.4). An alternative measure \u2013 the ratio of the wholesale price index (WPI) between agriculture and non-agriculture (excluding services) \u2013 corroborates this loss of ToT. Alongside these developments, growth in rural wages has remained subdued, particularly for agricultural labour in both nominal and real terms, partly due to the slowdown in the construction sector (Chart III.2.5). Moreover, in recent years, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme does not seem to support rural income much due to delayed wage payments, lower wages and insufficient budgetary allocations. The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) report released by the NSO in May 2019 shows that wages under MGNREGA work are lower than the market wage rate for non-public work by 74 per cent for rural men and 21 per cent for rural women. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown enforced in the country are expected to bring down the aggregate demand drastically, both in rural and urban areas. The Government has announced a slew of measures like direct cash transfer to farmers, hiking wages under the MGNREGA scheme, and utilisation of welfare funds for construction workers to offset the adverse impact on rural demand. However, given the severity of the pandemic, rural demand is expected to go down further at least in the near future. In conclusion, unusually lower agriculture prices, slowdown in the construction sector and below average performance of the flagship MGNREGA programme have contributed to lower farm incomes, deceleration in rural wages and loss of employment opportunities in the rural sector and, more so, in the wake of COVID-19. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth turned negative in Q2 and Q3:2019-20. Consequently, the share of GFCF in GDP dropped to 30.2 per cent in 2019- 20 from 31.9 per cent a year ago. Two key indicators of investment demand, viz., production and imports of capital goods have remained in contraction in January/February 2020 as well (Chart III.6a). As regards construction activity, finished steel consumption contracted in February, while cement production grew significantly. The performance of software firms \u2013 a proxy for investment in intellectual property products \u2013 has remained resilient, as evident from the latest financial results. Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation (CU-SA) in the manufacturing sector declined below the long-term average in Q3:2019-20, corroborating that the need for fresh investment is depressed as also reflected in a slowdown in adjusted non-food bank credit (ANFC) (Chart III.6b). Half-yearly unaudited financial statements of listed non-government non-financial (NGNF) companies suggest a rise in the capex ratio3 in H1:2019-20 from H2:2018-19 across major industries such as motor vehicles, cement, petroleum, telecommunications and construction (Chart III.7). Funds mobilised by these corporates during H1:2019-20 were mainly used for fixed assets formation and deleveraging (reduced borrowing). The total cost of projects sanctioned/ contracted by major financing channels also increased in H1:2019-20 over H1:2018-19. As per the first revised estimates, gross domestic saving (GDS) rate decreased to 30.1 per cent of GDP in 2018-19 from 32.4 per cent in 2017-18. The saving rate of the household sector, which is a net supplier of funds to the economy, declined from 23.6 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 to 18.2 per cent in 2018-19. While the private corporate sector finances its investment predominantly through its own savings, the public sector continues to rely heavily on households for financing its deficit (Chart III.8). During April- December 2019, household financial savings appeared to have improved as households\u2019 liabilities declined more than the increase in household deposits with scheduled commercial banks whereas their investment in insurance and mutual funds remained at the same level as in the previous year. 3 Capex ratio is defined as [net fixed assets (current half year) - net fixed assets (previous half year) + depreciation (current half year)]/net fixed assets (previous half year). Growth in government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) moderated in H2:2019-20 due to a sharp slowdown in Q4 as implicit in the SAE released by the NSO. During January-February 2020, revenue expenditure of the Centre grew by 3.9 per cent. In 2020-21, revenue expenditure is budgeted higher than in 2019-20 revised estimates (RE) (Table III.2). During 2019-20 (April-February), the fiscal position of the central government deteriorated mainly due to a decline in gross revenue under corporation tax, reflecting mid-year cut in tax rates. GST collections at `5.5 lakh crore were 89.5 per cent of RE and 4.5 per cent higher than a year ago. On the whole, direct taxes Note: BE: Budget Estimates. RE: Revised Estimates. Source: Union Budget, 2020-21. contracted by 3.3 per cent, while indirect taxes grew barely by 1.6 per cent in the first 11 months of the year, lower than the budget estimates (BE) (Chart III.9 a & b). Revenue expenditure growth also stood lower than the RE mainly due to lower interest payments. Outgoes on account of major subsidies moderated from the BE of 1.4 per cent of GDP to 1.1 per cent in RE due to curtailment of on-budget food subsidy. Nonetheless, food subsidy continues to dominate the overall subsidy bill. Capital expenditure growth was also lower than in the RE. Under the provisions of section 4(3) of the revised FRBM Act, which can be invoked under specific conditions4, the Centre\u2019s GFD was revised up to 3.8 per cent of GDP in 2019-20 (RE) from the budgeted evolving dynamics can be examined in a general equilibrium framework (Box III.3). The GFD is budgeted to moderate to 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2020- 21 and in a glide path it will return to 3.1 per cent Fiscal policy measures can impact output, inflation and monetary policy decisions and vice versa (Government of India, 2017). However, all fiscal measures need not affect the macroeconomic variables in a similar way. The various conduits of fiscal-monetary interface and their impact on growth and inflation are assessed by incorporating a fiscal block in RBI\u2019s Quarterly Projection Model (QPM)5. Salient features of the fiscal block in the QPM are the following: (a) headline fiscal deficit is decomposed into structural and cyclical primary deficits and interest payments; (b) the cyclical component of the primary deficit depends on the state of the economy and recognises that government tax revenue will be lower and expenditure will be higher leading to higher fiscal deficit when the overall 4 On ground or grounds of national security, act of war, national calamity, collapse of agriculture severely affecting farm output and incomes, structural reforms in the economy with unanticipated fiscal implications, and decline in real output growth of a quarter by at least three per cent points below its average of the previous four quarters (Source: Finance Act, 2018). 5 The QPM is a semi-structural, forward-looking, open economy, calibrated, gap model in the New Keynesian tradition and provides an internally consistent analysis of various feedback mechanisms. economy slows down and vice versa; (c) deviation of the fiscal deficit from the announced fiscal path on account of cyclically-adjusted (i.e., structural \u2013 the part of fiscal deficit which is not related to the state of the economy) component of the primary deficit is a fiscal impulse and contributes to aggregate demand; (d) link between debt dynamics and fiscal deficit is identified for stock-flow consistency (Escolano, 2010); (e) the fiscal deficit and debt has implications for the country risk premium and the exchange rate; and (f) monetary policy\u2019s interaction with the fiscal deficit is captured through interest payments (Chart III.3.1). The model\u2019s dynamics indicate that a shock to the cyclically-adjusted impacts aggregate demand. The higher level of debt to finance higher fiscal deficit leads to increase in country risk premium and exchange rate depreciation. Thus, inflation gets impacted through both the aggregate demand and exchange rate channels. However, if the deviation of the headline fiscal position from the announced path is on account of cyclical factors, the impact on inflation and output would be muted (Chart III.3.2). In 2019-20, the GDP growth has slowed down, which contributed to an increase in the fiscal deficit mainly on account of (a) lower aggregate demand (denominator), (b) lower fiscal revenue due to lower economic activity, and (c) higher fiscal expenditure on account of the measures to address the economic slowdown. Thus, a considerable portion of the fiscal deficit deviation in 2019-20 could be attributed to cyclical factors. In such scenario, the inflationary impact of this deviation was largely subdued.

GSDP is the sum of GSDP of respective 22 states. out during H2:2019-20 with the objective of managing redemption and enhancing liquidity of government securities. Furthermore, cash management bills worth `2,50,000 crore were issued on seven occasions during H2:2019-20 to tide over frequent recourse to ways and means advances/overdrafts in the face of negative cash balances with the Reserve Bank. States completed their gross borrowings of `6,34,521 crore for the year (Table III.4). Based on the latest available data, the gross fiscal deficit of 22 states increased to 2.9 per cent of their gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 2019-20 (RE) from the budgeted 2.5 per cent (Table III.3). The deviation was mainly caused by lower revenue \u2013 both own and central transfer \u2013 due to the slowdown in economic activity, which, in turn, induced states to cut both revenue and capital expenditure in an adverse feedback loop that further weakened aggregate demand. For 2020-21, states have budgeted a consolidated GFD of 2.4 per cent of GSDP, anticipating higher revenue and lower expenditure than a year ago. Under the centre\u2019s market borrowing programme during 2019-20, that is managed by the Reserve Bank, gross borrowings were `2,68,000 crore during H2:2019-20, as compared to `2,83,000 crore during H2:2018-19, i.e., lower by 5.3 per cent than their level a year ago. Net market borrowings during H2:2019-20 at `1,33,000 crore were also 43.2 per cent lower. As part of active debt consolidation, seven tranches of switch operations worth `1,24,694 crore were carried Net exports contributed positively to aggregate demand in H2:2019-20, with imports contracting more sharply than exports (Chart 10). According to data released by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S), the contraction in merchandise exports, which started in Q1:2019-20, accentuated in Q2, as the slump in shipment of engineering goods, gems and jewellery, cotton and handloom products, and rice became pronounced in the face of a prolonged slowdown in world trade and demand. The pace of overall export contraction moderated during Q3:2019-20, and eventually there was a turnaround in February, supported by petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL), engineering goods, electronic goods and chemicals (Chart III.11a). Overall, exports shrank by 1.5 per cent during April-February 2019-20, though the adverse impact of COVID-19 on global supply chains and global economic activity more generally may dent export performance in March. Imports contracted in Q2:2019-20, pulled down by gold, POL and non-POL non-gold imports (Chart III.11b). Within the latter, the decline was broad-based and covered sectors such as transport equipment, pearls and precious stones, coal and chemicals. Imports also contracted in Q3 and in January 2020, but expanded in February, driven by POL, pearls and precious stones and machinery. Overall, imports contracted by 7.3 per cent during April-February 2019-20. With imports declining more than exports, the trade deficit narrowed from US$ 173.0 billion in April-February 2018-19 to US$ 143.1 billion in April- February 2019-20. India\u2019s oil import bill is expected to and this may compress the trade deficit further for the The current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 0.2 contraction in the CAD was primarily on account of a Services exports grew on the back of a rise in net earnings from software, travel and financial services (Chart 10.b). Remittances from overseas Indians were strong in Q3:2019-20, while the net outgo of payments due to investment income and compensation of employees together, remained broadly unchanged from the previous year. those of US$ 2.0 billion a year ago. Net International Investment Position (IIP), i.e., the difference between a country\u2019s external financial assets and liabilities, improved during Q3:2019-20 over Q2. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were placed at US$ 475.6 billion, equivalent to 11.8 months of import, as on March 27, 2020 \u2013 an increase of US$ 62.7 billion over the level at end-March 2019. Net capital inflows exceeded the CAD in Q3:2019- 20. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows at US$ 37.8 billion in April-January 2019-20 were higher than those a year ago, flowing mainly to manufacturing, communication, retail and wholesale trade, financial and computer services. Amidst growing risk aversion on fears of global recession in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) turned net sellers beginning February 18, 2020. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows accentuated further from March 6, 2020 as the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia caused fresh turbulence in global financial markets. Overall, FPI outflows were of the order of US$ 7.1 billion in 2019-20 (up to March 31, 2020). Under the voluntary retention route, however, net investment by FPIs amounted to US$ 8.7 billion up to March 31, 2020. Net disbursals under external commercial borrowings (ECBs) by Indian entities at US$ 3.2 billion in Q3:2019-20 were higher than Gross value added (GVA) growth at basic prices \u2013 the metric for aggregate supply \u2013 decelerated to 4.7 per cent in H2:2019-20 from 5.1 per cent in H1 and 5.6 per cent in H2:2018-19 (Table III.5). This deceleration can be attributed to base effects to a large extent since its momentum measured in terms of q-o-q SAAR accelerated to 5.6 per cent in H2 from 4.2 per cent in H1 (Chart III.12a). With COVID-19 impacting the GVA in the last phase of Q4 strongly, it is unlikely that this momentum would be maintained as the year closed. The slowdown in y-o-y GVA growth reflected the deceleration in industrial and services activities. On the other hand, GVA growth in agriculture and allied activities accelerated in H2:2019-20 in comparison with both H1:2019-20 and H2:2018-19, buoyed by the late surge in south-west monsoon rainfall and Agriculture, forestry and fishing Industry Mining and quarrying Manufacturing Electricity, gas, water supply and other utilities Services Construction Trade, hotels, transport, communication Financial, real estate and professional services Public administration, defence and other services GVA at basic prices bountiful north-east monsoon precipitation. Based on the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare\u2019s second advance estimates, production of all major food grains, except urad and moong, in 2019-20 was higher than the final estimates of the preceding year. Public administration, defence and other services (PADO) continued to provide support to overall supply conditions (Chart 12b). GVA growth at basic prices in agriculture and allied activities accelerated in H2:2019-20 to 4.2 per cent from 3.0 per cent in H1:2019-20. Acreage of rabi crops increased by 9.5 per cent, underpinned by the favourable northeast monsoon, sufficient reservoir levels, improved soil moisture and an increase in prices for agricultural commodities. The second advance estimates of crop production for 2019-20 placed kharif and rabi foodgrain production higher by 0.6 and 4.1 per cent, respectively (Table III.6). Horticultural production was placed at a record level of 3,133.5 lakh tonnes during 2019-20, 0.8 per cent higher than the final estimates for 2018-19 and driven largely by production of vegetables. #: Lakh bales of 170 kgs. each. ##: Lakh bales of 180 kgs. each. Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare, Government of India. Allied activities, including livestock, forestry and fishing, constitute about 40 per cent of the GVA in agriculture and allied sector and contributed four- fifths of overall agricultural GVA growth during 2012-19 (Chart III.13). According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), near- to above-average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) prevailed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean during March 2020. There is 65 per cent chance of ENSO6-neutral prevailing in the spring and 55 per cent chance in the summer of 2020. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has indicated that the ENSO Outlook is neutral, suggesting low or no possibility of El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a developing in the coming months. Skymet expects neutral conditions to prevail during monsoon months with more than 50 per cent probability. The India Meteorological Department also expects ENSO- neutral conditions to prevail during April-June 2020. In the industrial sector, GVA growth at basic prices decelerated to 1.3 per cent in H2:2019-20 from 1.7 per cent in the preceding half, and 2.8 per cent a year ago (Chart III. 14). It was the deceleration in the manufacturing sector \u2013 the dominant component of industry \u2013 that deepened this slowdown, due to weak domestic and external demand. The mining sector growth picked up, but electricity generation weakened. Among the high frequency indicators, the index of industrial production (IIP) emerged out of contraction in November 2019 and remained in positive territory in the following two months. The truncated IIP, by taking 96 per cent of IIP, i.e., excluding top 2 per cent and bottom 2 per cent of volatile items, improved marginally in January 2020 (Chart III.15a). Manufacturing IIP contracted in Q3:2019-20, pulled down by a decline in the production of motor vehicles, machinery and equipment, computer, electronic and optical products, fabricated metal products, rubber and plastics products. Of the 23 industry groups constituting the IIP, 17 contracted during Q3 as against 15 during Q2. In terms of the use-based classification, the intermediate goods sector grew by double digits in Q3:2019-20 led by growth in mild steel (MS) slabs. On the other hand, consumer non-durables slipped into contraction (Chart III.15b). Primary goods, infrastructure and consumer durables remained in contraction in Q3. The consumer durables segment contracted in Q3:2019-20 due to the decline in production of two wheelers, TV sets and auto components. The capital goods sector also remained in contraction in Q3 mainly due to weak investment demand pertaining especially to commercial vehicles and power generation. the source of two-thirds of energy supply. Electricity generation increased in December-January 2020, after six months of contraction (Chart III.16). In the mining sector, production picked up marginally in H2 but remained weak. Recent announcements by the Government such as doing away with end-use restrictions in coal mining, extending the validity of In January 2020, while the IIP growth was positive at 2.0 per cent, this was also broad-based. However, its sustainability in the near term seems to be uncertain in view of supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 and weak automobile sales. Intermediate goods continued to register robust growth emanating mostly from mild steel slabs, which contributed 197 basis points to headline IIP growth in January. Capital goods production continued to contract, taking the sequential decline to its thirteenth consecutive month. in generation decelerated Electricity comparison with H1, reflective of low demand from the organised manufacturing sector amidst extended monsoon season. This subdued performance was mainly on account of thermal power generation, clearances for mining leases and opening up of this sector to new participants may spur activity in this sector. due to deterioration in new export business as well as business expectations. The Reserve Bank\u2019s business assessment of the industrial outlook survey (IOS)7 showed improvement in Q4:2019-20, with the sentiment on employment the improved. conditions slightly intensification of COVID-19, a quick survey with select parameters was specially conducted during March 18-20 to capture the updated sentiments of the enterprises. The limited responses received indicate a considerable worsening of the key demand indicators in Q4:2019-20 and the pessimism was more pronounced in the outlook for the next quarter. Manufacturing PMI softened to 51.8 in March from 54.5 in February due to the marked decline in new business order (export); the COVID-19 negatively impacted the supply-side of the sector, with suppliers' delivery times lengthening for the first time in five months. Services PMI moved to contraction zone: 49.3 in March from a seven-year high of 57.5 in February Service sector activity moderated in H2:2019-20, pulled down by a slowdown in construction and trade, hotels, transport and communication and PADO (Chart III.17a). The slowdown in the construction sector was reflected in a decline in one of its key indicators, viz., cement production (Chart III.17b). Growth in trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting was muted in H2:2019-20. Commercial vehicle sales \u2013 a lead indicator for road transport \u2013 continued to contract in H2:2019-20 as the impact of the upward revision in axle norms8 in July 2018 lingered (Chart III.18a). Other constituents of the transport segment like freight traffic by rail, water and air improved marginally in December-February 2019-20 (Chart III.18b). The growth of financial, real estate and professional services accelerated in H2:2019-20, reflecting the 7 The current round of the survey was launched on January 30, 2020 and the results are summarised from 860 responses received till March 18, 2020. 8 Ministry of Road Transport & Highways notified increase in truck axle load of heavy vehicles to raise the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by about 20-25 per cent and lower logistics costs by about 2 per cent on July 18, 2018. robust performance of technology companies in the professional services segment. However, the growth of aggregate deposits and bank credit remained muted (Chart III.19). state governments. This has likely got accentuated in Q4 in view of the tight financial position of the Centre and States: the Union finance ministry has directed all government departments and ministries to restrict their expenditures within the budgeted level. The growth of public administration, defence and other services (PADO) moderated in Q3:2019-20, reflecting subdued revenue expenditure (net of interest payments and subsidies) of the Union and the The residential real estate sector has continued to suffer from low demand and large inventory overhang. As a result, new launches declined in Q3:2019- 20 (Chart III.20 a). Reflecting the large volume of inventory overhang, all-India level housing prices have moderated somewhat (Chart III.20b). The output gap \u2013 the deviation of actual output from its potential level and expressed as a proportion to potential output \u2013 is a summary measure of demand- supply conditions in the economy and an important input for monetary policy formulation, since it provides a \u2018fix\u2019 about the position of the economy vis-\u00e0- vis the underlying business cycle. As potential output is unobservable, it has to be empirically estimated and hence, it is sensitive to the choice of methodology, time period and revisions in data. A variety of measures - univariate filters such as the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, the Baxter-King (BK) filter and the Christiano- composite estimate, by combining all these measures, suggests that the output gap was negative in Q3:2019-20 (Chart III.21). Note: MVKF: Multivariate Kalman Filter. Source: RBI staff estimates. Fitzgerald (CF) filter and the multivariate Kalman filter (MVKF) taking into account inflation developments \u2013 are used to assess the state of business cycle. The In Q3:2019-20, the economy hit a multi-quarter low and going forward, the risks are tilted largely to the downside. Private consumption, in particular, is at serious risk from the COVID-19 pandemic, notwithstanding improved rabi prospects and the recent rise in food prices, and the rationalisation of personal income tax rates in the Union Budget 2020-21 along with measures to boost rural and infrastructure spending. Aggregate demand is expected to be impacted adversely by likely recession in the global economy, caused by disruptions in global supply chains, travel and tourism, and lockdowns in many economies. Domestic production will also be impacted by the nation-wide lockdown. In the near-term, the challenge is to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19. Domestic financial markets were overwhelmingly influenced by evolving domestic and global developments and the outbreak of COVID-19 in India in end-January 2020. Markets witnessed heightened volatility beginning February, culminating into a state of seizure in March with sharp shrinkage in trading activity. Search for safe haven assets and flight to safety resulted in large scale capital outflows which sent equity markets into a tailspin and exerted sharp depreciation pressure on the Indian Rupee. The risk premium in the bond markets increased sharply amidst increasing fears of illiquidity. Global financial markets turned volatile during the latter part of H2:2019-20 against the backdrop of geo-political tensions between Iran and the US and outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the latter overwhelming the positive impact of de- escalation of trade tensions between the US and China and the UK election outcome being conducive to an amicable resolution of Brexit. Towards end-February and early-March, global markets experienced episodic meltdowns as COVID-19 spread out of China to many countries rapidly. The severity of the crisis prompted emergency rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve on March 3 and March 15, 2020. Similar moves by the central banks in Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and several others were backed up by measures, both conventional and unconventional to unfreeze markets, ensure adequate liquidity and ease financial conditions. Amidst heightened uncertainty, equity markets in many advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) suffered their worst week after the global financial crisis (GFC) during March 9-16, 2020. Bond yields fell sharply, most noticeably in the US where the 10-year benchmark yield fell below 1 per cent on the days of the Fed rate cut on March 03 and March 15. In currency markets, the US dollar appreciated in December as trade tensions receded and gained further on safe haven demand after the COVID-19 outbreak. Most EME currencies weakened sharply with flight to safety intensifying in late February and early March. During H2:2019-20, domestic financial markets exhibited divergent movements. A policy rate cut in October 2019 and liquidity management operations undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) enthused market sentiment but growing concerns about the domestic economic slowdown, fiscal slippages, geo-political tensions and heightened uncertainties caused by the rapid spread of COVID-19 posed significant challenges, particularly towards the close of Q4. An unscheduled meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the RBI on March 24, 26 and 27 delivered an unprecedented reduction in the policy repo rate and the announcement of several liquidity-augmenting measures briefly assuaged market fears (see Box IV.3). In the credit market, monetary policy transmission was facilitated by large surplus liquidity, long term repo operations (LTROs) targeted to reduce banks\u2019 cost of funds, simultaneous purchase and sale of securities under open market operations (special OMOs)1 and exemption from cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirements to incentivise lending to specific sectors. Equity markets scaled a new high on January 14, 2020, but turned highly volatile thereafter in sync with global markets. The Indian Rupee (INR) came under pressure due to fears sparked by the spread of 1 These operations have been commonly referred to as \u201coperation twist\u201d by the financial media drawing on the experience of the US Federal Reserve having conducted two such operations in 1961 and 2011 in a bid to lower long-term interest rates and provide a boost to the economy by making credit cheaper for businesses, industries and other borrowers. pandemic and flight to safety. In the event, however, the depreciation of INR was significantly lower than currencies of many EME peers. Money markets have remained broadly resilient reflecting the RBI\u2019s proactive liquidity management operations. During H2, the weighted average call rate (WACR) in the unsecured overnight money market has remained within the policy corridor with a downward bias (13 bps below the repo rate on an average basis) reflecting sustained surplus liquidity (Chart IV.1). The WACR spiked in the typical financial year-end phenomenon, compounded by reduced market participation because of the COVID-19 induced nation-wide lockdown. In the overnight call money segment, the weighted average rate of traded deals continued to be higher than that of reported deals.2 The share of traded deals (in terms of volume) was also higher vis-a-vis reported deals, though the latter picked up in H2 vis-\u00e0-vis H1 on: (i) increased lending by co-operative banks; and The share of the collateralised money market (triparty repo and market repo) in the overnight money market volume increased in H2:2019-20 (Chart IV.3). The dependency of banks on the call money market, however, has increased (the share of call money in total overnight transactions increased to 6 per cent during February-March 2020 from 4 per cent in January), partly reflecting the discontinuation of the daily fixed rate repo operations since February 14, 2020 as part of the revised liquidity management framework announced on February 06, 2020 (see Box IV.2). In particular, the share of triparty repo in overnight money market volumes improved due to increased lending by mutual funds (MFs) from October 2019. The change in the cut-off timing3 for applicability of net asset value (NAV) on purchase of units in liquid and overnight funds has given more leeway to asset management companies (AMCs) to deploy funds in the triparty repo segment. Accordingly, the share of 2 \u2018Traded deals\u2019 are deals negotiated directly on the NDS-Call platform whereas \u2018reported deals\u2019 are over-the-counter (OTC) deals which are reported on the NDS-Call platform after the completion of negotiation of deals. lending by MFs in triparty repo increased from 60.5 per cent in September 2019 to 64.7 per cent in October and peaked at 72.1 per cent in March. Concomitantly, borrowings by MFs reduced sharply from 9.8 per cent in September 2019 to 2.4 per cent in October, averaging only 2.2 per cent in the succeeding months. During H2:2019-20, interest rates in the collateralised overnight money market segments softened in tandem with the WACR, though the moderation was more pronounced around the time of the conduct of the third auction of the special OMOs on January 06, 2020. Overnight rates in the triparty repo and 3 The cut-off timing for computing NAV was advanced from 2:00 PM to 1:30 PM by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on September 20, 2019. market repo segments declined sharply towards end- March 2020, with the former trading close to zero as liquidity surplus increased in the wake of extreme risk-aversion gripping investors, including corporates and non-banks. The triparty repo and market repo traded below the WACR (on an average) by 36 bps and 37 bps, respectively, in H2. Interest rates on longer- term money market instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper (CPs) and treasury bills (T-Bills) of 3-month maturity moved divergently, responding to the policy rate cut in October and the build-up of surplus liquidity (Chart IV.4). CP rates experienced intermittent bouts of volatility before hardening in late-February and early-March 2020. (i) in sync with the build-up of surplus liquidity; and (ii) with the predominance of issuances by top rated issuers backed by relatively stronger parent companies. The WADR, which had firmed up by 24 bps in December 2019 reflecting credit rating concerns, increased sharply by 229 bps in March on account of contagion fears arising out of (i) COVID-19 induced financial stress; and (ii) interconnectedness in the banking system with distress in a private sector bank (Chart IV.5a). The share of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in primary issuances of CPs, which had declined immediately after the IL&FS crisis, increased in October subsequently peaking at around 35 per cent in March 2020 (Chart IV.5b). In view of the persistent liquidity surplus, banks reduced their recourse to CDs as fresh issuances declined to `1,86,954 crore during H2:2019-20 from `2,01,302 crore during H1. CP issuances also declined to `10,02,667 crore in H2 from `12,38,324 crore in H2:2018-19, mainly reflecting risk aversion. The weighted average discount rate (WADR) of CPs in the primary market generally eased up to February Monetary policy transmission was more than proportionate in the triparty repo and market repo segments, facilitated by liquidity conditions in H2:2019-20 and partly due to the year- end phenomenon as discussed earlier (Table IV.1). The risk premium (on an average) in the money market (3-month CPs over 91-day T-Bills), however, firmed up to 97 bps in H2 from 87 bps in H1, driven by fears of illiquidity and market seizure post COVID-19 induced turbulence in global and domestic financial markets. decline in the overnight index swap (OIS) rates; (ii) a fall in global crude oil prices; and (iii) softening of US treasury yields. Overall, the benchmark yield declined by 5 bps during October 2019. At the beginning of H2:2019-20, the benchmark G-sec yield softened by 4 bps on (i) market expectations of monetary policy easing; (ii) the Centre\u2019s decision to announce the auction of a new 10-year paper; and (iii) a benign inflation trajectory. Yields, however, firmed up by 8 bps after the policy announcement on October 4, 2019 as the rate cut of 25 bps fell short of market expectations. Yields continued to harden thereafter due to persistent worries about the Centre's finances, expectation of a rise in inflation prints and subdued appetite for government paper. They moderated towards end-October, however, taking cues from (i) a Yields firmed up by 7 bps on both the new benchmark (6.45% GS 2029) and the old benchmark (7.26% GS 2029) as on November 5, 2019 reflecting concerns about fiscal slippages, and the hardening of US treasury yields. At the beginning of December, both benchmark yields increased due to market sentiment turning jittery about the Centre\u2019s fiscal position. On the day of the monetary policy announcement on December 5, yields hardened by 14 bps on the new benchmark and by 18 bps on the old benchmark in the wake of (i) the MPC\u2019s decision to keep the policy rate unchanged in the face of upside risks to inflation; and Note: easing (-) / hardening (+). Sources: RBI; CCIL; F-TRAC, CCIL; FBIL; and RBI staff estimates. (ii) foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) selling heavily on a pessimistic growth outlook. Market participants, however, welcomed the Reserve Bank\u2019s decision to conduct special OMOs on December 19, which resulted in new and old benchmark yields shedding 15 bps and 13 bps, respectively.4 Yields softened at the long end, while firming up at the short-end, thereby reducing the term premium (Box IV.1). On the whole, the new and the old benchmark yields increased by 9 bps and 15 bps, respectively, in December. The term premium is the difference in yield of a long-term bond vis-a-vis a short-term bond and reflects the excess return investors demand for holding bonds of longer maturity (Swanson, 2007). The long-term interest rates at any maturity can be decomposed into two components: (i) risk-neutral rate that reflects expectations of future short- term rates; and (ii) term premium, which is indicative of investors\u2019 expectations relating to future central bank policy, inflation and growth outlook, given the expected future path of short-term interest rates. The Adrian, Crump and Moench (ACM) approach, which allows for the decomposition of yield into risk-neutral component and term premium, belongs to the regular class of dynamic term structure models (Adrian et al., 2013). These models are premised on the no-arbitrage condition5. The ACM approach uses principal components of bond yields as pricing factors. The risk-neutral rate is modelled as a linear function of these pricing factors. The longer-term yields are also obtained as linear functions of the pricing factors, with appropriate restrictions on parameters to incorporate the assumptions of the no- arbitrage, affine term-structure models. The time-varying term premium is the difference between the model-fitted yield and the risk- neutral yield. across the term structure, accounting for more than 84 per cent of the fluctuations in 10-year G-Sec yields (Table IV.1.1). While term premium accounts for only about 27-39 per cent of the fluctuations in short-term yields (1 to 2-years), around 73-61 per cent of the variation is attributed to changes in expectation on short rates. In contrast, the US term premium explains a relatively higher proportion of variation in short-term yields. Empirical analysis involves decomposition of 10-year government bond yield into expectation and term premium components following the ACM methodology (Dilip, 2019), based on monthly data on 10-year G-sec yields spanning April 2009 to February 2020. This shows that the 10-year yield has broadly tracked movements in the term premium (Chart IV.1.1). approximated as indicates that the term premium monotonically increases 4 Reflecting these operations, the 10-year G-sec yield softened cumulatively by 61 bps between December 19, 2019 and March 31, 2020. During the intervening period, however, the yields fell by as much as 69 bps. 5 Two securities that provide the same future cash flow and have the same level of risk must sell for the same price. In order to identify the determinants of the term premium in India, the 10-year term premium is regressed on its own lag, G-Sec market depth proxied by daily average turnover as proportion of GDP, international oil prices, the INR-USD spot exchange rate, systemic liquidity measured by outstanding balances under the liquidity adjustment facility as proportion of GDP, and both global and India-specific policy uncertainty represented by Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (GEPU) and Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) for India, respectively. The differenced series of all the explanatory variables is found to be stationary and the equation is estimated in an ordinary least squares (OLS) framework. Most of the estimated coefficients are statistically significant with expected signs (Table IV.1.2). The high coefficient of the lagged term indicates persistence of the term premium. The significance of the turnover and systemic liquidity variables is indicative of the important role of liquidity in higher demand for bonds and a consequent reduction in term premium. Movements in oil prices and the exchange rate of Indian Rupee (INR) also impact yields significantly \u2013 a spike in oil prices and a depreciation of the INR leads to search for safe haven assets among investors, resulting in flight to safety (panic selling) and increase in term premium. Global uncertainty (lagged) and Indian policy uncertainty, although having a positive impact, are not statistically significant. ***, **, * represent significance at 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively Note: Figures in parentheses are t-statistics based on heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC)-corrected standard errors; LB-Q is p-value of Box-Pierce-Ljung Q-statistic for the null hypothesis of no correlation up to 4 lags; and \u0394 is the difference operator.

At the beginning of January, most government papers in the 10-14-year maturity segment gained on expectations of open market purchases of long-term bonds by the Reserve Bank. Bond prices, however, fell subsequently because of lower than expected cut-off in the special OMOs. The escalation in yields continued due to rising tensions between the US and Iran and a higher than expected inflation print in January 2020. Overall, the new and the old benchmark rose by 4 bps and 7 bps, respectively, during January 2020. After the Union Budget, the market was pleasantly surprised as the government refrained from additional market borrowing for 2019-20, despite an upward revision in the projected fiscal deficit. Consequently, new and old benchmark yields fell by 10 bps and 14 bps, respectively, at the beginning of February. Yields moderated significantly on announcement of long term repo operations (LTROs) to infuse additional liquidity at the policy rate (Chart IV.6).6 Overall, the new and the old benchmark fell by 23 bps and 26 bps, respectively, during February 2020. 6 Since the announcement of LTRO on February 6, yields on 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and benchmark 10-year G-sec paper have come down by 62 bps, 71 bps, 31 bps and 37 bps, respectively, by end-March, 2020. In early-March, yields started with a softening bias of 19 bps and 13 bps in the new and old benchmarks, respectively, due to (i) unscheduled reduction of 150 bps (in two phases) by the Fed in its policy rate; and (ii) fall in crude oil prices due to Saudi Arabia increasing its supply. Yields, however, hardened thereafter due to (i) crude prices firming up in the wake of the US pledging fiscal stimulus to arrest the pandemic; (ii) a sharp depreciation of the INR triggered by COVID-19 driven panic sales by FPIs; and (iii) fears of global recession triggering a shortfall in global dollar liquidity. Yield on the new benchmark, however, fell by 15 bps with announcement of OMO purchases on March 20. The fall in yields was, however, transient as (i) the rupee depreciated to a new record low; and (ii) shrinking G-sec volumes exacerbated the fall in prices. In the backdrop of COVID-19 related stress, the RBI announced several measures on March 27, 2020. In this milieu, while the market frowned over the prospect of larger than expected government borrowings, it welcomed the Reserve Bank\u2019s policy announcement to remove investment limit for non- residents in select dated securities. Overall, the new benchmark fell by 23 bps in March. The yield curve underwent episodic shifts in H2:2019- 20, characterised by its level and slope (Chart IV.7a).7 Since the October monetary policy announcement, the average level of the yield softened by 33 bps, while the slope became steeper by 66 bps. Since the February policy announcement (up to March 31, 2020), the average level of the yield softened by 24 bps even as the slope steepened by 58 bps (Chart IV.7b). With inflation remaining range bound in October 2019, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) remained net buyers in the debt market. They turned net sellers, however, till January 2020 on concerns about government finances along with Moody\u2019s downgrading of India's credit rating (to \"negative\" from \"stable\u201d) and fears of sovereign rating downgrade by S&P Global ratings. The lower fiscal deficit projected for 2020-21 in the Union Budget buoyed sentiment and FPIs turned net buyers in February. With heightened turbulence 7 While the level is the average of all yields across maturities, the slope is represented by the difference in yield between the longest and the shortest maturity (term spread). in domestic markets following worldwide financial market meltdown, FPIs again turned net sellers in March (Chart IV.8). At the shorter end of the primary segment, yields on T-Bills softened during H2:2019-20, tracking the benchmark paper and even traded lower than the reverse repo rate in certain maturities due to surplus liquidity in the banking system (Chart IV.9). The weighted average spread of state development loans (SDLs) cut-off over the corresponding G-sec yield increased to 55 bps in H2 from 52 bps in H1:2019- 20 (Chart IV.10). The average inter-state spread on securities of 10-year tenor at 7.2 bps in H2 was higher by 3.2 bps than in H1. During H2:2019-20, the Reserve Bank conducted seven switch operations amounting to `1,24,694 crore for active debt consolidation. This partly contributed to the weighted average maturity (WAM) of outstanding stock of G-secs increasing to 10.54 years as on March 31, 2020 from 10.02 years as on September 30, 2019. As on March 31, 2020, the weighted average coupon (WAC) at 7.69 per cent was lower than 7.77 per cent at end-September 2019. started with a negative cash balance and continued to avail ways and means advances/overdraft (WMA/OD) (CMBs) were issued seven times during State Bank of India\u2019s and ICICI Bank\u2019s 5-year credit default swap (CDS) spreads increased by 174 bps and 163 bps, respectively, during H2: 2019-20. Corporate bond yields eased during H2:2019-20, largely tracking G-sec yields and reflecting surplus systemic liquidity conditions (Chart IV.11a). The AAA 5-year corporate bond yields softened by 42 bps \u2013 from 7.44 per cent at end-September 2019 to 7.02 per cent at end-March 2020. Overall, AAA 5-year yields moderated by 108 bps during 2019-20, reflecting the transmission of monetary policy actions to the corporate bond market and the impact of special OMOs and LTRO auctions during December 2019 - March 2020. The risk premia on bonds (5-year AAA corporate bonds over 5-year G-sec) issued by public sector undertakings (PSUs), financial institutions (FIs) and banks reduced by 26 bps while those issued by NBFCs reduced by 14 bps. In contrast, the risk premia on bonds issued by corporates increased by 5 bps. Reflecting the stress in the banking sector from a major private sector bank and declaration of the pandemic, Resource mobilisation through issuances of corporate bonds in the primary market at `3.1 lakh crore during October 2019-February 2020 was higher by 3.0 per cent than `3.0 lakh crore during the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart IV.11b). Almost the entire resource mobilisation in the corporate bond market (97.9 per cent) was through the private placement route. In order to provide an alternative source of financing for public sector entities at lower cost and help deepen bond markets by diversifying the investor base with increased retail participation, the Government of India (GoI) launched the Bharat Bond Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in December 2019 \u2013 the first ETF for corporate bonds in India \u2013 which mobilised `12,395 crore. Investments by FPIs in corporate bonds declined by 14.8 per cent \u2013 from `2.03 lakh crore at end-September 2019 to `1.73 lakh crore at end-March 2020. Consequently, FPIs\u2019 utilisation of the approved limit for investment in corporate bonds declined to 54.5 per cent at end-March 2020 from 66.9 8 The maturities of the CMBs were designed to alleviate the liquidity tightness caused by advance tax outflows in the second half of March 2020. per cent at end-September 2019. The average daily turnover in the corporate bond market increased to `8,460 crore during H2:2019-20 (up to March 6, 2020) from `7,097 crore during the corresponding period of Following the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, global financial markets were gripped by bearish sentiments. Heightened global turbulence The Indian equity market, which made sizable gains till mid-January 2020, recorded a sharp decline in the remaining part of H2:2019-20 tracking the deterioration in global equity market sentiment due to COVID-19. The BSE Sensex touched the 40,000 level during Q3:2019-20 but it came under intense pressure during Q4: 2019-20. Overall, the Sensex declined by 23.8 per cent during H2:2019-20 (Chart IV.13a). resulted in a significant tightening of financial rates of NBFCs over the policy repo rate increased by increased by 77, 99 and 119 bps, respectively. The policy repo rate also firmed up by 76 bps during the is attributed to both external and domestic factors. While the upheaval in global markets sparked off liquidated their positions to create a liquidity buffer in The BSE Sensex reclaimed the 40,000 level on October 30, 2019 taking positive cues from global markets amidst fresh optimism over the US-China trade negotiations and agreement on Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union (EU). The uptrend continued in November and December on the back of growth boosting measures by the Government of India (GoI), support to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code amendment and approval for a partial credit guarantee scheme for public sector banks to purchase pooled assets from NBFCs. Furthermore, positive global signals emanating from the US Fed\u2019s dovish outlook, the US-China phase one trade deal and Brexit favouring UK election outcome also brightened market sentiment. The buoyancy in the equity market continued till mid-January 2020 against the backdrop of a fall in global crude prices, recovery in industrial output in November, higher GST collection and expansion in manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) in December which pushed the Sensex to a record close of 41953 on January 14, 2020. Markets wilted, however, following the escalation of geo-political tensions between the US and Iran, a subdued domestic GDP growth outlook along with downward revision of India\u2019s growth forecast for 2019-20 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The decline got accentuated on February 1, 2020 with the Sensex plunging by 988 points (2.4 per cent) as proposals in the Union Budget 2020-21 fell short of market expectations. A V-shaped recovery, however, was witnessed on the back of a sharp fall in crude oil prices, release of robust PMI data for January 2020 and announcement of credit and liquidity enhancing measures on February 6, 2020. Subsequently, Indian equity markets retracted in line with global markets reacting to COVID-19. Growing risk aversion across the world triggered heavy sell-offs in equity markets, including in India, during March 2020. The BSE Sensex fell by 2919 points (8.2 per cent) on March 12, 2020. Market sentiment worsened the following day as market fell over 10 per cent during early hours of trading, attracting circuit breakers and suspension of trading for 45 minutes. This was followed by a statement from SEBI indicating that the fall in the Indian stock indices had been significantly lower than in many other countries and assuring market participants of suitable and appropriate actions, if required. Market rebounded, ending the day with a net gain of 1325 points (4.0 per cent), the largest ever recovery in a single day. Subsequently, however, bearish momentum returned due to (i) sharp moderation in global crude prices; (ii) reports of a spike in COVID-19 cases in India; (iii) strain on the banking sector caused by the distress of a private sector bank; and (iv) growing worries about global recession. Consequently, the Indian equity market breached the lower circuit for the second time during March 2020 with the BSE Sensex recording its biggest fall of 3,935 points (13.2 per cent) on March 23, 2020. Markets recovered thereafter amid expectations of fiscal measures by the government after the announcement of extension of regulatory deadlines and relaxation of norms for corporates and taxpayers. Subsequently, expectations of more fiscal stimulus buoyed market sentiment. Notwithstanding the announcement of comprehensive liquidity measures by the Reserve Bank including sizeable reduction in policy rates, the BSE Sensex fell marginally on March 27. Overall, the BSE Sensex registered a sharp decline of 23.0 per cent during March 2020. During H2, while MFs were net buyers to the tune of ` 38,989 crore (up to March 30), FPIs were net sellers at `5,599 crore in the Indian equity market (Chart IV.13b). FPIs, in particular, sold heavily with net sales amounting to `62,433 crore in March 2020. EME currencies, including the INR, weakened sharply in March, with the latter depreciating to a low of `76.15 on March 24, 2020. While the INR depreciated by 6.2 per cent vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar during H2:2019- 20 (end-March 2020 over end-September 2019), the decline was modest in comparison with many EME peers such as the Thai baht, the Argentine peso, the Indonesian rupiah, the Turkish lira, the South African rand, the Mexican peso, the Russian ruble, and the Brazilian real (Chart IV.14a). In the primary segment of the equity market, resource mobilisation through public issues of equity (initial public offers and right issues) remained muted at `6,176 crore during October 2019-February 2020 (although higher than `3,429 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year). In terms of the 36-currency nominal effective exchange rate (NEER), the INR depreciated by 2.9 per cent (as at end-March 2020 over average of September 2019). The INR also depreciated by 1.3 per cent in terms of the 36-currency real effective exchange rate (REER) during the same period (Table IV.2). The INR remained volatile during H2:2019-20 due to multiple factors referred to in preceding sections and the high volatility in equity markets. Portfolio investment was severely impacted. Consequently, Between September 2019 and February 2020, the appreciation of the INR in terms of the REER was modest as compared with those of the Russian ruble, the Indonesian rupiah, the Philippine peso, the Chinese yuan, the Mexican peso, and the Argentine peso (Chart IV.14b). The slowdown in credit growth was spread across all bank groups, especially private sector banks. Credit growth of public sector and foreign banks remained modest, even as there has been some uptick in credit by public sector banks in the recent period (Chart IV.16). Of the incremental credit extended by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) during the year Credit offtake during 2019-20 (up to March 13, 2020) was muted with non-food credit growth at 6.1 per cent being less than half the growth of 14.4 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Both low momentum and unfavourable base effects were at work (Chart IV.15). The seasonal decline in Q3 credit growth in 2019-20 was more pronounced than a year ago, while the offtake during Q4:2019-20 (up to March 13) has been subdued as compared with the corresponding quarters of previous two years. (March 15, 2019 to March 13, 2020), 62.6 per cent was provided by private sector banks, 36.6 per cent by public sector banks and 0.8 per cent by foreign banks. While growth (y-o-y) of personal loans accelerated marginally to 17.0 per cent in February 2020 from 16.7 per cent in February 2019, credit growth to both agriculture and industry moderated over the last five months. Although credit growth to the services sector showed an uptick in January 2020, it again weakened in February 2020 (Chart IV.17a). Credit offtake in personal loans segment accounted for the largest share (Chart IV.17b). Within the personal loan segment, credit offtake has been mainly concentrated in housing and credit card outstandings. Within industry, credit growth to beverage and tobacco accelerated, but credit flows to chemical and chemical products, cement and cement products, construction and infrastructure decelerated. Credit to basic metal and metal products, textiles, food processing and all engineering contracted in February 2020. Even as the overall non-performing assets (NPA) ratio of SCBs remained unchanged in December 2019 from end-March 2019 (Chart IV.18a), the NPA ratio in respect of industry dipped (Chart IV.18b). a: Non-SLR Investment (*up to Mar 13, 2020) Banks\u2019 investments in CPs, bonds, debentures and shares of public and private corporates \u2013 reflected in non-SLR investment \u2013 were lower during H2:2019-20 (up to March 13) than a year ago mainly due to lower investment in bonds/shares and debentures (Chart IV.19a). As a result, adjusted non-food credit growth was lower in Q4:2019-20 (up to March 13) than in Q3 (Chart IV.19b). portfolios. Banks held excess SLR of 8.4 per cent of net as compared with 6.3 per cent of NDTL at end-March With credit offtake remaining muted and non-SLR investments declining, banks augmented their SLR and lending interest rates has improved (Table IV.3). Note: Excess SLR is the average of all SLR maintained on reporting Fridays in a quarter, Source: RBI. The improvement in transmission during H2:2019-20 to banks\u2019 deposit and lending interest rates reflected the lagged impact of the previous rate cuts (110 bps during February\u2013September 2019) as also the introduction of the external benchmark system from October 1, 2019 for the pricing of new floating rate loans to select sectors, viz., retail loans and loans to micro and small enterprises (MSEs).9 During February 2019 - February 2020, the WALR on fresh rupee loans declined across bank groups, with the largest decline observed in the case of foreign banks, followed by public sector banks (Chart IV.21). The median spread10 [WALR on fresh rupee loans over 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR)] charged by private sector banks was higher than that of public sector banks, reflecting, inter alia, differences in the lending portfolio (Chart IV.22). Sector-specific WALRs in respect of sectors such as micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), credit card and other personal loans were higher than the overall WALR for both public and private sector banks. The share of loans to each of these sectors in total loans sanctioned by private sector banks was higher than that of public sector banks. The share of public sector banks in fresh rupee loans sanctioned by scheduled commercial banks was comparable to that of private sector banks during April-August 2019, even though public sector banks account for a significantly larger share in outstanding 9 Effective April 1, 2020, loans to medium enterprises have also been linked to an external benchmark. 10 Median spread of a bank group is arrived at from the spread (difference between WALR on fresh rupee loans and 1-year MCLR) of each bank within the group. credit. In comparison with private sector banks, non-performing assets of public sector banks have been higher and the capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) lower. Despite this, the share of public sector banks in total fresh rupee loans sanctioned by scheduled commercial banks increased to 52.8 per cent from a low of 39.7 per cent in August 2019 (Chart IV.23). Spreads, i.e., WALR on outstanding rupee loans over 1-year MCLR charged by scheduled commercial banks, were lowest in respect of housing loans, reflecting lower probability of default and availability of collateral, as also competition from NBFCs (Chart IV.24). Personal loans \u2013 other than housing, vehicles and education \u2013 are mostly unsecured and involve higher credit risk; hence, the spread charged was the highest for \u2018other personal loans\u2019. The spreads between lending rates in the credit market and corporate bond yields have risen sharply since January 2019, implying faster transmission of policy rate cuts to the corporate bond market as against relatively muted transmission to the credit market (Chart IV.25). their loans to various other benchmarks published by Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd (FBIL) such as CD rate, overnight index swap (OIS) rate, Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (MIBOR) and 3-month T-Bill rate. Eleven banks have linked different sectors to different benchmarks. Following the introduction of the external benchmark system in the banking sector on October 1, 2019, 36 banks \u2013 out of 62 banks from whom information was collected \u2013 adopted the policy repo rate as the external benchmark for floating rate loans to the retail and MSE sectors (Table IV.4). Six banks have linked The median spread in respect of fresh rupee loans linked to the policy repo rate (i.e., median WALR over the repo rate) was the highest for \u2018other personal loans\u2019 (Table IV.5). Among the bank-groups, the median spread charged by public sector banks for different categories of loans was lower than that charged by private sector banks. (Percentage points) @ 9 banks do not have any exposure to retail loans and MSE loans segments. Note: Figures in parentheses refer to the number of banks. Source: RBI. There are early indications of an improvement in transmission to fresh rupee loans sanctioned in respect of sectors where new floating rate loans have been linked to the external benchmark. During October 2019 - February 2020, the WALRs of domestic (public and private sector) banks declined in respect of fresh rupee loans sanctioned for housing loans by 34 bps, vehicle loans by 73 bps, education loans by 21 bps and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by 6 bps (Chart IV.26). Administered interest rates on small saving schemes set by the Government of India have implications for monetary transmission. These administered interest rates are linked to market yields on G-secs with a lag and are fixed on a quarterly basis at a spread ranging from 0-100 bps over and above G-sec yields of comparable maturities. On March 31, 2020, the Government of India sharply reduced rates of interest on all small saving schemes (except saving deposit) in the range of 70-140 bps for Q1:2020-21. Following the revision, interest rates on small saving schemes for Q1:2020-21 are broadly aligned with the prescribed formula based administered interest rates on small savings (Table IV.6). This augurs well for monetary transmission, going forward. $: Spreads for fixing small saving rates as per Government of India Press Release of February 16, 2016.

The RBI Act, 1934 amended in 2016 requires the RBI to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time, if any, in the public domain. During H2:2019-20, liquidity management operations by the RBI were conducted in line with the revised liquidity management framework announced on February 6, 2020 and guided by the need to ease liquidity constraints in the banking system and financial markets on account of COVID-19 related stress (Box IV.2). During H1 and a major part of H2:2019-20, systemic liquidity increased mainly on As announced in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies of June 6, 2019, an Internal Working Group was set up to review the liquidity management framework with a view to simplifying it and suggesting measures to clearly communicate the objectives and the toolkit for liquidity management. The Group\u2019s report was placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website on September 26, 2019 for comments from stakeholders and members of the public (RBI, 2019). Based on the feedback received, it was decided to fine-tune the erstwhile liquidity management framework. The key elements of the revised framework are set out below: Instruments of liquidity management continue to include fixed and variable rate repo/reverse repo auctions, outright open market operations (OMOs), forex swaps and other instruments as may be deployed from time to time to ensure that the system has adequate liquidity at all times. (vi) A 14-day term repo/reverse repo operation at a variable rate and conducted to coincide with the cash reserve ratio (CRR) maintenance cycle is the main liquidity management tool for managing frictional liquidity requirements. the operating procedure of monetary policy; the weighted average call rate (WACR) continues to be its operating target. (vii) The main liquidity operation would be supported by fine-tuning operations, overnight and/or longer tenor, to tide over any unanticipated liquidity changes during the reserve maintenance period. (ii) The liquidity management corridor is retained, with the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate as its upper bound (ceiling) and the fixed rate reverse repo rate as the lower bound (floor), with the policy repo rate in the middle of the corridor. (viii) In addition, the RBI will conduct, if needed, longer- term variable rate repo/reverse repo operations of more than 14 days. (iii) The width of the corridor is retained at 50 basis points \u2013 the reverse repo rate being 25 basis points below the repo rate and the MSF rate 25 basis points above the repo rate.11 (iv) The daily fixed rate repo and four 14-day term repos conducted every fortnight earlier, have been withdrawn. The Reserve Bank, however, would ensure adequate provision/absorption of liquidity as warranted by underlying and evolving market conditions \u2013 unrestricted by quantitative ceilings \u2013 at or around the policy rate. (ix) The current requirement of maintaining a minimum of 90 per cent of the prescribed CRR on a daily basis will continue.12 (x) Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) were allowed to participate directly in all overnight liquidity management operations. (xi) The margin requirements under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) would be reviewed on a periodic basis; the margin requirement for reverse repo transactions, however, would continue to be \u2018Nil\u2019. 11 The corridor width was asymmetrically widened on March 27, 2020 (see Box IV.3 for details). 12 The requirement of minimum daily CRR balance was reduced to 80 per cent on March 27, 2020 (see Box IV.3 for details). (xii) In order to improve communication on the RBI\u2019s liquidity management framework and procedures, the following measures were introduced: (a) the Press Release detailing Money Market Operations (MMO) was modified suitably to show both the daily flow impact as well as the stock impact of the RBI\u2019s liquidity operations; (b) the Reserve Bank started publishing a quantitative assessment of durable liquidity conditions of the banking system on a fortnightly basis with a lag of one fortnight; and (c) periodic consultations will be conducted with market participants and other stakeholders. account of (i) the Reserve Bank\u2019s forex operations; the government, and including recourse to WMA and OD. In order to mop up the increasing surplus liquidity, the Reserve Bank conducted variable rate reverse repo auctions of various tenors (ranging from overnight to 63 days including the main 14-day term reverse repo auction conducted on reporting Fridays since February 14, 2020) amounting to `1,96,02,726 crore in H2. Moreover, five LTROs were conducted during February and March with a view to ensuring monetary transmission. Furthermore, one targeted long term repo operation (TLTRO) was conducted in March to address the COVID-19 induced pressure on financial conditions. In view of the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse impact on global and domestic financial markets, the MPC advanced its meeting in an unprecedented move, after a careful evaluation of the current and evolving macroeconomic and financial conditions, and the outlook. The MPC voted for an unprecedented 75 bps reduction in the policy repo rate and for continuing with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Alongside, several measures were also announced on March 27, 2020 to address the stress in financial conditions and ease COVID-19 related liquidity constraints (Box IV.3). Reserve Bank to conduct auctions of targeted long-term repos of up to three years tenor of appropriate sizes for a total amount of up to `1,00,000 crore at a floating rate linked to the policy repo rate. Liquidity availed by banks under TLTROs should be deployed in investment grade corporate bonds, commercial paper, and non-convertible debentures over and above the outstanding level of their investments in these bonds as on March 27, 2020. (i) CRR requirement of banks was reduced by 100 bps from 4.0 per cent of NDTL to 3.0 per cent effective fortnight beginning March 28, 2020, which would augment primary liquidity in the banking system by about `1,37,000 crore. This dispensation will be available for a period of one year ending March 26, 2021. (ii) The minimum daily CRR balance requirement was reduced from 90 per cent to 80 per cent effective from the first day of the fortnight beginning March 28, 2020. This dispensation will be available up to June 26, 2020. In view of the exceptionally high volatility in domestic financial markets and to provide comfort to the banking system, banks\u2019 limit for borrowing overnight under the MSF by dipping into their Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) was raised to 3 per cent of NDTL from 2 per cent. This measure will allow the banking system to avail an additional `1,37,000 crore of liquidity under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) window at the reduced MSF rate of 4.65 per cent and will be applicable up to June 30, 2020. (i) The policy repo rate under the LAF was reduced by 75 basis points to 4.40 per cent from 5.15 per cent with immediate effect. Accordingly, the MSF rate and the Bank Rate were reduced to 4.65 per cent from 5.40 per cent. cent. The purpose of this measure was to make it relatively unattractive for banks to passively deposit funds with the RBI; instead, these funds should be deployed for on-lending to productive sectors of the economy. (iii) Thus, the reverse repo rate is now 40 bps lower than the policy repo rate while the MSF rate continues to be 25 bps above the policy repo rate. (ii) In view of persistent excess liquidity, the existing LAF corridor was widened asymmetrically to 65 bps from 50 bps. Accordingly, the reverse repo rate was reduced by 90 bps from 4.90 per cent to 4.00 per The leakage of currency from the system during H2:2019-20 was more than offset by Reserve Bank\u2019s forex operations and drawdown of government cash balances, thereby augmenting liquidity in the banking system (Chart IV.27). The surplus liquidity was absorbed through reverse repo operations under the LAF. The increase in currency in circulation (CiC) of `2.61 lakh crore in H2 was more than five-fold than that of `49,378 crore in H1:2019-20 and higher than `2.11 lakh crore in H2:2018-19. As a result, growth in CiC at 11.9 per cent during H2:2019-20 was higher Surplus liquidity conditions persisted in Q3:2019- 20 as daily net liquidity absorption under the LAF progressively increased from `1.99 lakh crore in October to `2.41 lakh crore in November and further to `2.61 lakh crore in December 2019. Expecting the continuance of surplus liquidity, the Reserve Bank conducted four longer term reverse repo auctions in November \u2013 two of 21-days and one each of 42- days and 35-days tenor \u2013 thereby absorbing `78,934 crore. During Q3, the Reserve Bank\u2019s forex operations (`1.25 lakh crore) and drawdown of GoI cash balances (`45,184 crore) augmented systemic liquidity. The Reserve Bank also conducted four special OMOs during December and January (December 23 and 30, 2019 and January 6 and 23, 2020), which augmented net banking system liquidity by `11,724 crore.13 USD 2.71 billion (Chart IV.28). Furthermore, in view of hardening yields and widening spreads in certain market segments symptomatic of stressed financial conditions (see Chart IV.12), three open market purchase operations were conducted on March 20, 24 and 26, 2020, thereby injecting `40,000 crore cumulatively. In Q4, average daily surplus liquidity further increased to `3.18 lakh crore in January as the Government continued to avail WMA/OD for the entire month, but moderated to `2.98 lakh crore in February as GoI\u2019s cash balance turned positive in the second half of the month, due to issuance of CMBs as discussed earlier (see IV.1.2 for details). In March, average daily net absorption under the LAF amounted to `3.02 lakh crore. Taking into consideration the increased demand for US dollars amidst flight to safety triggered by extremely volatile global financial markets, the Reserve Bank conducted two 6-month US Dollar/INR sell/buy swap auction on March 16 and March 23, 2020, which cumulatively provided dollar liquidity of With a view to reinforcing monetary transmission and augmenting credit flows to productive sectors, the Reserve Bank conducted five long term repo operations (LTRO) at fixed repo rate (one of one-year and four of three-year tenors) between February 17 and March 18, 2020, which infused durable liquidity amounting to `1.25 lakh crore into the system with additional `75,000 crore in the pipeline. The LTROs provided banks with durable liquidity at reasonable cost (fixed repo rate) relative to prevailing market rates. Moreover, a TLTRO auction of 3-year maturity held on March 27, 2020 also augmented durable liquidity by `25,009 crore.14 Thus, total durable 13 While long-term paper amounting to `40,000 crore was purchased through these auctions, sale of short-term securities amounted to `28,276 crore. 14 Two more TLTRO auctions of 3-year maturity were conducted on April 3 and April 9, respectively, which cumulatively augmented durable liquidity by `50,032 crore. Summing up, currency expansion, Reserve Bank\u2019s forex operations and government spending were the key liquidity drivers in the banking system during H2:2019-20 (Chart IV.30). liquidity (including forex purchases, OMOs, LTROs and TLTRO) amounting to `4,49,326 crore was injected in H2:2019-20 as compared with `1,26,514 crore in H1 (Chart IV.29). liquidity conditions, fine-tuning Given surplus operations through variable rate reverse repo auctions with maturity ranging from overnight to 3 days were extensively used for absorbing liquidity till February 14, 2020. As a pre-emptive measure to tide over any frictional liquidity requirements caused by dislocations due to COVID-19, two fine-tuning variable rate repo auctions of 16-day maturity were conducted on March 23 and March 24, 2020 injecting `77,745 crore cumulatively (Table IV.7). To address any additional demand for liquidity and provide flexibility to the banking system in its liquidity management towards the year-end, one fine-tuning variable rate repo auction of 12-days maturity was conducted on March 26 injecting `11,772 crore.15 As a special case, SPDs were allowed to participate in these auctions along with other eligible participants. 15 Two other fine-tuning operations through variable rate repo auctions were held \u2013 for ` 25,000 crore each of 7-days and 3-days maturity on March 13 and March 31, respectively \u2013 which did not elicit any response from the market. getting reflected in bond market yields. Credit Domestic financial markets remain vulnerable to global developments, deepening of the growth slowdown in India and rising concerns about COVID-19. Despite the weak domestic growth outlook, Indian equity markets scaled new highs, before turning highly volatile in early-March in tandem with global equity markets. The outlook is characterised by heightened uncertainty with capital outflows continuing and exerting pressures on the INR. This outlook is uncertain and is increasingly growth is likely to remain modest, reflecting weak demand and risk aversion. Going forward, liquidity conditions would be managed under the revised long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Better transmission of remain a priority. Economic activity remained subdued across major advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs). Though some transitory signs of stabilisation were evident in early 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 and its rapid spread over a large number of countries has clouded the near-term outlook. Monetary policy has remained highly accommodative as most central banks across the world resorted to massive easing through both conventional and unconventional measures. Global financial markets, which remained buoyant on risk-on sentiments in Q4:2019, slumped on sell-off pressures triggered by intensifying COVID-19 disruptions. Global economic activity remained subdued during the major part of H2:2019. In January 2020, the IMF estimated global GDP growth at 2.9 per cent for 2019, the lowest since the global financial crisis (GFC). Early into 2020, signs of stabilisation seemed to appear in the form of de-escalating trade tensions between the US and China and receding possibility of a hard Brexit. A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019 delivered a cataclysmic shock to these green shoots and changed the world. The WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 and christened the novel coronavirus as COVID-19 on February 11, 2020. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared it a pandemic \u2013 \u201cthe first pandemic caused by a corona virus\u201d1. At the time of going to press, more than 12 lakh people were infected around the world with more than 67,000 deaths2. In the G-20 Ministerial Call on the Coronavirus Emergency on March 23, 2020 the Managing Director, IMF formally informed that the global economy had entered into recession in 2020. to 6.6 million in the week ended March 28, 2020, the highest since the series began in 1967. Crude oil prices plummeted in March due to price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia over disagreement on production cuts. Prices of other global commodities ebbed on fears of weakening global demand. Prices of precious metals initially rallied on safe haven demand as investors resorted to flight to safety, but they declined in the second week of March as investors preferred to hold cash. Central banks across major advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) switched to highly accommodative mode, with most of them resorting to rate cuts in unscheduled meetings. Central banks also announced several liquidity measures and regulatory relaxations in the face of tightening financial conditions. Fiscal authorities across the world have launched stimuli in the range of 0.8-16.0 per cent of their GDP. Besides direct support, measures also include tax deferment and credit guarantee. Amongst the early incoming data, GDP of Singapore shrank by 10.6 per cent in Q1:2020. In the US, jobless claims surged to a peak as the number of people filling for unemployment insurance claims jumped In the US, GDP grew by 2.1 per cent in Q4:2019 \u2013 the same pace as in the previous quarter. Overall GDP growth for 2019 decelerated to its slowest pace in three years amidst continuing weakness in business investment and exports (Table V.1). In Q1:2020, In Q1:2020, the rapid spread of COVID-19 infections in Italy, Spain and other European countries is likely to impact manufacturing and services sectors. The ECB has projected GDP growth to decline to 0.8 per cent for 2020 under its baseline scenario assumption that the impact of virus would get contained in next few months and growth would normalise in H2:2020. The Japanese economy contracted sharply in Q4 as private consumption slumped in the wake of October\u2019s sales tax hike. The slowdown in factory activity due to a string of typhoons and sluggish external demand added further pressure on domestic activity. In Q1:2020, the increased number of infections, including across the East Asian regions, threaten to disrupt economic activity severely. industrial production growth stalled in February after contracting for the fifth consecutive month in January and the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) of the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) contracted in March after improving marginally in January-February. Retail sales have also softened since January. Although labour market remained strong in February as reflected in better than expected US jobs report, number of people filling jobless claims in the US for the week ended March 28 rose to a record level of 6.6 million \u2013 the highest since the series began in 1967. Economic activity in the Euro area decelerated markedly in Q4:2019 as a pronounced downturn in industrial activity and subdued consumer demand weighed on overall economic performance. GDP growth contracted in France and Italy in Q4:2019 on waning consumer confidence, and stagnated in Germany on muted private and government spending. In the UK, GDP growth stagnated in Q4, after rebounding in Q3. Positive contributions from the services and construction sectors were offset by a decline in manufacturing output. Political uncertainty due to the Brexit deadline in October and general election in December appeared to have slowed activity in the final quarter. In Q1:2020, industrial production contracted and retail sales remained subdued. Risks emanating from COVID-19 may undermine the outlook for Q1. Sluggish growth across major EMEs in Q4:2019 was overwhelmed by the outbreak of COVID-19; suddenly, the downside risks to growth became acute (Box V.1). The Chinese economy had managed to maintain the pace of GDP growth in Q4:2019 at the momentum secured in Q3 only to be overtaken in Q1:2020 by COVID-19. Caixin\u2019s manufacturing PMI plunged to 40.3 in February \u2013 the lowest since the survey began in April 2004 \u2013 with new orders and employment falling the most on enforced shutdowns in many regions. However, it rebounded in March to 50.1 suggesting slight expansion in manufacturing activity as output improved marginally relative to February\u2019s disruptions. Industrial production contracted sharply In the initial weeks of February, most forecasts of global output loss due to COVID-19 were in terms of the outbreak being confined to China and being brought under control by March/June. It was, however, acknowledged that even in the limited scenario, the economic impact would be significant as China is a much larger player \u2013 both in terms of economic size and its role in global value chains \u2013 now than in 2003, the period of the SARS epidemic (Chart V.1.1). Owing to extended lunar new year holidays as also government-imposed factory shutdowns and travel restrictions in a number of regions, China\u2019s manufacturing/ services activity declined sharply in February. In the latter part of February, a rapid surge of infections and fatalities around the world began to surface, even as the spread of the virus in China began to plateau. Lockdowns were/have been imposed in most countries. Travel bans have created distress for airlines, tourism and hospitality industries. Notes: 1. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates of March considered baseline scenario of COVID-19 peaking in China in Q1:2020 and limited spread to other regions. Extreme scenario considered a longer-lasting and more intensive COVID-19 outbreak spreading to most regions. The estimated impact is in terms of percentage point of global GDP growth. In the commodity and financial markets, crude oil prices have been on a downward spiral; with West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude prices crashing below US$ 20 per barrel on March 30, 2020. Equity markets have suffered major losses, while gold, fixed income assets \u2013 mainly government debt, and the US dollar gained ground due to safe haven demand, but later corrected significantly on profit-booking and flight to cash (refer to Chart V.4, and Charts V.6-8). With the pandemic still looming, the estimates of the downward drag on global growth are being continuously revised. The consensus, however, is that there will be a recession in 2020 (Chart V.1.2). Multilateral institutions, governments and central banks are taking swift action to tackle the pandemic and its consequences (Table V.1.1.) Sources: Websites of central banks; and www.centralbanking.com The key existential question is: Will the worldwide effort contain the mortality and morbidity as also the macroeconomic consequences of COVID-19? to its lowest level in 30 years and retail sales registered its first ever decline in January-February 2020. The imposition of shipping restrictions and order cancellations as part of virus containment measures weighed heavily on exports and supply chains. Wide- ranging policy support \u2013 both fiscal and monetary and health services \u2013 is expected to mitigate the slowdown in the second half of 2020. Among the other BRICS countries, economic activity in Russia was sustained in H2:2019 as reflected in improved retail sales, tight labour markets and falling inflation. Increased government spending on national projects and lower interest rates appeared to have supported activity in Q4:2019. Incoming data for Q1:2020 suggest that the economy has maintained the pace so far as retail sales have been increasing since January, while industrial production improved in February after a moderation in January. However, a sharp fall in crude oil prices due to the tensions with Saudi Arabia poses a large downside risk. The Brazilian economy ended the year on a relatively weak note due to a fall in construction and mining activity and private consumption. During Q1:2020, incoming data point to a slowdown in both industrial production and retail sales, while deteriorating external sector dynamics on increasing COVID-19 uncertainty is further expected to pull down the growth, going ahead. The South African economy entered a technical recession in Q4 \u2013 second time in two years \u2013 as agriculture, transport and construction activities declined sharply amidst frequent power outages. Moreover, falling export growth due to supply constraints, and weak fixed investment and government spending added further downward pressures. In activity maintained momentum: GDP growth in Q4:2019 was at the same pace as in Q3. Positive contribution from the external sector due to falling imports was offset by weak fixed monetary policy are expected to provide a boost to economic activity, downside risks emerging from the OECD economies, composite leading indicators (CLIs) \u2013 available till December \u2013 suggested a firming up of growth momentum across major AEs and EMEs in the final months of 2019 (Chart V.1b). pandemic may impact the momentum, going ahead. In Thailand, GDP growth in Q4 registered a five-year low in y-o-y terms, pulled down by weak domestic and drought. The growth outlook for Q1 remains bleak as tourism is adversely impacted by COVID-19. The slowdown in global trade got entrenched in H2:2019 as the mild recovery in trade volume of AEs during Q3:2019 turned out to be short-lived, with contraction setting in again in Q4:2019. EMEs dragged down global trade in all four quarters of 2019 (Chart V.2a). The global composite PMI plunged in February- March, reversing the uptrend that occurred between October 2019 and January 2020. The index reached and employment rose faster on the back of strong business optimism. However, it fell sharply since February, even falling to 133-month low level of activity declined considerably amidst disruptions Forward-looking indicators suggest that world trade growth is likely to remain weak in Q1:2020 due to supply and demand disruptions caused by COVID-19. The WTO\u2019s Goods Trade Barometer remained below trend, pulled down by contraction in constituent indices pertaining to agricultural raw materials and container shipping. The Baltic Dry Index, which measures the shipping costs for a wide variety of bulk commodities such as coal, iron ore and grain, continues to show weakness (Chart V.2b). caused by COVID-19 (Chart V.1a). Among the major prices, led by demand contractions amidst COVID-19 Global commodity prices remained largely supported in Q4:2019 as uncertainty related to trade eased and Crude oil prices remained largely supported in the US dollar weakened. However, global headwinds relating to US-Iran conflict in early January followed before tumbling towards the end of January. A spike by the outbreak of COVID-19 exerted downward to US$ 69 per barrel on January 6, 2020 followed escalation of US-Iran tensions, but a correction ensued declined by 20.5 per cent between October 2019 and as tensions eased. From end-January, oil prices came slowdown caused by COVID-19, plummeting by almost Agriculture Organisation (FAO) increased by 1.8 per 30 per cent on March 9, 2020. Increased supplies by Saudi Arabia following failure to strike an agreement food prices firmed up beginning October 2019 to a on production cuts with Russia, sparked fears of price five-year high in December and continued to firm up war (Chart V.3b). On March 30, 2020, WTI crude prices in January 2020 on the back of rising vegetable oil, slid below US$ 20 per barrel as COVID-19 widened its and expectations of tightening world supplies. The Base metal prices, measured by Bloomberg\u2019s base metal food price index slid in February on a sharp fall in the index, fell by 17.9 per cent between October 2019 price of vegetable oil, which subsequently softened demand slowdown. Sugar and dairy prices have risen deal between the US and China gave way to bearish and robust demand. In March, the index fell further, sentiments from mid-January 2020. The spiralling of infected cases beyond Chinese borders and concerns about the global downturn intensified deflationary pressures pushing metal prices down (Chart V.4). Inflation remained broadly contained in major AEs, but picked up in key EMEs on firming food prices. In Gold prices remained elevated in January-February, with prices rallying on safe haven demand amidst increased concerns over the global growth outlook (Box V.2). From mid-March, however, gold prices declined, falling below the US$ 1500 per troy ounce mark, on large sell-offs as investors fled to cash to compensate losses in other markets amidst heightened volatility. the US, CPI inflation picked up modestly beginning October on rising prices of health services and food, though eased marginally in February on falling travel expenditure (PCE) deflator \u2013 the Fed\u2019s preferred measure \u2013 inflation remained below the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target. In the Euro area too, inflation remained As a financial asset, gold\u2019s appeal typically rises in times of financial turmoil. Recently, growing concerns about a deep global slowdown due to COVID-19 boosted its safe haven demand. On year to date basis, gold prices shot up by 11 per cent (till March 09, 2020) on top of an 18 per cent increase in 2019 (Chart V.2.1a). Gold futures also traded higher (Chart V.2. 1b). Through 2019, risk-off sentiments kept the overall appetite for gold strong as also evident in high exchange traded fund inflows, large purchases by central banks and increased COMEX net long positions. This upside to gold prices extended into 2020 up to mid- March as extreme risk aversion caused by COVID-19 sparked off sustained gold sales as it too lost allure amid heightened volatility, and gave way to an overriding preference to hold cash. This pulled down gold prices by 12 per cent between March 9 and 19, 2020. However, with subsequent recovery towards the end of March 2020, gold prices increased by 3.9 per cent on year to date basis (up to March 31, 2020). The empirical literature identifies a host of factors, viz., oil prices, global liquidity conditions, exchange rate, inflation, bond yields, stock prices and economic policy uncertainty as major drivers of gold prices. Investors consider gold as a tool for portfolio diversification, as it enables hedges The dynamics of gold prices are examined on a Johansen\u2019s long-run cointegration relationship. Gold prices (LGOLD), the US general price index (LCPIUS) and the US real exchange rate (LREERUS) are of one order of integration or I(1) and hence a long-run relationship between them could exist, as borne out by tests for cointegration. The estimated long-run equation is as follows: to estimate Equation (1) is augmented with the error correction term to capture the short-run dynamics of gold prices, while controlling for exogenous factors, viz., global economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index4, flight to safety proxied by changes in the Standard and Poor\u2019s Index of US equity markets (\u0394LS&P) and changes in Brent spot prices (\u0394LOIL). The empirical analysis used monthly data for the period spanning January 2005 to December 2019. All the data, barring LCPIUS, were sourced from Bloomberg. LCPIUS was sourced from the website of the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. 4 Davis, Steven J. (2016), \u201cAn Index of Global Economic Policy Uncertainty,\u201d Macroeconomic Review, October. The short-run equation was estimated by adjusting for ARCH effects, since the errors were found to be heteroscedastic. Time dummies (October 2008 and May 2006) representing the periods of excessive intra-month volatility in gold prices were included (Table V.1.1). The error correction term turned out to be statistically significant with the correct negative sign. This indicates the return of the gold price to its long-run relationship and that the estimated model is stable. \u0394LREERUS was found to be significant at one lag with a negative sign. This suggests that a depreciation in the US dollar would make gold cheaper outside the US dollar area leading to higher demand for gold and increase in gold prices in US dollar terms. \u0394LCPIUS has negative relationship with gold prices in the short-run, which implies that a higher inflation in the US could dampen the demand for gold and reduce its price. This could be attributed to a host of factors, viz., central bank policies, investors\u2019 preference to hold cash ahead of a recession and uncertainty perturbing the long- run relationship. The other variables, viz., economic and political uncertainty, stock index and crude oil prices had their expected signs and were statistically significant. In sum, the empirical findings suggest that a rise in crude oil prices and a depreciation of the US dollar in the short- run lead to increase in gold prices. On the other hand, gold prices fall with a rise in equity prices. Gold prices also move in tandem with heightened economic policy uncertainty, thereby indicating the safe haven feature of the asset.

Although energy and food inflation firmed up, measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted. Moreover, CPI inflation eased further in March on sharp decline in energy prices. In Japan, CPI inflation remained at a low level and edged down further in February on soft food prices and declining fuel prices (Chart V.5a). got accentuated in January due to seasonal demand moderated slightly in February on easing non-food prices. In Brazil, CPI inflation has been rising since especially meat and transport prices, although falling food and beverages prices provided some relief in Inflation edged up across major EMEs, except Russia. China experienced persisting inflationary pressures on account of surging pork prices, which February. In South Africa, inflation increased for the third consecutive month in February, primarily driven and health services. CPI inflation eased in Russia, falling below the 4 per cent target from October 2019. Subdued external demand, falling food prices amidst excess supply and strong base effect related to the VAT rate hike a year ago exacerbated the downtrend. However, it increased marginally in March on firming services and non-food prices (Chart V.5b). In 2019, monetary policy was said5 to have been the most accommodative across the world since the GFC. Most AEs as also some EMEs, kept their policy rate on hold in Q4:2019, but resorted to massive easing through both conventional and unconventional measures with the outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 in Q1:2020. needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy, including commercial mortgage-backed securities in its purchase programme, lowering of the interest rate on primary credit to the same level as the top of the target range of the Federal Funds rate, allowing banks to use capital and liquidity buffers for lending, and reducing the reserve requirement to zero. The Fed has also launched dedicated facilities for financing support to commercial paper, primary dealers and money market mutual funds, while reviving the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility from the crisis time. The Fed would also be supporting credit to large employers, under new programmes. Besides, the Fed has also expanded dollar liquidity swap lines with other central banks and set up a temporary repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities. The US Fed, which had paused in two consecutive FOMC meetings in December 2019 and January 2020, resorted to emergency rate cuts \u2013 50 bps on March 3 and 100 bps on March 15 (Chart V.6a). With these sharp reductions, the Fed brought down the target range for the Federal Funds rate to the same level as during the GFC. The Fed has also announced several other measures such as asset purchases The European Central Bank (ECB), has not changed key rates since a 10 bps reduction in deposit rate announced in its September 2019 meeting. In its March 2020 meeting, however, the ECB announced an additional 120 billion of net asset purchases, temporary longer-term refinancing operations and more favourable terms and quantum for the targeted 5 See https://blogs.imf.org/2020/01/28/a-call-for-vigilance-after-a-strong-year- for-risky-assets/.

The ECB also announced a new Purchase Programme (PEPP) under which private and public sector securities would be purchased until end- 2020 with flexibility on purchase flows over time, and across asset classes and jurisdictions, including Greek government bonds. The ECB also included non-financial commercial paper as eligible assets for its corporate sector purchase programme, and eased collateral requirements for its refinancing operations. balances of banks. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand undertook an emergency rate cut of 75 bps in March, pushing the policy rate to a new low of 0.25 per cent, besides announcing purchases under open market operations and other measures to support smooth functioning of the market. The Bank of Korea, on a pause since November 2019, undertook an emergency rate cut of 50 bps in March 2020 and announced other measures to stabilise economic and financial conditions. The Bank of England (BoE), which was on a pause after raising the Bank rate in August 2018, undertook two out-of-turn rate cuts in March \u2013 of 50 bps and 15 bps \u2013 thereby reducing the Bank rate to an all-time low of 0.1 per cent. The BoE also announced additional asset purchases of \u00a3200 billion to be completed quickly in 2020. The BoE also announced macro- prudential relaxations and other incentives in order to support the economy with funds to tackle COVID-19 repercussions. The Bank of Canada (BoC), which was on a pause after October 2018, cut its policy rate by a cumulative 150 bps in March 2020, in three steps of 50 bps each to 0.25 per cent, to provide support to the Canadian financial system and the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The BoC has also introduced new liquidity support measures, including launching a quantitative easing programme. The Bank of Japan announced an enhancement of monetary easing in March 2020. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which was on a pause from November 2019 after having reduced the cash rate to an all-time low in October, reduced the cash rate by 25 bps each on two occasions in March to a new low of 0.25 per cent. The RBA also undertook additional measures such as yield curve control to be achieved through bond purchases, term funding facility and remuneration of exchange settlement Riksbank was one of the few central banks that raised policy rates in 2019 with a hike of 25 bps in December 2019, thereby moving out of negative policy rate territory. In an emergency monetary policy meeting in March, however, the Riksbank announced additional asset purchases of SEK 300 billion, besides offering increased funding to banks on favourable terms and other measures. EMEs have also undertaken monetary easing and announced other liquidity support measures. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) had effected a 5 bps cut in the one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) in November and followed it up with another 10 bps reduction in February 2020. The PBoC also injected about 1.2 trillion Chinese yuan of liquidity when markets opened on February 3 after an extended lunar new year break. It also announced a low-cost refinancing facility aimed at small and medium sized enterprises. In March, the PBoC lowered the reserve ratios for certain categories of banks and lowered the 7-day reverse repo rate by 20 bps. Other BRICS central banks remained in accommodative mode. The central bank of Brazil, which has been following \u2018stimulative monetary policy\u2019 and reducing the Selic rate since August 2019, cut this rate further by 50 bps each on two occasions in Q4:2019, and followed up with a 25 bps cut in February and a 50 bps cut in March. The Bank has also offered regulatory relaxations and other liquidity support facilities.

Bank of Russia, which had been reducing its policy rate in every policy meeting since June 2019, cut it by 25 bps each in its October, December and February meetings, but maintained a pause in the March meeting. The South African Reserve Bank, which had cut policy rate in July 2019 and had since maintained a pause, reduced its repo rate by 25 bps in January 2020 and a further 100 bps in March 2020 as the South African economy was expected to contract in 2020, having entered a recession in H2:2019 while inflation remained moderate (Chart V.6b). The central bank of Turkey, which embarked on policy accommodation in July 2019, cumulatively cut the policy rate by 675 bps on five occasions since October 2019. Banco de M\u00e9xico, which cut its policy rate by 25 bps in each of its meeting since August 2019 as growth stagnated for several quarters, effected a 50 bps cut in March. The central bank of Philippines and Bank Indonesia, which were on pause after cutting rates in September, cut their policy rates by 25 bps each in February 2020, and by 50 bps and 25 bps, respectively, in March to support growth. Other central banks that cut rates on COVID-19 concerns include, inter alia, the Bank of Thailand, the Bank Negara Malaysia and the Central Bank of Chile. Global financial markets witnessed firming up of risk- on sentiment in Q4:2019 as a host of factors that had kept markets on edge \u2013 notably, the US-China trade tensions; and uncertainty regarding Brexit \u2013 receded to an extent. There was a bout of risk-off sentiment in early January due to geopolitical tensions emanating from the US-Iran conflict. However, calm quickly returned but when China declared on January 20 that there had been cases of human to human transmission of the novel coronavirus, sentiments turned extremely volatile, exacerbated by disagreement on oil production cuts between OPEC and Russia in March. In the same week, the WHO categorised the COVID-19 as a pandemic, which led to a tailspin in the markets and financing conditions tightened worldwide. Among AEs, US equities were on a continuous uptrend in Q4:2019, as the US Fed cut rates in October while the unemployment level in the US remained at a historic low. Positive news on the trade front \u2013 passing of the US-Mexico-Canada agreement by the House of Representatives and the announcement of the phase one agreement between the US and China \u2013 buoyed markets. In January, escalation of tension with Iran pulled down equities for a brief period. Another slide occurred after the outbreak of COVID-19. As China took strong action to restrict the limit and impact of COVID-19, US equities began rising again, reaching all- time highs in the third week of February. Immediately thereafter, with the rapid spread of COVID-19 to Italy, South Korea and Iran, sentiments worsened and the US indices registered their worst weekly performance since the GFC. The US Fed issued a statement that it stood ready to support the economy and announced an out-of-turn rate cut, which led to a recovery in the market for a couple of days. After the fallout between Russia and Saudi Arabia on crude oil and COVID-19 being declared a pandemic, the US equity market hit circuit breakers on two days in one week (March 9 and 12) \u2013 March 12 was the worst trading day since the Black Monday crash of October 19, 1987. The markets hit a circuit breaker again on March 16, just after the second emergency rate cut by the Fed. The marginal recovery in the latter part of March was on account of economic stimulus package worth about US$ 2 trillion being signed into law. In the UK and the Euro area, equity markets gained strength from December onwards with the UK general elections and certainty about Brexit. In Japan, stocks rose in Q4:2019 on expectation of higher profitability with favourable currency movement even as overall growth remained sluggish. With the COVID-19 outbreak, however, their indices crashed in sync with stock markets worldwide. Stock markets in EMEs mirrored this pattern. Driven by risk-on sentiments, stock markets in most EMEs registered handsome gains in Q4:2019 (Chart V.7). In Q1:2020, EME stock markets have been driven mainly by concerns about COVID-19, with additional headwinds arising from the crude oil price war in March. Chinese stocks fell most on February 3 after an extended lunar break. Other EME markets suffered sharper slides with frequent trading curbs in the second week of March. Bond yields firmed up across major AEs in the wake of risk-on sentiments, as also on improving global growth outlook and receding trade tensions in Q4:2019. With COVID-19, yields dipped on strong safe haven demand. In the US, the 10-year yield fell to historic lows in the fourth week of February as stock markets fell and demand for government bonds soared exemplifying flight to quality with the rapid spread of COVID-19 outside China and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warning of increased risk to US residents. Yields dived below one per cent after the first emergency rate cut by the Fed, reaching an all-time low on March 9, before recovering marginally (Chart V.8a). (Chart V.8b). Most emerging market currencies, which had strengthened due to risk-on sentiment towards end-2019, weakened sharply with flight to safety in Similar rallies were seen in bonds in other AEs, with yields reaching new lows in the UK and the Euro area. Bond yields across AEs continued to dip up to March 9, but increased sharply thereafter, with 10-year Japanese yields turning positive. Yields in EMEs, in general, softened in Q4:2019 with search for yield driving rates down. However, yields broadly remained range-bound up to February, but sharp risk- off sentiment in March led to a rout and yields across these economies rose sharply. increased by 3.6 per cent in Q4:2019 and declined by In sum, global growth prospects have been rendered extremely weak. Inflation in AEs remains benign, and a sharp decline in non-food commodity prices has imparted a further downward bias. Inflation concerns, In currency markets, the US dollar weakened against major currencies, with the policy rate reduction by the Fed in October and guidance that it would pause. The dollar recovered in January with receding of trade tensions. With COVID-19, safe haven demand pushed up the dollar index further. However, with the virus spreading to the US and rising fatalities, as well as the rate cut by the Fed, the dollar weakened in early March however, remain in some EMEs although considerable uncertainty clouds the inflation outlook in the context of COVID-19. Global financial markets have become extremely volatile. Quick and coordinated actions by monetary authorities and governments have been taken, but there is little evidence as yet that they could mitigate the risks to the global economy from amplifying. ", "file13": "The macroeconomic setting for the conduct of monetary policy has undergone significant shifts as domestic activity lost speed in 2018-19 and inflation conditions turned unusually benign under the impact of deflationary food prices. Going forward, economic activity is expected to recover in 2019-20. Headline CPI inflation is projected to move up from its recent lows as the favourable base effects dissipate but remain below the target of 4 per cent in 2019-20. Global economic activity and trade have been shedding momentum and downside risks to the outlook have increased. Since the release of the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of October 2018, the macroeconomic setting for the conduct of monetary policy has undergone significant shifts. After averaging close to 8 per cent through Q3:2017-18 to Q1:2018-19, domestic economic activity lost speed. The February 2019 release of the Central Statistics Office (CSO), read in conjunction with high frequency indicators, suggests that the economy could have encountered a soft patch. At the same time, some of the forward-looking surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) indicate that consumer confidence has improved and business expectations remain optimistic. Moreover, aggregate flow of funds to the commercial sector from banks and non-banks remains robust, led by strong growth in bank credit. Inflation conditions have turned unusually benign under the impact of deflationary food prices. While total financial flows from banking and non-banking sources have improved, a durable strengthening of investment demand is yet to take hold. Turning to the international environment, global activity and trade have been shedding momentum and downside risks to the outlook have increased. Tracking other commodity prices, international crude oil prices have declined sharply from their October highs, though they continue to be volatile. Protracted trade tensions and concerns over Brexit have eroded business and consumer confidence in major countries/ regions. In response to these evolving developments, monetary policy authorities across the world have stepped back from further tightening/normalisation, and more recently a more accommodative stance is evident from some central banks. During October 2018-February 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met thrice in accordance with its bi-monthly schedule. The MPC maintained status quo on the policy repo rate in its October 2018 meeting (with a majority of 5-1) but switched stance from neutral to calibrated tightening. The MPC\u2019s decision was conditioned by risks to inflation from volatile crude oil prices; rising input costs; fiscal slippage concerns; uncertainty about the impact of minimum support prices (MSPs); the staggered impact of the likely increase in house rent allowances by the states; and, the virtual closing of the output gap. In its December 2018 meeting, the MPC left the policy rate unchanged and retained the stance of calibrated tightening, although inflation projections were revised downwards. In its February 2019 meeting, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) by a majority of 4-2 and was unanimous in voting for switching its stance to neutral from calibrated tightening. This decision was prompted by the continuous easing of headline inflation, a stable crude oil price outlook and some moderation in cost pressures. Headline inflation was projected to remain below the target of 4 per cent over the coming four quarters, which opened up space for easing. The diversity in the MPC\u2019s voting pattern observed during October 2018-February 2019 was also seen in some other central banks (Table I.1), reflecting differences in individual members\u2019 assessments and expectations, and policy preferences. Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. Chapters III analyse macroeconomic developments during October 2018-March 2019 and explain the deviations of inflation and growth outcomes from staff\u2019s projections. Turning to the outlook, the evolution of key macroeconomic and financial variables over the past six months warrants revisions in the baseline assumptions (Table I.2). First, international crude oil prices have declined sharply from their October 2018 level, even though they have rebounded in recent months. Crude oil prices (Indian basket) fell from their peak of around US$ 85 a barrel in early October 2018 to a low of around US$ 52 at end-December on the back of higher supplies and a slowdown in global demand. Prices edged higher to average around US$ 67 during March, after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia cut production January 2019, and production was beginning disrupted in Venezuela. Given the current demand- supply assessment and signals extracted from the futures market, the baseline scenario assumes crude oil prices at an average of US$ 67 per barrel during 2019-20 (Chart I.1). Second, the nominal exchange rate (Indian rupee vis- \u00e0-vis the US dollar) has appreciated from its October 2018 level, buoyed by the steady revival of portfolio flows, softening of crude oil prices, lower domestic inflation prints, and dovish monetary policy stance in the US. Third, the pace of global economic activity and trade has turned out to be well below earlier expectations on account of elevated trade tensions, tighter financial conditions, uncertainty surrounding Brexit and slowdown in China. The global manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index touched a 32-month low in February 2019 and remained weak in March. Global growth in 2019 is expected to be lower than that in the previous two years for both advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) (Chart I.2). food and fuel has also moderated somewhat, though its level remains elevated. Overall, CPI inflation fell from 3.7 per cent in August-September 2018 to 2.6 per cent in February 2019 after touching a low of 2.0 per cent in January 2019 (Chapter II). Headline CPI inflation has declined sharply since mid-2018, driven by the sustained fall in food inflation (even turning into deflation during October 2018-February 2019), the waning away of the direct impact of house rent allowances for central government employees, and more recently, by a sharp fall in fuel inflation. CPI inflation excluding Turning to the outlook for inflation, inflation expectations of households and firms play an inflation by important role influencing price and wage contracts. Inflation expectations of urban households surveyed by the Reserve Bank in its March 2019 round1 decreased by 40 bps each over the previous round (December 2018) for the three months ahead and one year ahead horizons to 7.8 per cent and 8.1 per cent, respectively. Three-month ahead inflation expectations in the March 2019 round were lower by 160 bps vis-\u00e0-vis the September 2018 round, but were unchanged from the March 2018 round. One-year ahead inflation expectations in the March 2019 round softened by 170 bps and 50 bps from the September 2018 and March 2018 rounds, respectively. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate declined for both the three months ahead and one year ahead horizons (Chart I.3). in shaping future Manufacturing firms polled in the January-March 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expected a reduction in pressures from the 1 The Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households is conducted in 18 cities and the results of the March 2019 survey are based on responses from 5,829 households. cost of raw materials in Q1:2019-20 (less negative values for cost of raw materials indicate less input price pressures) (Chart I.4).2 The outlook on selling prices remains robust. According to the Nikkei\u2019s the purchasing managers\u2019 manufacturing sector (March 2019) and services sector (February 2019) reported some moderation in pressures on both input and output prices. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in March 2019 expected CPI inflation to increase from 2.6 per cent in February 2019 to 4.2 per cent by Q4:2019-20 (Chart I.5).3 Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from structural and other models (Box I.1), CPI inflation is projected to pick up from 2.6 per cent during February 2019 to 2.9 per cent in Q1:2019-20, 3.0 per cent in Q2, 3.5 per cent in Q3, and 3.8 per cent in Q4, with risks broadly balanced (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2019-20 are 2.5-5.2 per cent and 1.7-5.9 per cent, respectively. For 2020-21, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will move in a range of 3.8-4.1 per cent. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for Q4:2020-21 are 2.6-5.7 per cent and 1.8-6.5 per cent, respectively. There are a number of upside and downside risks to the baseline inflation forecasts. The major upside include: geopolitical tensions and supply risks 2 The results of the January-March 2019 round of the industrial outlook survey are based on responses from 1,258 companies. 3 25 panelists participated in the March 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of professional forecasters. forward-looking assessment of An accurate inflation dynamics and their macroeconomic drivers is critical for the effective conduct of monetary policy in a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) regime. Inflation ultimately reflects demand- supply imbalances in the economy. The Phillips curve relates movements in inflation to the output gap4 as a proxy for demand-supply mismatches and suggests a trade-off between inflation and output in the short run, i.e., any attempt to boost economic activity (above its potential or capacity) can intensify inflationary pressures; similarly, any policy action intended to contain inflation will involve some temporary sacrifice of output. The Phillips curve relationship, which lies at the core of modern monetary theory and policy, has come under scrutiny over the past decade in view of inflation being largely impervious to large swings in economic activity and employment, especially in major advanced economies. These developments have lent credence to the argument that the curve has flattened or may even be dead reflecting, inter inflation expectations, alia, the well-anchored increased global integration, and uncertainty about the true output gap (Hooper et al., 2019). Another view is that the relationship may be non-linear (convex): inflation is less responsive to low or negative values of the output gap but could be highly sensitive to a large and increasing positive output gap. This could be due to the downward rigidity in wages and prices, which dampens the impact of low or negative output gaps on wages/prices and hence inflation. The non-linearity could also occur if there is a decline in trend inflation, as a result of which firms adjust prices less frequently implying a flatter Phillips curve, and a steeper curve for an increase in trend inflation (Ball et al., 1988). In emerging markets like India, the Phillips curve framework continues to be relevant for the conduct of monetary policy, despite recurrent and large supply shocks (Patra et al., 2017). The Phillips curve is a key pillar of the RBI\u2019s workhorse Quarterly Projection Model (QPM)5 (Benes et al., 2016). In the QPM, core inflation (i.e., inflation excluding food and fuel) depends on: (a) the output gap; (b) expected inflation as well as its past values to capture both the forward-looking and the adaptive (backward-looking) components of the inflation process; (c) the real exchange rate: as depreciation raises the domestic cost of imported intermediate inputs and final goods, there is upward pressure on domestic prices; and, (d) domestic food and fuel prices. Taking various interactions, feedbacks and policy reactions within the QPM, a positive shock to the output gap increases core and headline inflation and the peak effect occurs with a lag of 3-5 quarters, the impact being stronger and faster for core inflation than for headline inflation (Chart I.1.1). 4 The output gap can be defined as the difference between actual output and its potential level (as per cent of the potential level) (Chapter III). A negative (positive) output gap indicates that the actual output level is less (more) than its potential, i.e., demand is less (more) than supply. A negative output gap exerts downward pressure on inflation, while a positive output gap exerts upward pressure on inflation. 5 The QPM belongs to the tradition of new-Keynesian open economy models, in which monetary policy matters for output dynamics in the short run. Apart from equations for inflation (the Phillips curve for core inflation, and separate equations for food and fuel inflation), the QPM incorporates relationships for the output gap (the IS curve), the short-term interest rate (a policy reaction function), and the exchange rate (an uncovered interest parity condition). As noted earlier, the relationship between inflation and the output gap could be non-linear, with the impact of the output gap increasing more than proportionally as it turns positive. Accordingly, the following equation for core inflation is estimated using an exponential formulation for the output gap term: where \u03c0t is the quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) seasonally- adjusted annualised rate (SAAR) of core inflation (i.e., inflation excluding food and fuel items). OG is the output gap estimated using a multivariate Kalman filter. t\u03c0 is the q-o-q SAAR food inflation and \u0394crudet is the q-o-q annualised change in the Indian basket crude oil price in Indian rupees.6 The regression estimates, using quarterly data from Q1:2004-05 to Q3:2018-19, provide evidence in favour of convexity and the regression diagnostics are satisfactory:7 Ball, L., N.G. Mankiw, and D. Romer (1988), \u201cThe New Keynesian Economics and the Output- Inflation Trade-off\u201d, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1988(1), 1-82. i=0 a5i = 0.02 (0.03). Note: Figures in parentheses are p-values. The results indicate that the Phillips curve is relatively flat for negative output gaps, but the impact increases rapidly with positive output gaps (Chart I.I.2). Such a relationship could occur if, for instance, the pricing power increases more than proportionally with the strengthening of economic activity. The results suggest the need for monetary policy to be vigilant in times of large positive output gaps. disruptions in the global crude oil market; volatility in international and domestic financial markets; the risk of a sudden reversal in the prices of volatile perishable food items; and, fiscal slippages. Among the downside risks are: a sharper than anticipated slowdown in global growth and its softening impact on crude oil and other commodity prices; and the persistence of a food supply glut keeping headline inflation below the baseline path. Inflation forecasts are critical for the conduct of forward-looking monetary policy and they play a 6 In view of their large weight in the consumption basket, food and fuel groups are also included in the equation to assess their spillover on core inflation. 7 R2 = 0.79; Durbin's alternative test for autocorrelation (p-value) = 0.07; LM test for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (p-value) = 0.98; Ramsey RESET test for omitted variable bias (p-value) = 0.17. The equation includes dummies to control for the spikes in inflation due to the pay commission awards on house rent allowances. Overall optimism in the manufacturing sector for the quarter ahead registered some moderation in the March 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey due to some dip in prospects for production, order books, exports, and capacity utilisation (Chart I.8). Surveys by other agencies indicate a mixed picture on future business expectations (Table I.3). Firms in the manufacturing and services sectors polled in the Nikkei\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 survey were optimistic about one-year ahead output prospects. In the March 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, professional forecasters expected real GDP growth to recover from 6.6 per cent in Q3:2018-19 to 7.5 per cent in Q4:2019-20 (Chart I.9). special role in an inflation targeting framework by acting as an intermediate target. An analysis of cross-country forecast errors indicates that there is a positive correlation of the errors with the share of food in the CPI basket (Box I.2). As noted earlier, economic activity weakened in the second half of 2018-19. Looking ahead, favourable factors such as an increase in financial flows to the commercial sector, stabilisation of crude oil and other commodity prices, consumption- and investment- enhancing proposals in the Union Budget 2019- 20, and, the expectation of a normal monsoon are expected to boost economic activity. However, there could be headwinds from greater than expected moderation in global growth and global trade as well as unanticipated volatility in global financial markets. Turning to the forward-looking surveys, consumer confidence a year ahead has increased considerably in the March 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey on positive sentiment pertaining to the general economic situation and the employment scenario (Chart I.7).8 Taking into account the baseline assumptions, survey indicators, the cut in the policy repo rate in the February 2019 policy and model forecasts, real GDP growth is projected to improve from 7.0 per cent in 2018-19 to 7.2 per cent in 2019-20 \u2013 6.8 per cent in Q1, 7.1 per cent in Q2, 7.3 per cent in Q3, and 7.4 per cent in Q4 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path (Table I.4). For 2020-21, the structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 7.4 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 7.3- 7.5 per cent, assuming a normal monsoon, and no major exogenous or policy shocks. There are upside as well as downside risks to the baseline growth scenario (Chart I.10). The boost to private investment activity from faster resolution of stressed assets and increased as well as more broad-based credit offtake amidst rising capacity utilisation can raise the baseline growth projection. Conversely, further escalation of trade tensions and protectionist trends, increased volatility in global financial conditions over the uncertainty of the stance of monetary policy in the US and other advanced economies, uncertainty surrounding Brexit, a sharper slowdown in the Chinese economy and deviations of the south-west monsoon from the baseline assumption of a normal monsoon may pose downside risks to the baseline growth path. 8 The survey is conducted by the Reserve Bank in 13 major cities and the March 2019 round is based on responses from 5,343 respondents. RBI\u2019s bi-monthly resolutions provide inflation forecasts for up to four quarters ahead. The Monetary Policy Report (MPR), released twice a year (April and October), provides inflation forecasts up to eight quarters ahead. Inflation forecasts for the period from April 2015 to September 2018 for up to four quarters ahead are benchmarked vis-\u00e0- vis those of some major central banks. Inflation in India eased significantly for a few months following demonetisation, which imparted a large upward bias to the forecasts made prior to November 2016 and for a few subsequent months. The analysis, therefore, presents results for the full sample period as well as for the period excluding demonetisation. The sample period also includes the introduction of the goods and services tax \u2013 a major structural reform measure \u2013 in July 2017 which, as the cross- country evidence suggests, adds uncertainty to the inflation outlook during the implementation stage. 8 per cent for India vis-\u00e0-vis 0-13 per cent for the sample countries. Similarly, the mean absolute forecast error and the root mean squared error for RBI forecasts are within the ranges observed for the sample countries. The share of food in the CPI basket varies widely across countries, which could have a significant bearing on forecast errors. Absolute measures of errors are found to be correlated with the share of food items in the CPI. There is a considerable flattening of the relationship once the forecast errors are standardised with respective inflation targets (Chart I.2.1). A desirable characteristic of a good forecast is that it should be unbiased, i.e., on average, the forecast error should be zero. Unbiasedness can be tested by regressing forecast errors on a constant by estimating the following equation: et+q,t = \u03b1q + ut+q,t, The mean forecast error for the sample excluding the demonetisation period is (-) 30 bps9 as compared with a range of 0 to (-) 40 bps for the other sample countries (Table I.2.1).10 The standardised mean error (i.e., the mean error divided by the respective inflation targets of the sample countries) is around where et+q,t is forecast error q quarters ahead, \u03b1q is constant, and ut+q,t is the residual term.

(\u03b1q ) should be statistically insignificant. For India, for the full sample period, there is evidence of a statistically significant upward bias, reflecting the decline in inflation after demonetisation. Adjusting for the period of demonetisation, the forecasts for one and three quarters ahead are unbiased (Table I.2.2). The relatively limited sample size for longer forecast horizons, however, constrains a conclusive assessment (Raj et al., 2019).

Sources: Central bank websites; RBI staff estimates. The baseline projections of growth and inflation presented in the previous sections are based on a set of assumptions explained in Table I.2. However, there are substantial uncertainties around these baseline assumptions which pose risks, both upside and downside, to the baseline projections. various plausible alternative scenarios are discussed below: Global growth and trade have surprised on the downside in recent quarters. The baseline scenario and inflation could be lower by around 15-20 bps and in Table I.2, therefore, assumes some slowdown in global growth in 2019 vis-\u00e0-vis preceding years. However, global growth could turn out to be even lower on further escalation of trade tensions, volatility in global financial markets, more-than-envisaged slowdown in the Euro area and China, and limited monetary and fiscal policy space in major countries. In such circumstances, if global growth turns out to be 50 bps below the baseline, domestic GDP growth 10 bps, respectively, below the baseline. On the other than currently anticipated on the back of a benign inflation outlook, could provide support to the global economy. Should global growth turn out to be 50 bps Gross fixed capital formation (per cent of GDP) Credit growth of scheduled commercial banks Combined gross fiscal deficit (per cent of GDP) GNDI: Gross National Disposable Income. Source: RBI staff estimates; and Survey of Professional Forecasters (March 2019). inflation could be around 15-20 bps and 10 bps above the baseline (Charts I.11 and I.12). Global crude oil prices have declined sharply from their October 2018 levels; however, the short- and medium-term outlook remains uncertain. If oil supply becomes constricted due to geopolitical tensions and continuing OPEC production cuts, there could be a sudden and large upward pressure on oil prices. Assuming an increase in the Indian basket crude oil prices to around US$ 77 per barrel, inflation could be higher by 30 bps and growth could be weaker by around 20 bps. On the other hand, if global economic activity disappoints more than expected for the earlier noted reasons, crude oil demand could be lower. Moreover, the effectiveness of production cuts by the OPEC may be impaired if there is a compensating increase in shale output. If the Indian basket crude price were to fall to US$ 57 per barrel, inflation could ease by around 30 bps, with a boost of around 20 bps to growth. The nominal exchange rate of the Indian rupee vis- \u00e0-vis the US dollar has appreciated from its October level, after coming under sustained pressure during August-September 2018. Higher crude oil prices and volatility in portfolio flows could put downward pressure on the Indian rupee. A depreciation of the Indian rupee by around 5 per cent relative to the baseline could increase inflation by around 20 bps, while providing a boost of 15 bps to growth. Conversely, India\u2019s sound domestic fundamentals and increased capital inflows can lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency. An appreciation of the Indian rupee by 5 per cent could soften inflation by around 20 bps and lower growth by around 15 bps. Food India remained softer than expected in 2018-19, dipping into negative territory during October 2018-February 2019. Domestic food production is at historically high levels. The baseline path assumes food inflation to edge higher, with the dissipation of base effects. Going forward, adequate buffer stocks in cereals, a favourable demand-supply balance in many food items and continuing low global food prices could keep food inflation under check in 2019-20. Owing to these factors, should food inflation remain below the projected path by 100 bps, headline inflation may remain below the baseline by up to around 50 bps. On the other hand, given the unusually low food inflation, there is a risk of a sudden reversal in the prices of perishable food items. Should the monsoon be deficient, this may reduce agricultural production and exert upward pressure on food prices. In this scenario, GDP growth could be lower by around 30 bps in 2019-20, and higher food prices may push up headline inflation above the baseline by around 50 bps by the end of 2019-20. In 2018-19, the Centre\u2019s indirect tax collections trailed budget estimates and contributed to the fiscal deficit turning out to be higher in the revised estimates. The baseline projections assume a fiscal stance as announced in the budgets for 2019-20. Going forward, alternative farm support schemes and farm loan waivers announced by some state governments, higher minimum support prices and food procurement, and lower direct tax collections could put upward pressure on the combined fiscal deficit. Should there be a fiscal slippage on account of such factors, this could crowd out private investment, impact potential output, and result in higher inflation. Conversely, with the stabilisation of the GST, indirect tax revenues could improve more than currently budgeted, which could help contain deficits, and provide higher resources for private investment, enhance potential output and reduce inflation. To sum up, headline CPI inflation is expected to move up from its recent lows as the favourable base effects dissipate but is expected to remain below the target of 4 per cent. Higher crude oil prices, volatility in international financial markets, the risk of a sudden reversal in the prices of perishable food items, and fiscal slippages are, however, upside risks to the inflation trajectory. Softer crude oil and commodity prices on the back of a sharper slowdown in global growth, and the persistence of low food inflation pose downside risks to the headline inflation path. Real GDP growth is expected to recover in 2019-20. Private consumption is likely to remain its mainstay and investment activity is expected to remain strong. Recapitalisation of public sector banks and the ongoing improvement in their financials, and resolution of stressed assets under the insolvency and bankruptcy code are expected to improve bank credit offtake and support investment and aggregate demand. The policy repo rate cut in February 2019 and the demand-enhancing proposals in the Union Budget 2019-20 are also expected to boost aggregate demand. Deceleration in global trade and global GDP growth, however, poses downside risks to domestic economic activity. Consumer price inflation has weakened in a broad-based manner with food prices contracting for five consecutive months since September 2018, fuel inflation collapsing and inflation excluding food and fuel softening even though it remains at an elevated level. Nominal growth in rural wages for both agricultural and non-agricultural labourers remained muted and pressure from staff costs in the organised sector was range-bound in Q3:2018-19. Industrial and farm input costs moderated considerably. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation surprised on the downside in Q4:2018-19, falling to 2.0 per cent in the softening, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained at an elevated level during 2018-19 (up was the lowest reading since June 2017 when it briefly fell to 1.5 per cent. Although it edged up in February, its remaining sticky. momentum remained weak relative to expectations. Amendments to the RBI Act in 2016 enjoin it to set out Prices of food and beverages contracted for five consecutive months since September 2018 leading to any, and explain the underlying reasons thereof. The series so far. Fuel and light inflation collapsed from projected CPI inflation at 3.9 per cent in Q3:2018-19, its recent peak in September tracking the softness rising gradually to 4.5 per cent in Q4. Actual inflation CPI excluding food and fuel also softened since in initial conditions (assumptions) that were set out inflation dissipating 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year changes in all-India CPI combined (Rural + Urban). Food prices moved into deflation from October 2018, with a sustained fall in prices of vegetables, fruits and sugar due to robust supplies. In contrast to past trends, milk prices declined abruptly in October coming from high domestic availability. Furthermore, prices of cereals and pulses also saw declines during H2:2018-19 in spite of an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs). Crude oil prices, which were assumed to remain at US$ 80 per barrel at the time of the October MPR, fell sharply to touch a low of US$ 52 per barrel by end-December, before reverting to US$ 68 per barrel by end-March, pulling down inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel. Mirroring this downturn in crude oil prices, domestic LPG prices also collapsed from their recent peak in November. In addition, the trajectory of electricity inflation shifted dramatically downwards since November 2018, pulling down fuel inflation from 8.5 per cent in October to 1.2 per cent in February 2019. In the event, the path of inflation fell below projections by 1.3 percentage points in Q3 The sustained softening in headline inflation during H2:2018-19 reflected initially the combined impact of (October-November) and thereafter a sharp decline in price momentum even when these base effects turned adverse (December-January).2 CPI food, driven down by favourable base effects and a decline in prices, moved into deflation in October 2018, which further deepened in November and persisted till Ferbuary 2019. It was only in February that contraction in food prices got arrested. In the fuel group, inflation moderated sharply on a sustained fall in price momentum. Price momentum in CPI excluding food and fuel, which registered a sharp pick-up in October, moderated thereafter during November-January, with tailwinds from favourable base effects resulting in a moderation of inflation. However, there was an upturn in price momentum in this category in February (Chart II.3). This, along with an upturn in food momentun caused CPI headline momentum to turn positive in February. The distribution of inflation across CPI groups in 2018-19 had striking commonalities with the preceding year, with similar median inflation rates and a persistent negative skewness in both the years emanating from food prices (Chart II.4). Diffusion indices of price changes in CPI items on a seasonally adjusted basis showed moderation during September- January. Much of it was reversed in February; however, more than four-fifths of the CPI basket, comprising both goods and services, experienced price increases, indicating a generalised pick-up in prices in that month (Chart II.5).3 2 Change in CPI y-o-y inflation between any two consecutive months can be approximated as the difference between the current m-o-m change in the price index (momentum) and the m-o-m change in the price index 12 months earlier (base effect). For more details see Box I.1 of the September 2014 MPR. 3 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. A reading above 50 for the diffusion index signals a broad expansion or the extent of generalisation of price increases and a reading below 50 signals a broad-based price decline. A historical decomposition of inflation shows that the moderation in inflation in H2:2018-19 was largely the result of favourable supply side shocks - particularly to prices of food and crude oil. Subdued demand pressures opened up a slightly negative output gap, which along with muted wage growth, produced a generalised decline in inflation (Chart II.6a).4 30-day recall) in Q3, and imported goods (gold, refined The break-up of overall inflation into goods and services components shows the predominant role of prices of goods in this broad-based downturn (Chart II.6b). These include perishable goods like vegetables and fruits (with a 7-day recall), non- perishable goods like cereals and pulses (with a central government employees dissipated 4 Historical decompositions are used to estimate the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period, based on a vector auto regression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 the annual growth rate in crude oil prices; inflation; the output gap; the annual growth rate in rural wages and the policy repo rate. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et ; where et represents a vector of shocks [oil price shock; supply shock (inflation shock); output gap shock; wage shock; and policy shock]. Using a Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. 5 India\u2019s imports are dominated by crude petroleum & petroleum products (around 22.0 per cent of total imports). The other major components of imports are electronic goods (10.0 per cent), gold and silver (8.0 per cent), chemical and chemical products (6.0 per cent), metal and metal products (5.5 per cent) and vegetables oils (3.0 per cent). Also, the domestic prices of items such as raw cotton move in tandem with international cotton prices. Prices of vegetables, which account for 6.0 per cent of were the principal driver of the unusual food inflation contributed 9.5 per cent to overall inflation during dynamics witnessed during the year; the other key April 2018 - February 2019 as compared with 28.9 driver was fruits. A sharp fall in prices of vegetables and fruits, combined with a moderation/decline in the food group moved into negative territory from October 2018 and was at (-) 0.1 per cent in February 2019 (Chart II.7a). Four food sub-groups \u2013 fruits, confectionery kept overall food prices in deflationary of 12.7 per cent in the CPI basket \u2013 remained in of food prices in early 2018-19 has, in fact, defied the the food and beverages group) picked up to 1.3 per per cent in January, primarily driven by a modest rice was at 115.6 million tonnes in 2018-19, up from (fourth advance estimates). A decomposition of CPI cereals inflation shows a negative contribution of historical pattern. Also, the rise in food prices during February was, in contrast to past trends, driven largely by a turnaround in fruits prices and recovery in prices of vegetables. Within vegetables, inflation in respect of onion prices declined from a high of 40.6 per cent in July 2018 to (-) 57.1 per cent in January 2019, followed by some pick- up in February to (-) 49.5 per cent. Gains in kharif production, higher mandi arrivals as well as release of old stocks aided this fall. Tomato prices remained in deflation from March 2018 to January 2019, with negative momentum during August 2018 - February 2019 (barring January), again on account of healthy mandi arrivals and higher production. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the pick-up in tomato prices in January 2019 was largely due to delayed harvesting on account of acute cold conditions following rainfall in Nashik \u2013 a major tomato-growing district in Maharashtra, crop damage by fungus in Karnataka and adverse impact on the crop by cyclone Gaja in Tamil Nadu (particularly, in Dindigul, which is a major tomato supplier). However, inflation in respect of potatoes remained in double digits throughout 2018-19 (up to February), despite some moderation since October 2018. Price pressures were visible during March-July 2018 due to lower availability of stocks from cold storages, transport disruptions and protests organised by potato farmers (Chart II.9a). With fresh arrivals entering the market on the back of a bumper winter crop, prices declined during November-February. On the whole, a significantly lower build-up in the cumulative momentum of prices of vegetables in 2018-19 relative to the previous year helped in keeping food inflation low. An analysis of prices of vegetables based on sectoral CPI indices suggests that even as month-on-month volatility was higher in urban markets than their rural counterparts, the difference in monthly changes in prices between rural and urban areas was not found to be statistically significant, suggesting that rural-urban price changes were broadly in the same direction.6 A decomposition of CPI-vegetables into trend and cyclical components reveals that a large cyclical downturn till December 2018 was the key mover as the trend component remained more or less flat (Chart II.9b). Some upturn observed since January 2019 in the cyclical component of prices has contributed to a lower rate of decline in prices of vegetables in Q4 (January-February). Prices of fruits (weight of 2.9 per cent in the CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages group) were another downside surprise during 2018-19. Fruit prices fell in June-July 2018, contrary to past 6 Based on a F-test and t-test framework. The robustness of the results was tested using both seasonally-adjusted and unadjusted data. prices have been ruling well below their historical (particularly apples and citrus fruits) pulled down domestic prices. Overall, prices of fruits witnessed domestic production, increased open market sales pattern (Chart II.10). While deflation in fruits prices contributed to the subdued food inflation. The persisted during December 2018 - February 2019, their momentum underwent a sharp upturn in February ` 2 per kg. to ` 31 per kg. by the central government in February 2019 has not yet been reflected in domestic In the case of prices of pulses, deflation persisted Prices of oils and fats remained subdued since on the back of oversupply, although this trend is reversing gradually. Pulses account for 2.4 per cent production is likely to go up marginally by 0.6 per was (-) 6.0 per cent during April-February 2018-19 as is offset by higher production in soybean and mustard 19 remaining broadly at the previous year\u2019s level, seeds. The Government of India has also reduced the import duty on crude palm oil and refined, bleached and urad have recovered and moved up towards their and deodorised (RBD) palm oil imports from Malaysia MSPs in some of the major producing states. Pulses fish witnessed upside pressure. In the case of eggs, inflation after remaning in negative territory during November 2018 - January 2019, turned positive in February. Meat and fish prices also experienced upside pressures that are typical during the winter months. Inflation in respect of meat and fish was at 5.9 per cent in February, the highest since October 2016, due to higher input prices relating to maize and soybean that constitute animals and poultry feed stock. After reaching an intra-year high of 3.0 per cent in November, inflation in spices eased to 1.8 per cent in February on account of a broad-based decline in prices, reflecting higher expected production of turmeric, dried chillies, dhania and jeera. Fuel and light inflation, which was at 8.5 per cent in October 2018, moderated to 4.5 per cent in December and further to 1.2 per cent in February on account of a fall in prices of LPG along with sustained moderation in electricity, and firewood and chips prices (Chart II.12a). After registering significant price increases between June and November, domestic LPG prices declined abruptly since December, following a collapse in prices in the international market. After the migration of subsidy payments on LPG to bank accounts under the direct benefit transfer scheme, LPG prices in CPI mirror open market prices, which, in turn, track international prices closely (Chart II.12b). Inflation in electricity, which constitute around one- third of the fuel and light sub-group, moderated to an average of 0.6 per cent in H2:2018-19 (up to February), after hovering around 3 per cent during H1:2018-19. Energy deficit continues to decline despite the stagnation in generation of electricity in January-February 2019 (0.7 per cent y-o-y growth) indicating subdued demand, which is also reflected in low spot prices at the Indian Energy Exchange during this period. Inflation in respect of items of rural consumption such as firewood and chips, which remained sticky and elevated till October, since then declined by 5.4 percentage points to touch 0.6 per cent in February, accentuating the fall in the fuel group inflation. However, administered kerosene prices registered sustained increases as oil marketing companies (OMCs) raised prices in a calibrated manner to phase out subsidy. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel saw an uptick in October 2018 which was, however, short-lived as it softened sequentially from 6.2 per cent in October to 5.2 per cent in January 2019 before edging up marginally to 5.4 per cent in February. It is noteworthy though that CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has remained above 5 per cent since December 2017. Excluding volatile items such as petrol, diesel, gold and silver, CPI inflation remained between 5.5-5.8 per cent since October (Chart II.13). Housing, having a weight of 21.3 per cent in CPI excluding food and fuel, was the largest contributor (22 per cent) to inflation in this group, even as the statistical impact of HRA increases of central government employees waned completely by December. The health sub-group, with a weight of 12.5 per cent, contributed around 18 per cent to CPI inflation excluding food and fuel during October- February (Chart II.14). sub-group The contributed around 14 per cent \u2013 the third highest \u2013 to inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel, with its contribution much below its weight of 18.2 per cent due to a sharp decline in petrol and diesel prices since November (Chart II.15a). The wedge between international and domestic prices remains considerable due to the asymmetric pass-through of international crude oil prices to domestic prices since 2014 (Chart II.15b). Among other sub-groups, education (weight of 9.4 per cent in CPI excluding food and fuel) contributed around 13 per cent to CPI inflation excluding food and fuel in H2 (up to February) due to a pick-up in inflation in tuition fee, books and journals. In contrast, a sharp moderation in clothing and footwear inflation from October 2018 pulled down its contribution to inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel to 8 per cent, well below its weight of 13.8 per cent in the group (Chart II.14). Disaggregation of CPI inflation excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel into goods and services shows that goods inflation moved in a narrow range of 4.9- 5.1 per cent during H2:2018-19 (up to February), while services inflation persisted at elevated levels \u2013 6.0-6.5 per cent. Goods inflation picked up in Q3 across commodity groups \u2013 particularly medicines, effects \u2013 offset somewhat by a sharp moderation II.16a). Sticky and elevated services inflation in Q3 was primarily on account of a rise in transportation fares, education expenses and household services, which more than offset the significant moderation in housing inflation on waning HRA effects. During January-February 2019, services inflation moderated somewhat from 6.2 per cent to 6.0 per cent as transportation services inflation eased, reflecting the lagged impact of lower fuel prices and also on account of some moderation in inflation in respect of housing, education and \u2018personal care and effects\u2019 services (Chart II.16b). Measures of inflation other than the CPI showed mixed movements since the October MPR. Inflation measured by sectoral CPIs \u2013 for industrial workers (CPI-IW), agricultural labourers (CPI-AL) and rural labourers (CPI-RL) \u2013 edged up during November to February 2019. First, food inflation in all the three sectoral CPIs was higher relative to all India CPI. Second, fuel inflation remained range bound and did not collapse in sectoral CPIs. The housing index in the CPI-IW is revised once in six months, i.e., in January and July every year. Following the increase in HRA under the 7th central pay commission (CPC), the housing index in the CPI-IW increased by 8.8 per cent and 15.9 per cent in January and July 2018, respectively, and further by 8.8 per cent in January 2019. CPI-IW inflation shot up to 7.0 per cent in February from 5.2 per cent in December, pulled up by the January 2019 increase in its housing index. fell from its October 2018 peak of 5.5 per cent to satisfied all the properties of a core measure, other than the ease of communication (Box II.1). decline in WPI inflation was led by a significant fall in and basic metals, tracking international commodity prices. GDP and GVA deflators also edged down in Q3 precious metals impart high dispersion, asymmetry gauge underlying inflation dynamics, one way is to remove high positive as well as negative skewness trimming the tails. In addition to exclusion based measures discussed earlier, trimmed means of CPI have softened sequentially over the last six months Underlying cost conditions have largely co-moved with WPI inflation. Industrial and farm costs captured under the WPI picked up in Q1:2018-19 and remained elevated till November 2018, after which they moderated considerably (Chart II.18). Global crude oil prices declined sharply during November- December 2018 from their peak levels in October 2018 before edging up in January and February 2019. This decline got passed on to prices of inputs such as high-speed diesel, aviation turbine fuel, naphtha, bitumen, furnace oil and petroleum coke, pulling down domestic farm and non-farm input costs. Though some of the petroleum product prices increased in February 2019, reflecting the increase in crude oil prices, industrial input costs continued to decelerate due to a sharp decline in mineral prices. Inflation measures, which remove the volatile components and represent the durable component of inflation, can be evaluated against desirable properties of 'core' inflation. An analysis of eleven inflation measures suggests that none of the exclusion-based measures satisfied all the properties of 'core' inflation. However, two statistical measures, viz., trimmed means (5 per cent and 10 per cent) Among other industrial raw materials, domestic coal inflation eased during January-February 2019 largely due to favourable base effects. Inflation in paper and pulp prices edged up in Q3:2018-19 due to rising production costs and global prices. Inflation in fibres picked up in Q2 and Q3 after being in negative territory in Q1. However, it has moderated since Movements in headline inflation are influenced by its trend and by changes of a temporary nature. While the transitory elements largely reflect supply shocks, the trend component responds to changes in aggregate demand conditions and expectations. This persistent component of inflation, often referred to as core or underlying inflation, provides an important guide to the future path of headline inflation. Hence, a core inflation measure is often used by monetary authorities as an input for the conduct of monetary policy. Two commonly used approaches to measure core inflation are (i) exclusion-based measures i.e., excluding some highly volatile elements from the headline such as food and fuel; and (ii) statistical measures such as median or trimmed mean. There are some properties that a core inflation measure should satisfy: credibility: a measure of core inflation should be timely, credible (verifiable by agents independent of the central bank) and easily understood by the public. mean and standard deviation: a core inflation measure should have the same mean as the headline, but lower standard deviation. reversion: an appropriate measure of core inflation is the one to which headline reverts; hence, core inflation measure can be a good predictor of future inflation. core inflation causes headline, but headline does not cause core: core and headline need to be cointegrated with a unitary coefficient (termed as unbiasedness). In other words, core is strongly exogenous (with respect to headline), but headline is not. correlation with past monetary policy: monetary policy over a longer horizon is more likely to be correlated with durable or core CPI inflation. A total of eleven CPI core measures for India were considered out of which six were exclusion-based measures, viz.: (i) excluding food and fuel; (ii) excluding food, petrol and diesel; (iii) excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel; (iv) excluding food, petrol, diesel, gold and silver; (v) excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold and silver; and (vi) excluding food, fuel, petrol, diesel, gold, silver and housing. Five statistical measures considered are: (i) trimmed mean (5 per cent); (ii) trimmed mean (10 per cent); (iii) trimmed mean (20 per cent); (iv) median; and (v) reweighting the index based on historical standard deviation. Based on data from January 2012 to February 2019, headline inflation is treading below the lower range of the band constructed by using all the eleven core measures (Chart II.1.1). For the full period, all exclusion-based measures satisfied all the properties other than (i) being a robust future inflation predictor; and (ii) correlation with past monetary policy (Table II.1.1). However, if the sample period is truncated to mid-July 2018, the property of being an efficient future inflation predictor is also satisfied. This suggests that the recent unusual period of low and persistent food inflation has impaired the predictive properties of exclusion-based measures. Also, the property of correlation with the past monetary policy was not satisfied by any exclusion-based measure. This was possibly due to the reason that it was only in January Co integrated Trimmed Mean (5 per cent) Trimmed Mean (10 per cent) Trimmed Mean (20 per cent) Note: \u221a: property satisfied; x: property not satisfied. 2014 that the RBI adopted CPI as the headline inflation measure. It is also significant that often inflation in WPI and sectoral CPIs registered wide divergence. The trimmed mean measures (5 per cent and 10 per cent) satisfied all the desirable properties in the full sample. However, statistical measures of core inflation are not easy to communicate. Occasional Papers, Vol. 32, No. 3, Winter, pp 37-66. December 2018 due to softening prices of raw cotton of fertilisers and pesticides increased in Q2:2018- 19 and Q3, while fodder inflation turned positive in January 2019 and edged up further in February, Fertiliser prices rose in line with the increase in global prices of phosphate and potash, while prices of pesticides were impacted by an uptick in global crude oil prices. Inflation in respect of agricultural machinery and implements prices picked up in Q2 and Q3, but eased marginally in Q4 (up to February). Inflation in electricity, which carries a high weight in both industrial and farm inputs, remained elevated and volatile during 2018-19. after remaining negative for 16 consecutive months. Nominal growth in rural wages for both agricultural and non-agricultural labourers remained muted in Q3:2018-19, reflecting the lagged impact of moderate rural inflation and low food prices (Chart II.19). Pressures from staff costs in the organised sector have been range-bound. Per employee staff costs in the manufacturing sector, which declined in the first two quarters of 2018-19, edged up in Q3:2018- 19. In the services sector, per employee staff cost growth increased by 2.2 per cent in Q3:2018-19 as compared with 0.1 per cent in the previous quarter (Chart II.20a). Unit labour costs for companies in the manufacturing sector ticked up in Q3:2018-19.7 In the services sector, unit labour costs flattened in Q1:2018-19 but edged up in the next two quarters. The growth in staff costs outpaced the growth in value of production in both the manufacturing and services sectors in Q3 (Chart II.20b). outlook survey. Fewer firms assessed an increase in cost of raw materials in Q4:2018-19 than in the last two quarters and the decline is expected to continue in Q1:2019-20. Firms passed the cost benefit on to their selling prices in Q4 and expected moderation in selling prices in the first quarter of 2019-20. in the manufacturing purchasing Firms polled managers\u2019 index (PMI) also reported a decline in input costs and selling prices for the second consecutive quarter in Q4:2018-19. However, the rate of decline in selling prices was lower than that of input costs. In contrast, input cost inflation reported by firms in the services sector in the PMI was marginally higher in Q4:2018-19 than in the previous quarter. The increase in prices charged by these firms remained subdued in Q3 and Q4. Easing of commodity prices, particularly of crude petroleum, mineral oils and metals, was also reflected in the moderation in input costs of manufacturing firms covered in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial 7 Unit labour cost is defined as the ratio of staff cost to value of production. Headline CPI inflation movements were characterised large extent, by unprecedented and, unanticipated collapse in inflation in food and fuel, which together constitute around 53 per cent of the CPI basket. Inflation in the remaining 47 per cent of the CPI basket, comprising items excluding food and fuel, also moderated somewhat in Q4:2018-19, notwithstanding the fact that the levels were still elevated. Inflation outcomes going forward will largely be shaped by movements in food inflation. Record agricultural production, high stocks of food grains and effective supply management measures by the government have kept food inflation in check in recent years. Should the monsoon turn out to be normal, food inflation is likely to remain contained in 2019-20. The fuel inflation trajectory is also likely to be shaped by movements in international energy prices. Should the domestic economic activity slow down further, it will reduce the risk of sudden demand side pressures impinging on CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Inflation expectations of both households and producers have softened, and professional forecasters also expect inflationary pressures to remain contained. There are also some upside risks to inflation, which emanate largely from oil \u2013 from a further tightening of crude supplies due to continuing production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Iran sanctions and Venezuela turmoil, as also from the demand side if trade tensions are resolved suitably. Fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, if any, represents another medium-term risk to the inflation trajectory through higher aggregate demand pressures and crowding out of private investment. Given its past volatility, food inflation reversal poses another significant upside risk, especially in view of reports of some probability of El Ni\u00f1o this year and its implications for monsoon. On the whole, though inflation is likely to edge up from current levels, it is projected to remain within the Reserve Bank\u2019s target of 4 per cent during 2019-20. Economic activity slowed down in Q2 led mainly by a large drag from net exports, which became entrenched in Q3 due to deceleration in public spending and private consumption. On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities moderated characterised by a modest growth in kharif and horticulture production. Industrial growth also decelerated led by a slowdown in manufacturing activity. However, services sector activity remained resilient, supported primarily by construction, financial services, and public administration and defence. Domestic economic activity lost pace in Q2 and Q3, indicators suggesting a sharper with coincident deceleration in Q4. Aggregate demand weakened in Q2 by a large drag from net exports, followed by a slowdown in consumption, both private and government, in Q3. By contrast, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth remained in double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter in Q3. On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities slowed down in Q2 and Q3, with increases in kharif and horticulture production turning out to be modest relative to last year\u2019s record. Higher input costs, particularly stemming from crude oil prices, and weaker pricing power, impacted profit margins of firms and restrained manufacturing. In the services sector, activity picked up on the back of growth of financial services and which was supported by construction activity trade, infrastructure spending. However, public hotels, transport, and communication services lost momentum in Q2 and remained flat in Q3. The growth in aggregate demand, measured by y-o-y changes in real GDP at market prices, moderated to 6.5 per cent in H2:2018-19 from 7.5 per cent in H1 and 7.9 per cent a year ago. The slowdown was caused by lower though still healthy growth of 9.1 per cent in GFCF in H2 as compared with 10.9 per cent in H1. Private consumption was sustained by higher spending on durable goods and services, while government spending accelerated in H2 on account of higher spending by states. These disparate movements were reflected in shifts in weighted contributions of the components to GDP growth (Chart III.1a and Table III.1). Overall, however, the moderation in GDP growth in H2 can be attributed to adverse base effects even as momentum, measured by the q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised growth rate (SAAR), accelerated during the same period (Chart III.1b).

Source: CSO. The October 2018 Monetary Policy Report (MPR) projected GDP growth at 7.4 per cent in Q2, 7.3 per cent in Q3 and 7.1 per cent in Q4 of 2018-19, with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path (Chart III.2). Actual outcomes in terms of the second advance estimates (SAE) of the CSO released on February 28, 2019 undershot these projections by 40 and 70 basis points in Q2 and Q3, respectively. The downward surprise in Q2 stemmed from a stronger than anticipated drag from net exports, mainly due to a sharp acceleration in the import bill on the back of a surge in international crude prices. In Q3, projection errors emanated mainly from a sharper than expected slowdown in government consumption as revenue expenditure growth of central government nosedived. In the event, overall GDP growth for 2018-19 at 7.0 per cent in the SAE (February 28, 2019) turned out to be lower than the projection of 7.4 per cent in the October MPR. (PFCE) Private final consumption expenditure remained the mainstay of aggregate demand, with its share rising to 57.9 per cent in H2:2018-19 from 57.0 per cent a year ago. Its resilience drew on a combination of factors, viz., low retail inflation that expanded disposable incomes, the significant softening of global crude oil prices and resulting economies in energy outgoes, expansion of public spending in rural areas, and strong growth in personal and consumer loans, notwithstanding a slowdown in agriculture and labour-intensive exports, which could have adversely impacted rural consumption (Chart III.3). High frequency indicators of urban consumption have, in Q4:2018-19. Growth in domestic air passenger traffic continued to decelerate (Chart III.4.a). Passenger car sales have been contracting since July 2018, inter alia, due to volatility in fuel prices and mandated long- however, moderated term upfront insurance premium payments. Going forward into 2019-20, urban consumption may get some support from the spending uptick associated in disposable with general elections, incomes due to a relaxation in income tax, and prospects of sustained growth in personal bank loans (Chart III.4b). Among the indicators of rural demand, sales of motorcycles remained in contraction zone. Tractor sales also sharply decelerated in recent months possibly due to weak rabi sowing and subdued farm prices. The production of consumer non- durables remained lacklustre (Chart III.5). Robust growth in construction activity in H2:2018-19 \u2013 an employment-intensive sector \u2013 should augur well for rural incomes and demand. Rural demand may also get some support from policy measures announced recently, viz., implementation of PM Kisan Samman Yojana (PMKSY), direct income transfer schemes, farm loan waivers by many states, and the government\u2019s continued thrust on rural infrastructure spending. Growth in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) has remained in double digits since Q3:2017-18, though it is likely to slow down in Q4 as some of the key indicators of investment demand, viz., capital goods production and imports have decelerated. The share of GFCF in GDP improved to 32.3 per cent in 2018-19 from 31.4 per cent a year ago, indicating an incipient strengthening of investment demand. The pick-up in fixed investment was supported by higher construction activity, led by the government\u2019s drive to boost spending on the road sector and affordable housing. The performance of software firms \u2013 a proxy for investment in intellectual property products \u2013 has also been healthy as reflected in their latest financial results. The ongoing resolution of distressed assets of non-financial corporates under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process is expected to unlock resources for investment activity. However, growth of capital goods imports \u2013 another proxy for investment demand \u2013 contracted in February 2019 (Chart III.6a). Production of capital goods also either contracted or remained tepid from November 2018 to January 2019. Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation (CU-SA), however, crossed its long-term average in Q3:2018- 19, which could encourage fresh capacity addition and capex (Chart III.6b). Sustained growth in housing loans disbursed by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) also bodes well for investment in dwellings. investment (FDI) (see Chart III.7; and Chapter IV for details). Overall, there has been an improvement in non-financial corporate sector, which should support listed non- government non-financial (NGNF) companies suggest The pick-up in investment demand was financed by non-food bank credit and inflows of foreign direct (Chart III.8).1 The decline in the capex ratio for iron and steel was on account of overall deleveraging that was underway in the sector; on the other hand, the ratio for petroleum product firms improved significantly. With debt levels declining in some sectors and the resolution of stressed assets under the IBC, the capex ratio could improve, going forward. of GDP in 2011-12 to 17.2 per cent in 2017-18. While the private corporate sector financed its investment predominantly through its own saving, the public sector continues to rely heavily on households for resources (Chart III.9b). Notwithstanding the investment rate has declined significantly since 2012-13, mirroring the decline in the saving rate over these years (Chart III.9a). The savings rate of the household sector, which is a net supplier of funds to the economy, declined from 23.6 per cent Government expenditure (GFCE) supported aggregate demand in H2:2018-19, especially in Q4. GFCE is likely to augment aggregate demand in 2019-20 too, in view of higher outgoes in the Interim Union Budget on agriculture and various income support schemes.

While the share of petroleum subsidies is expected to rise in 2019-20, food subsidies will continue to dominate the overall subsidy bill (0.9 per cent of GDP). Although capital expenditure has a larger fiscal multiplier, relative to revenue expenditure, by crowding in private investment, the share of capital expenditure in total expenditure has remained stagnant at around 12-13 per cent in recent years (Box III.1). Note: BE: Budget Estimates. RE: Revised Estimates. Source: Union Budget, 2019-20. growth budgeted for 2019-20 is also higher than in 2018-19 (RE) (Table III.2). During 2018-19 (April-February), the fiscal position of the central government deteriorated mainly because of muted growth in indirect tax revenues (Chart III.10a and b). Revenue expenditure (87.5 per cent of total expenditure) evolved broadly as budgeted [growth of 12.5 per cent till February 2019 vis-\u00e0-vis 13.9 per cent in revised estimates (RE)], though payments of food and fertiliser subsidies were higher than a year ago. Outgoes on account of major subsidies in 2018-19 are estimated to have remained unchanged Gross tax collections fell short of the budget target in 2018-19 (RE) largely due to a shortfall in goods and services tax (GST) collections by \u20b91 trillion, though corporate tax and customs duty collections surpassed the budget targets. GST revenues at \u20b95.3 trillion during April-February 2018-19 constituted 81.5 per cent of RE. Indirect tax growth (April-February 2018- 19) remained distinctly lower at 3.3 per cent than 14.3 per cent (RE), while direct tax growth remained modest at 12.9 per cent as against 19.8 per cent in 2018-19 (RE). Consequently, the Centre\u2019s fiscal deficit was 34.2 per cent more than the revised GFD target at the end of February 2019. Accordingly, there was a cutback in capital expenditure, which contracted by 7.9 per cent in April-February 2018-19 as against the growth of 20.3 per cent envisaged in the RE, in order to contain the GFD. Fiscal policy acts as an instrument of economic stabilisation by influencing aggregate demand and smoothing it over the business cycle. In the process, changes in government spending and taxation can have a significant impact on underlying economic activity. At the height of the global financial crisis (GFC), fiscal stimulus was used widely to prevent national economies from sliding into a depression; after the crisis, however, the withdrawal of stimulus became the centre of an intense and agitated debate on \u201cgrowth versus austerity\u201d. In this context, an accurate assessment of the fiscal policy-growth relationship assumes importance for the appropriate setting of macroeconomic policy. Fiscal multiplier, defined as a ratio of a change in output to an exogenous change in a fiscal variable (viz., government expenditure/taxation or both), measures the short-term impact of discretionary fiscal policy on output. For policymakers who employ fiscal multipliers, errors in their estimation can have serious policy consequences. For instance, underestimation of fiscal multipliers in the GFC appears to have contributed significantly to growth forecast errors (Blanchard and Leigh, 2013), making countries to set unachievable fiscal targets along with errors on the quantum of adjustments required to meet growth forecasts (Eyraud and Weber, 2013), thereby undermining the credibility of fiscal programmes (Batini et al., 2014). can also be used as counter-cyclical instruments, i.e., reducing taxes and increasing spending to stimulate aggregate demand when the output gap is negative. Therefore, extracting exogenous components from observed fiscal outcomes is problematic. Moreover, fiscal multipliers provide little guidance about medium to long-term effects and fiscal sustainability. Consequently, there is little consensus on the appropriate methodology and the desirable size of multipliers. In the literature, fiscal multipliers are often estimated by using Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models, Structural Vector Auto Regressions (SVAR) or Structural Econometric Macromodels (SEM). Although DSGE models are well-grounded in economic theory, they have limited practitioner utility since they do not seem to fit the data well. By contrast, SVAR models only explore historical interactions among a group of economic variables and are considered atheoretic. In this context, SEM \u2013 which draw on elements from both DSGE and SVAR models \u2013 are considered more useful for policy analysis (Wren-Lewis, 2018). Accordingly, fiscal multipliers for India are estimated in a SEM framework, which follows the schematic representation of causal interlinkages as presented in Chart III.1.12. Fiscal multipliers are not always widely used in operational work as their estimation is fraught with difficulties. In particular, isolating the direct effect of fiscal measures on GDP is challenging in view of the problem of \u201cendogeneity\u201d \u2013 government expenditure and taxation are \u201cautomatic stabilisers\u201d which respond inevitably to the business cycle but Briefly, fiscal deficits of central and state governments are disaggregated into various budgetary spending heads in the capital and revenue accounts, shocks to which can be explored through the propagation mechanism of transmission channels. A revenue expenditure shock3 increases private consumption, thereby boosting aggregate demand (measured by the output gap) and output.

This also overcomes the effects of a small sample bias. deficit, leading to deviations from the long-term sustainable level of debt. These changes impact the in turn, inflation. Aggregate demand and inflation policy rule which, in turn, affects long-term interest In the Indian context, it is important to note that revenue expenditure multipliers for the central and state governments are less than unity. If revenue expenditure is increased by one rupee, government final consumption expenditure also increases by one rupee, which increases the output by the same amount, provided capital expenditure remains unchanged. This also induces a positive impact on consumption and hence, inflation.

In the Interim Budget (2019-20), the Centre\u2019s GFD was revised upward to 3.4 per cent of the GDP in 2018-19 (RE) from 3.3 per cent in BE; the target of 3.0 per cent of the GDP has been retained for 2020-21. The deviation in the GFD for 2018-19 was caused mainly by a large shortfall in GST collections and extension of direct income support to farmers. Against the backdrop of heightened pressure on state finances from 2015-16 to 2017-18 due to factors such as the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), farm loan waivers, pay revisions and decline in revenue collections, the consolidated GFD of 29 states was budgeted at 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2018-19. As on date, 28 states have presented vote-on-account/full consolidated the budgets position of 25 states is available, the consolidated GFD stands revised to 2.9 per cent of GDP for 2018-19 (Table III.3). Out of 15 states, which have recorded slippages, some states have introduced either alternative farm support schemes (Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal) or farm loan waivers (Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan). For 2019-20, states have budgeted for a consolidation with the GFD-GDP ratio at 2.5 per cent. Turning to financing, the borrowing programme of the Centre for H1:2018-19 was conducted as per the planned issuance schedule. The government decided to borrow less in H2:2018-19 which led to revision of market borrowing programme for 2018-19 from `6,055 billion to `5,710 billion (about 3 per cent lower than last year). Thus, the central government completed its revised borrowings as on March 22, 2019 (Table III.4). A strategy of debt consolidation was undertaken through switches to the extent of \u20b9281 billion during 2018-19. States completed their gross borrowings by March 26, 2019 amounting to \u20b94,783 billion. Net exports continued to act as a drag on aggregate demand in H2:2018-19 with growth in imports outpacing exports (Charts III.11a and 11b). Against the backdrop of slowing global trade and commerce-inhibiting trade tensions, India\u2019s merchandise exports (y-o-y) moderated during Q2 and Q3 of 2018-19 relative to Q1 (Chart III.12a). During Q2, the slowdown in exports was accentuated by a decline in shipments of readymade garments, rice and marine products; in Q3, exports growth was pulled down by gems & jewellery, engineering goods, and meat, dairy & poultry. An important feature of India\u2019s export basket in recent years has been a shift away from primary and traditional low value-added exports to higher value-added manufacturing and technology-driven items. This shift has imparted a measure of resilience to export demand in a hostile international trading environment. A comparison of key items of exports between 2011-12 and 2018-19 (April-February) reveals that there has been a significant increase in the shares of chemical and related products and engineering goods (Chart III.13). Going forward, policy initiatives such as hikes in the interest equalisation rates for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) exports from 3 per cent to 5 per cent as well as measures announced in the Agriculture Export Policy, 2018 are likely to provide a fillip to exports. After registering a five-quarter high in Q2:2018-19, merchandise import growth decelerated sharply in Q3, pulled down by declining volumes of gold imports on the back of volatile prices and lower demand (Chart III.12.b). While elevated oil prices (y-o-y basis) caused higher import bill, within non- POL non-gold imports, items such as pearls and precious stones, transport equipment and vegetable oil declined during Q3:2018-19. Further, imports contracted in January-February 2019. Reflecting these developments, the trade deficit for February has been the lowest in the last 17 months. Electronic goods have emerged as a key component of India\u2019s import demand in recent years, constituting about 11 per cent of total imports (Chart III.14). The demand for electronic products, especially electronic components, electronic instruments and consumer electronics rose in the recent period, which incrementally contributed to the trade deficit. To restrain some of these imports and to boost domestic value addition in electronics manufacturing as envisaged in the Phased Manufacturing Programme, the government has hiked customs duty on several electronic items, including mobile phones and related accessories, televisions and smart watches during 2018. While the current account deficit (CAD) widened in H1:2018-19 to 2.6 per cent of GDP on the back of a higher trade deficit, softer international oil prices and robust earnings from services exports and remittances narrowed the CAD to 2.5 per cent of GDP in Q3. Under services, software exports rode on also portend well for the outlook of software exports. international investment position (NIIP) as a ratio to GDP deteriorated somewhat in December 2018 due to a rise in liabilities of domestic residents. India\u2019s forex reserves at US$ 412.9 billion as on March 31, 2019 were at a comfortable level \u2013 equivalent to 9.5 months of imports and 182 per cent of short-term external debt (by residual maturity). Lower outgo under income account also helped in containing CAD in Q3. (FDI) flows at US$ 28.8 billion in 2018-19 (April- January) were higher than their level a year ago \u2013 flowing mainly into manufacturing, communication and financial services. Foreign portfolio investment \u2013 which made a flight to safety in 2018 due to concerns surrounding global growth, high oil prices The output growth, measured by gross value added (GVA) at basic prices, decelerated markedly to 6.3 per cent in H2:2018-19 from 7.3 per cent in H1 and 7.6 per cent a year ago (Table III.5). In contrast, its momentum measured in terms of q-o-q SAAR, accelerated to 6.7 per cent in H2 from 5.7 per cent in H1 (Chart III.15a). and trade and geopolitical tensions \u2013 resumed in Q4, buoyed, inter alia, by dovish monetary policy stances in advanced economies. Flows under non-resident improved during the year. A new framework for external commercial borrowings was put in place in January 2019, which allowed a uniform borrowing The slowdown in GVA growth (y-o-y) in H2:2018- 19 was caused by a sharp deceleration in activity in agriculture and industry. Value added in agriculture decelerated to 1.4 per cent in H2, dropping to an eleven-quarter low in Q3 and further into contraction in Q4 (implied).

Keeping in view the pattern of revisions as national accounts move from advance estimates to revised estimates, some catch-up with the previous year\u2019s level is likely. Industrial sector growth faced headwinds from subdued demand for manufacturing output and higher input costs due to an increase in oil prices in H1. Services sector activity, however, accelerated marginally, driven by resilience in construction activity and improvement in financial, real estate and professional services, and public administration, defence and other services (PADO), fuelled in part by a rise in government expenditure in H2:2018-19 (Chart III.15b). 2018-19, which indicated a minor upward revision in the production of kharif foodgrains but a lower-than- targeted rabi harvest, agricultural GVA growth for the year was revised downwards to 2.7 per cent from 3.8 per cent in the CSO\u2019s first advance estimates (FAEs) (Table III.6). Horticultural crop production was at a record level of 315 million tonnes during 2018-19, driven mainly by spices, aromatics and medicinal, flowers and vegetables. In the recent period, allied activities, which include livestock, forestry and fishing, have contributed around three-fourth of overall GVA growth of the sector (Chart III.16). GVA at basic prices in agriculture and allied activities decelerated in H2:2018-19 on account of a number of factors operating in conjunction, viz., the poor performance of the southwest and northeast monsoons, lower water reservoir levels in the eastern and western regions; unremunerative prices for farm produce depressed by the supply glut caused by two bumper harvests in succession and the lack of traction in food management policies to deal with large excess supplies, which led to heightened agrarian distress; and, unseasonal rains and hail storms. All these factors led to a shortfall of (-) 3.8 per cent in total rabi sowing from the previous year\u2019s acreage. Consequent upon the release of the SAE of crop production for As per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US, El Ni\u00f1o conditions strengthened during February 2019 as above- average sea surface temperatures increased across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. According to the latest report, there is a 80 per cent chance of El Ni\u00f1o prevailing in March-May, which will decrease to 60 per cent during the June-August period. Similarly, as per the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the chance of El Ni\u00f1o developing in 2019 has increased to approximately 70 per cent. In case the monsoon turns out to be below normal, it may pose a downside risk to agricultural production, going forward. In the industrial sector, gross value added at basic prices decelerated to 6.4 per cent in H2:2018-19 from #: Million bales of 170 kgs. each. ##: Million bales of 180 kgs. each.

IIP-based measures, viz., truncated index of industrial production (IIP), and IIP excluding digestive enzymes and antacids (DEA), also moderated during November- January 2018-19 (Chart III.18a). Manufacturing IIP decelerated in Q3:2018-19 due to a slowdown in production of motor vehicles, trailers and tractors, chemical and chemical products, rubber and plastics, coke and refinery products, textiles and beverages. Of the 23 industry groups constituting the IIP, ten contracted during Q3 as against four during Q2. In terms of the use-based classification, the production of infrastructure goods and consumer durables remained robust while consumer non-durables decelerated during Q3 (Chart III.18b). On the other hand, capital goods production contracted during Q3. The loss of speed in industrial output appears to have continued in Q4, with manufacturing growth slowing down to 1.3 per cent in January-February, 2019. In terms of use-based groups, construction/ infrastructure goods maintained pace in January, driven by strong growth of steel products. However, intermediate and capital goods production contracted, and consumer durables and consumer non-durables growth decelerated. GVA in the electricity sector accelerated in H2 in comparison with H1. However, high frequency indicators generation stagnated in January 2019 due to contraction in thermal power generation despite comfortable stocks of coal (Chart III.19). The slowdown in electricity generation was partly due to lean seasonal demand during January-February from the agriculture and household sectors on top of a slowdown in demand for electricity from industry during Q3. GVA growth in mining accelerated in H2 but was still lower than the growth in H2:2017-18. Activity in the services sector picked up and became broad-based in H2:2018-19, boosted by resilience in construction activity and acceleration in financial, real estate and professional services and PADO (Chart III.20a). The strong performance of the construction sector was also reflected in its coincident indicators \u2013 steel consumption and cement production. Beginning December 2017, cement production registered double-digit growth in all months till January 2019, barring November The Reserve Bank\u2019s business assessment index of the industrial outlook survey (IOS) for Q3:2018-19 reflected a weakening of demand conditions in the manufacturing sector, although it points to an improvement in Q4.

This was partly driven by the government\u2019s focus on the road sector and affordable housing. Growth in trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting was muted in H2:2018-19. Commercial vehicle sales \u2013 a lead indicator for road transport \u2013 plummeted due to rising fuel prices and relaxation of axle norms4. Other indicators for the transport sub-segment, viz., railway freight traffic and cargo handled at major ports, also decelerated in H2 (Chart III.21a). The growth of financial, real estate and professional services continued to accelerate with high frequency indicators of financial services extending their strong performance into Q4, supported by higher growth in personal loans and credit to the services sector as also the favourable base effect for aggregate deposits (Chart III.21b). Among the other key constituents that provided support to services growth, PADO accelerated in H2:2018-19 due to higher value added by the states in the form of revenue expenditure (excluding interest payments).

As the output gap is an unobserved macroeconomic variable, considerable uncertainty exists about its true value, which poses a challenge for policy making. The uncertainty stems from large data revisions and the difficulty in distinguishing between cycle and trend in real time. Acknowledging these issues, a pragmatic approach is employed for assessing output gap estimates, combining eclectic methodologies, including different univariate filters \u2013 Hodrick- Prescott (HP); Baxter-King (BK); Christiano-Fitzgerald (CF); and multivariate Kalman filters (MVKF) taking into account inflation dynamics and financial factors, to derive a proximate view. This composite estimate suggests that a slight negative output gap opened in Q3 (Chart III.23a). This reflects deceleration in the pace of domestic demand, with real GDP growth decelerating from 8.1 per cent in Q4:2017-18 to 6.6 per cent in Q3:2018-19. However, the finance-neutral output gap (FNOG) \u2013 which factors in the behaviour of key financial variables such as bank credit, equity prices and policy repo rate \u2013 remained virtually closed in Q3:2018-19 (Chart III.23b). are likely to improve demand, particularly in the its potential level expressed as a ratio of potential output) provides a summary measure of demand- The deceleration in economic activity which had set in during Q2, became entrenched in Q3.

First, forward, several risks appear private consumption is expected to get a fillip from measures such as public spending in rural areas, and increase in disposable income of households due to income tax benefits. Second, resolution of stressed assets and plateauing of the level of non- performing advances (NPAs) on banking balance sheets are expected to improve credit flows, which augur well for improving economic activity. Third, improving capacity utilisation, tailwinds from lower oil prices and a policy rate cut in February are all likely to support economic activity. Nevertheless, several downside risks persist, both on the domestic and global fronts. The slowing down of the global economy may impact prospects of India\u2019s exports. This risk may accentuate if trade tensions remain unresolved. Investment has been supported largely by government-led infrastructure spending. The key is to boost private investment across sectors, which will support demand in the short run, while boosting India\u2019s growth potential over the medium-term. In the second half of 2018-19, financial market conditions were characterised by systemic liquidity needs being met through a mix of liquidity injection instruments with the weighted average call money rate (WACR) trading close to the policy rate in February-March; stock markets moving sideways though they rallied in March; bond yields tracking domestic developments and global spillovers; and the Indian Rupee appreciating due to easing of global crude prices and resumption of foreign portfolio inflows. Credit offtake continued to be buoyant with some moderation in interest rates on new loans since February 2019. Global financial market sentiment turned cautious during H2:2018-19 in the wake of rising trade tensions, concerns about a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit and signs of slowing down of the global economy. Increased risk aversion and dovish monetary policy stances contributed to a decline in sovereign yields in the US, Germany and the UK. Credit spreads widened for corporate bonds in advanced economies (AEs) reflecting receding growth optimism, while equity valuations got trimmed as confidence diminished about earnings prospects. In the first quarter of 2019, equity markets in emerging market economies (EMEs) generally gained against the backdrop of waning trade tensions and country-specific factors. Despite the US Fed\u2019s softer monetary policy stance from January 2019, the US$ retained an appreciating bias vis-\u00e0-vis other major AE currencies. Divergent movements were observed in various segments of the domestic financial market as they reacted differently to the evolving global and local developments during H2:2018-19. In the overnight money market, interest rates remained close to the policy repo rate in February and March 2019 as the Reserve Bank injected liquidity through a mix of instruments. Yields on Treasury Bills (T-bills) moved in sync with longer tenor G-sec yields in response to global spillovers as well as domestic developments including (i) large infusion of liquidity through open market purchase operations; and (ii) large borrowing programme of the government announced in the Interim Budget 2019-20. Yields on corporate bonds broadly moved in line with those on government bonds. Equity markets moved sideways, but rallied sharply in March 2019. The exchange rate of the Indian Rupee (INR) traded with an appreciating bias as moderation in international crude oil prices, a dovish US Fed policy stance, waning trade tensions and the resumption of capital flows, buoyed appetite for emerging market assets. Credit flows from banks continued to improve and became increasingly broad-based. In response to a 25 bps reduction in the policy repo rate on February 7, 2019, some banks have reduced their lending rates under the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) system. In the overnight money market, the weighted average call rate (WACR) generally remained below the policy repo rate during H2:2018-19, although it got increasingly aligned with the policy repo rate in February and March. The spread of the WACR over the policy rate moved in sync with the evolving liquidity conditions. As the liquidity conditions tightened, the spread narrowed in H2:2018-19 vis-a-vis H1 (see Section IV.3 for details). The volatility (standard deviation) of the WACR reduced to 0.1 per cent in H2:2018-19 from 0.2 per cent in H1. Other overnight money market rates moved in tandem with the WACR. The introduction of the triparty repo, which replaced the erstwhile Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation (CBLO) from November 5, 2018, has ensured a level playing field in the money market as the triparty repo is exempted from maintenance of the cash reserve ratio (CRR), like the market repo, thereby obviating the sharp drops in CBLO rates on reporting Fridays. During H2:2018- 19, the triparty repo and market repo rates remained below the WACR by 7 bps and 1 bps, respectively. During H2:2018-19, volumes have shifted somewhat from the market repo to call money and the triparty repo. The share of call and the triparty repo increased to 12.3 per cent and 65.7 per cent, respectively, in March 2019 from 8.2 per cent and 62.0 per cent, respectively, in October 2018 (before the introduction of the triparty repo). The share of the market repo declined from 29.8 per cent to 22.0 per cent during the same period (Chart IV.1). Interest rates on longer tenor money market instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial papers (CPs) and 91-day Treasury Bills (T-bills) generally moved in sync during H2:2018-19 (Chart IV.2). After remaining elevated in September due to tight liquidity conditions, the 3-month T-bill rate softened in October mainly due to infusion of durable liquidity through OMOs. Rates on 3-month CPs and 3-month CDs eased in November, tracking T-bill rates. In Q3:2018-19, CP, CD and T-bill rates declined by 70 bps, 53 bps and 24 bps, respectively. These rates softened by 15 bps, 21 bps and 21 bps, respectively, on February 8, 2019 consequent to the policy repo rate reduction. Though T-bill rates continued to decline in Q4, 3-month CD and 3-month CP rates hardened by 31 bps and 23 bps, respectively, in anticipation of tightening of liquidity conditions in March 2019 due to the usual financial year-end effects. Fresh issuances of CDs increased to \u20b93,030 billion during H2:2018-19 (up to March 15, 2019) as compared with \u20b92,482 billion during the corresponding period of 2017-18. Issuances of CPs declined marginally to \u20b912,383 in billion H2:2017-18 mainly due to heightened risk aversion Infrastructure Leasing & Financial post the (IL&FS) debt event. Primary Services Limited issuances of CPs, which declined from September 2018 consequent to a series of rating downgrades of IL&FS and its associated companies, started recovering from November (Chart IV.3a) led by non- bank financial companies (NBFCs) and non-bank private corporates (Chart IV.3b). Interest rates in the primary CP market, which hardened from August until mid-November, softened thereafter by about 35 At the beginning of H2:2018-19, benchmark yields increased by 12 bps due to concerns about exchange market pressures. Yields softened by 13 bps in early October as the RBI maintained status quo on the policy rate, which surprised the market, and this downward movement was reinforced by the decline in international crude prices. Yields shed this softness, however, and spiked by 10 bps on October 9, 2018 as the INR depreciation sparked fears of a large sell-off by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). These concerns abated as the rupee recovered after India\u2019s trade deficit for September fell to its lowest level in five months, followed by an announcement of open market purchases by the RBI. Lower inflation prints accompanied by a sharp decline in crude oil prices resulted in a decline in yields by 10 bps during the first half of November. On November 16, yields rebounded by 6 bps on the back of a sharp rise in oil prices. On November 22 and November 28, yields fell by 8 bps and 9 bps, respectively, due to (i) a continuing fall in crude oil prices; and (ii) buoyed sentiments after the announcement of multiple open market purchases by the RBI till end-December. During December 2018, yields on the benchmark paper fell by 24 bps to 7.37 per cent, notwithstanding intermittent hardening because of fears about fiscal slippages on account of the farm relief package and an expected rise in market borrowing during 2019-20. Overall, the benchmark yield fell by 65 bps during Q3:2018-19. The benchmark yield rose by 11 bps during January 2019 amidst deteriorating market sentiments sparked by (i) concerns about the fiscal position of the central government; and (ii) a rise in crude oil prices due to the crude oil production cuts by Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and others. It moderated by end-January 2019 due to absence of details on widely expected farm relief package from the centre. The announcement of additional borrowing of \u20b91,390 billion for 2019-20 over and above the revised estimate of 2018-19 in the Interim Budget 2019-20 led to a firming up of the yield on the new benchmark paper (7.26% GS 2029) by 9 bps to 7.38 per cent and the old benchmark paper (7.17% GS 2028) by 13 bps to 7.61 per cent. Nevertheless, the reduction in the repo rate by the Reserve Bank, which was unanticipated by the market, and the downward revision of the projected inflation trajectory for April to September 2019 resulted in a decline in the new benchmark by 4 bps to 7.32 per cent and the old benchmark by 7 bps to 7.50 per cent. Furthermore, expectations of another rate cut in April, triggered by the CPI falling to its nineteenth month low of 2.1 per cent (provisional) in January 2019, led to a decline in the benchmark yield1. New and old benchmark yields, however, hardened by 12 bps and 13 bps, securities (Chart IV.4). Yields during March was steady with a softening bias on expectations of monetary The yield curve underwent a level shift in H2:2018- reduction in the repo rate in February resulted in a From October 2018 till March 2019, FPIs made net purchases of \u20b950.5 billion in the debt segment, of which state development loans (SDLs) constituted In October 2018 and January 2019, FPIs remained net sellers in the G-sec market, but they turned net \u20b90.2 billion. During March, FPIs made net purchases amounting to \u20b9339.8 billion in the equity segment 1 The new benchmark yield fell by 7 bps to 7.29 per cent and the old benchmark fell by 7 bps to 7.47 per cent. At the shorter end of the primary market segment, yields on T-Bills tracked the benchmark yield and hardened at the beginning of H2:2018-19 but they regained a softening bias in February on declining crude oil prices and the reduction in the policy repo rate (Chart IV.7). During March, yields on T-Bills softened on expectations of further rate cut, improvment in liquidity conditions due to open market operations and USD/INR buy/sell swap auction. At the longer end, the issuance of SDLs increased during H2:2018-19. The weighted average spread of SDLs\u2019 cut-off rate over G-sec yield increased to 65 bps in H2:2018-19 from 54 bps in H1:2018-19 (Chart IV.8). The average inter-state spread on securities of 10- year tenor was higher at 7.5 bps during H2:2018-19 as against 4 bps in H1:2018-19. Corporate bond yields largely tracked G-sec yields during H2:2018-19. The AAA 5-year corporate bond yields softened by 76 bps from 8.86 per cent at end- September 2018 to 8.10 per cent at end-March 2019 (Chart IV.9a). Despite the softening, however, the G-sec yield increased by 58 bps during the period, to \u20b92.2 trillion at end-March 2019 from \u20b92.0 trillion at end-September 2018, with sizeable investments reflecting increased credit risk premia in the aftermath of the IL&FS episode and liquidity squeeze faced by corporate bonds increased to 75.9 per cent at end- Consequent to the Reserve Bank\u2019s announcement to inject rupee liquidity through long-term foreign yield and the spread declined sharply. Credit default swap (CDS) spreads on State Bank of India and ICICI The Indian equity market, which was buoyant till Bank papers declined during the period.

The softening of corporate bond yields encouraged corporates to got exacerbated in October as market sentiment was dented by the liquidity tightness in the NBFC sector, coupled with global trade tensions. The market staged resort to increased bond issuance in December 2018 and January 2019, although it moderated in February due to easing of liquidity concerns in the NBFC sector. Since then, markets have exhibited two-way issuances of corporate bonds in the primary market increased by 42.0 per cent to \u20b92.99 trillion during October 2018 - February 2019 from \u20b92.11 trillion a year ago (Chart IV.9b). movements (Chart IV.10.a), but rallied sharply in the month of March 2019 leading to India outperforming corporate bond market (98.6 per cent) continued to be Investments by FPIs in corporate bonds increased concerns relating to trade tensions between the US 2019-20 and domestic monetary policy contributed and widening of India\u2019s current account deficit for to the rally.

Based on an assessment of financial market conditions, the RBI increased the Facility to Avail Liquidity for Liquidity which supplemented the ability of individual banks to avail liquidity from the repo market against high- quality collateral. Furthermore, it was decided to reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) by 25 bps every calendar quarter until it reaches 18 per cent of NDTL to align the SLR with the liquidity coverage ratio bps became effective from the quarter commencing January 2019, lowering the SLR to 19.25 per cent of The RBI Act, 1934 amended in 2016 requires the RBI to place the operating procedure relating to the of increase in Currency in Circulation (CiC) was the main driver of liquidity in H2:2018-19.

Weekly expansion in CiC of \u20b9494 billion around Diwali (November 7, 2018) was unprecedented (Chart IV.26). During Q4, CiC expanded by \u20b91,147 billion, taking the total expansion in CiC to \u20b92,144 billion in H2. meet liquidity needs, the RBI conducted variable rate repo auctions of longer tenors (28-56-day) in addition to the regular 14-day repos. Additionally, durable liquidity of \u20b9360 billion was injected through OMOs in October 2018, which was subsequently scaled up to \u20b9500 billion each in November and December, taking the total durable liquidity injection to \u20b91,360 billion (through twelve auctions) during the quarter (Chart IV.27). Expansion in CiC is driven largely by macroeconomic factors such as nominal GDP growth and interest rates over the medium term. In the short term, however, it is also influenced by seasonal factors such as festivals and idiosyncratic factors like demonetisation and elections (Box IV.1). Deficit liquidity conditions persisted in Q4:2018-19 build-up of government cash balances, barring a few when liquidity conditions were in surplus as the In the second week of October, a large increase in currency demand and RBI\u2019s forex sales resulted in a systemic liquidity deficit, which continued for the rest of the month. With the Government resorting to ways and means advances (WMA) to finance higher spending, the deficit moderated at the beginning of November but increased subsequently because of higher currency expansion during the festival season. The liquidity deficit increased in the second half of December mainly due to advance tax outflows. To government resorted to overdraft (OD)/ways and means advances (WMA). To meet durable liquidity needs, the RBI conducted OMO purchases of \u20b9500 billion in January, \u20b9375 billion in February and \u20b9250 billion in March. Simultaneously, transient liquidity needs were met through variable rate repos of various Sporadic instances of excess liquidity were managed Globally, central banks estimate and forecast currency movements for liquidity management operations (Khatat, 2018). The demand for currency at the aggregate level is estimated at both the quarterly and monthly frequency to distinguish between the long-term and short-term determinants3. In the long run, the demand for currency depends upon key macroeconomic variables (e.g., nominal GDP, interest rates, etc.) which enables identification of shifts in currency demand over time. In the short- run, the demand for currency is mainly driven by seasonal factors (including festival demand) and some idiosyncratic factors (for instance, elections), the patterns of which could be identified from historical data (Nachane et al., 2013; Bhattacharya and Singh, 2018). To understand the long-run relationship between the demand for currency in circulation and its major macroeconomic determinants such as output and the interest rate, empirical analysis is undertaken using quarterly data spanning Q2:1998 to Q3:2018. Both currency and gross domestic product are converted into logarithmic form. Dummies are used to capture the impact of festivals and demonetisation. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model was used, keeping in view the different orders of integration of the data series (Pesaran et al., 2001), with the following specification (Raj et al., 2019): income elasticity of currency demand is marginally above unity during the period under consideration (Table IV.1.1). As expected, currency demand is negatively related to ADR, although the effect is muted (though statistically significant). Apart from these fundamental variables, currency demand is influenced by several frictional factors such as festivals, elections and one-off events such as demonetisation. Finally, the short-run dynamics captured by the error correction term indicate that the speed of adjustment to any shock is significant, i.e., around 28 per cent of the deviation gets adjusted in the following quarter. To check the empirical regularity of this phenomenon at a higher frequency, a model using monthly data for the period April 2004 to December 2018 was estimated through an autoregressive process to control for persistence in currency demand. Dummies representing festivals/elections and demonetisation were also used in the following specification: \u0394(LCiC)t = a + b * \u0394(LCiC)t-1 + bi * \u22110 where the growth in Log of CiC (m-o-m, per cent) represent the dependent variable, Ei represent a dummy variable for the i th month before general \u0394(LCiC)t = a* (LCiC \u2013 b * LNGDP \u2013 c * ADR \u2013 \u2211 d * D_DEMO - \u2211 ej * D_FEST)t-i + \u2211 fi * \u0394(LCiCt-i ) + \u2211 gi * \u0394(LNGDPt-i ) + \u2211 hi * \u0394(ADRt-i ) + \u2211 ii * \u0394(D_DEMOt- i ) + \u2211 ji * \u0394(D_FESTt-i ) + \u03b5t \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(1) where, CiC is currency in circulation NGDP is nominal gross domestic product ADR is average deposit rate D_DEMO is the dummy for demonetisation D_FEST is the dummy for festivals Error correction (-1) Adjusted R-squared F-Statistics Lower and upper bound critical value Q-statistic The long-run relationship between the demand for currency and its determinants indicates that the Note: Figures in parentheses indicate p-value.

As expected, CiC picks up during the festival months of October/ November (Dussehra and Diwali). The robustness of both the models is evident from the plot of the actual and the estimated values derived from both quarterly and monthly models (Chart IV.1.1). elections, E0 is the dummy for the month in which general elections were held and Ej represents a dummy in the jth month after the general elections. The growth in currency demand is found to exhibit some persistence (Table IV.1.2). Regression coefficients for the monthly dummies before the general elections were positive (but statistically insignificant), while they were found to be positive and statistically significant during election months, suggesting an increase in currency demand during those months. Post-election month dummies, however, turned out to be to be negative (and statistically significant) indicating the return of CiC to the banking system. Dk representing Nachane, D. M., A. B.

To sum up, the RBI\u2019s forex operations and currency expansion were the prime drivers of durable liquidity spending was the key driver of frictional liquidity movements. Since the Reserve Bank regularly injected mirrored largely movements in government cash Movements in government cash balances are directly reflected in LAF positions on most occasions. While drawdown of cash balances by the government resulted in surplus liquidity, which was absorbed through reverse repo under the LAF window, the build-up of government cash balances resulted in deficit, which was managed through repo operations (Table 1V.4). The temporary mismatches between receipts and payments of the government during H2:2018-19 were met through its recourse to cash management bills (CMBs) on four occasions of maturity ranging 12-59 days aggregating \u20b91,050 billion. Surplus (reverse repo) Fine-tuning operations through variable rate auctions was another defining feature of liquidity management during H2:2018-19. Large liquidity injections were made through repo auctions of maturities ranging from overnight to 56 days, while reverse repos of maturities ranging from overnight to 7 days were frequently used for absorbing liquidity (Table IV.5). The evolution of liquidity conditions and their management by the RBI gets encapsulated in the movement of bank reserves, which evolve largely through the dynamic interaction between the central bank and depository institutions. If liquidity pressures from autonomous drivers of liquidity are not fully (more than) offset by liquidity management measures, they are reflected in drawdown (accumulation) of bank reserves. An analytical scrutiny of the liquidity drivers and their management during 2018-19 provides some interesting insights. During H2:2018- 19, liquidity withdrawal through autonomous drivers was more than offset through liquidity management operations. Consequently, there was an increase in bank reserves unlike H1 (Table IV.6). Thus, an aggregate picture of bank reserves for the full year may not be reflective of intra-year liquidity dynamics. repo rate. In H2:2018-19, the WACR generally traded below the policy repo rate during October-January but hardended intermittenly thereafter and spiked at the year-end (Chart IV.30). During H2:2018-19, the negative spread of the WACR over the repo rate increased from 5 bps in October to 12 bps in January (Chart IV.31). Post announcement of reduction in the repo rate by 25 bps on February 7, 2019, however, the WACR aligned closer to the repo rate in February and March. Overall, the WACR, on average, remained 6 bps below the policy repo rate in H2 as against 10 bps in H1:2018-19.

First, most of the co- operative banks are not participants in the NDS- Call trading platform. Non-scheduled co-operative banks, district central co-operative banks and state co-operative banks tend to enter the inter-bank call market late in the trading hours after the closure of the collateralised market segments. They are normally lenders and drive overnight rates below the repo rate. Second, the first hour of trading in the inter-bank call market usually accounts for about 75- 80 per cent of the day\u2019s volume as most of the market participants are unable to assess their inflows/ outflows for the day in the absence of a robust liquidity forecasting framework in their treasuries; consequently, late-hour demand supply mismatches often reflect in low call rates. Third, market hours vary across all money market segments (including the collateralised segments) and they are also not in sync with real time gross settlement (RTGS) timings, which often have some impact on the WACR towards the market\u2019s closure. Number of days* In view of the increased liquidity demand every year in March due to a variety of year-end factors, the Reserve Bank decided to conduct four longer term variable rate repo auctions (tenor ranging between 14-day and 56-day) during the month in addition to the regular 14-day variable rate term repo auctions. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank decided to augment its liquidity management toolkit and inject rupee liquidity for longer duration through long-term foreign exchange buy/sell swaps. Accordingly, it conducted a US$/` buy/sell swap auction of US$ 5 billion for tenor of 3 years on March 26, 2019, to inject durable liquidity of `345.6 billion into the system. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank announced another buy/sell swap auction of US$ 5 billion for tenor of 3 years to be conducted on April 23, 2019. to be Domestic financial markets continued influenced by global developments, especially volatile capital flows. The direction of capital flows remains unpredictable, posing challenges for macroeconomic and liquidity management. The exuberance in the equity market in H1:2018-19 generally continued in H2:2018-19, barring some bearishness in October, January and February. Credit growth has been healthy, notwithstanding some deceleration in recent months. Going forward, liquidity operations would continue to focus on achieving the stated policy objective of aligning the WACR with the policy repo rate by meeting the durable liquidity needs of the economy. Adequate and swift monetary transmission remains a policy challenge for the Reserve Bank. Global growth has lost pace led by deceleration in major advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs). Ongoing trade tensions have clouded the world trade outlook. Inflation pressures across geographies have remained muted. Financial markets, which ended 2018 on a volatile note, witnessed revival of risk-on sentiment in Q1:2019 on accommodative policy stances and benign oil prices. Since increasing apprehensions over a sharper than anticipated growth slowdown in the US, China and the Euro area have risen on incoming macroeconomic and financial data. Announcements of policy stimulus by China and accommodative monetary policy stances adopted by key central banks have provided some relief, along with hopes of a positive outcome from the US-China trade negotiations. Global financial markets ended 2018 on a volatile note, after a steep sell-off in risk assets. Risk-on sentiment revitalised in Q1:2019 on accommodative policy stances and benign oil prices even as the demand for safe haven assets has remained resilient in the face of the possibility of a hard/no-deal Brexit and geo-political challenges. entered into technical recession (contraction in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters) in Q4:2018. The slowdown in the Euro area has carried over into Q1:2019. The manufacturing PMI slipped further into contraction in Q1 on falling export orders. The outlook remains clouded by tariffs on the automobile sector and uncertainty surrounding the Brexit. The Japanese economy returned to growth in Q4:2018, after contracting in Q3, on the back of a rebound in household consumption and business investment. However, the latest data on manufacturing activity Among the major AEs, the US economy slowed during Q4:2018, pulled down mainly by private consumption as reflected in slowing retail sales. The slowdown appears to have continued in Q1:2019. The US manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) fell further in March 2019, pointing to the slowest growth in factory activity since June 2017 amidst weak demand, rising uncertainty across manufacturing supply chains, and an uncertain global trade outlook (Table V.1). Consumer sentiment, however, improved in Q1 on favourable real income expectations and the statement by the US Fed that it would be patient in future adjustments in the policy rate. The Euro area economy ended 2018 on a tepid note due to muted industrial activity and soft domestic demand. Among its key constituent economies, while Germany managed to register flat growth, Italy lost and retail sales suggest that growth has momentum in Q1. Economic activity is expected to continue its moderate expansion in 2019, supported by an accommodative monetary policy stance and frontloaded consumer spending ahead of a planned sales tax hike. December 2018. Economic recovery in Brazil was proceeding at a slower pace than earlier envisaged amidst positive political developments and pension reforms. During Q1:2019, incoming data suggests that economic activity remained weak on both domestic and external headwinds. Economic activity slowed in some major EMEs in Q4:2018 on the back of slowing industrial activity resulting from subdued global demand. The Chinese economy decelerated in Q4 on subdued domestic and global demand impacting industrial activity. Retail sales lost steam due to financial deleveraging and slowing global growth. Incoming data suggest that much of this weakness in economic activity extended into Q1:2019 as manufacturing activity remained subdued with factory output growth of 5.3 per cent in January-February turning out to be the weakest reading since the data series began in 1995. Fiscal stimulus and easing liquidity conditions, however, could buttress domestic demand, going forward. Elsewhere in Asia, economic activity remained somewhat mixed. In Thailand, growth recovered during Q4:2018 from a contraction in the previous quarter, although subdued retail sales and weak industrial activity remained soft spots. Growth recuperated in Malaysia in Q4 as slowing inflation boosted consumption. The Indonesian economy lost pace in Q4 with retail sales falling and exports slumping. The Turkish economy entered into recession in Q4:2018 after a tumultuous year \u2013 a currency crisis amidst a challenging political situation. The outlook for the economy remains uncertain as inflation, though falling, remains well above the target. In Russia, incoming data suggest that the economy was showing some signs of recovery in Q1 as reflected by the uptick in retail sales and industrial production. South Africa emerged from recession in Q3:2018, though industrial production ended 2018 on a soft patch and retail sales contracted in The global composite PMI registered a mild gain in February \u2013 after declining to 28-month low in January \u2013 on improved growth in services (Chart V.1a). Among the major OECD economies, composite leading indicators (CLIs) suggest slowing of growth momentum in major AEs and EMEs in Q4:2018, barring Brazil (Chart V.1b). Global trade growth slowed down in Q4:2018, though an increase in commodity prices partly offset the deceleration in volumes. AEs and EMEs have both been impacted by the slowdown in trade, though the loss of momentum is somewhat higher for EMEs (Chart V.2a). In line with recent trends, forward looking indicators suggest that world trade is likely to slow down further in 2019. The World Trade Outlook Indicator (WTOI)1 has slipped below trend, following a slowdown in the past four quarters. All major components such as export orders, international air freight and automobile production have suffered loss of momentum. Movement in other indicators such as the Baltic Dry Index also suggests a moderation in global trade (Chart V.2b), with ongoing trade tensions clouding the outlook. declined in November 2018 to their lowest levels in more than two years. They, however, firmed up in Q1, buoyed by prices of many food items, especially dairy products, due to tightening export supplies on account of a seasonal decline in production and robust import demand. Rising international sugar prices due to concerns over production prospects and appreciation of the Brazilian real also added to the rise in the food price index (Chart V.3a). Brent crude price declined sharply by 20.7 per cent between October 2018 and March 2019 on mounting oil inventories in the US and on the back of slowing global demand. Crude prices recovered somewhat from their December lows in Q1:2019 (Chart V.3b). The outlook for crude oil prices, however, remains uncertain (Box V.1). Global commodity prices have been largely driven by demand-supply factors, geo-political concerns and trade tensions. The Bloomberg commodity index declined by 6.1 per cent between October 2018 and March 2019. The food price index of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) increased by 2.8 per cent between October 2018 and February 2019. Global food prices Base metal prices, measured by the Bloomberg base metal spot index, increased by 3.2 per cent between October 2018 and March 2019. Base metal prices witnessed selling pressures in Q4:2018 on global trade uncertainty, but recovered most of the losses in Q1:2019 on supply disruptions and expectations of positive outcome from trade negotiations. Copper prices seemed to be firming up on concerns over tighter supply and increasing demand, after remaining low in Q4:2018 due to trade tensions and slowing 1 The World Trade Outlook Indicator combines a variety of trade-related indices to provide an early signal of the current direction of world trade and where it is likely to go in the near future. Global crude oil price movements have been volatile in 2018 and 2019 so far. Brent crude oil price, which was at around US$ 69 per barrel in January 2018, moved up to around US$ 80 per barrel by October 2018 before collapsing to US$ 56 per barrel in December 2018. It recovered to around US$ 68 per With robust global demand and OPEC plus2 countries\u2019 production cuts in force, crude oil inventories slipped below their long-term averages from early 2018 onwards, leading to a sharp upturn in international crude oil prices to above US$ 80 per barrel in October. Speculative interest in crude also increased significantly during this period. Thereafter, in a matter of two months beginning mid-October, all the gains in prices between October 2017 and mid-October 2018 were reversed under the combined impact of record US shale oil production, OPEC over-production during the latter part of 2018 and significant slowdown in global demand, tilting the global oil balance to oversupply. Reflecting these developments, a sharp backwardation3 in the futures market for crude oil which was seen at the beginning of 2018 shifted to contango4 during November-December 2018. This was coupled with heightened implied and historical volatility of crude oil prices (Chart V.1.1). With the reduction in OPEC crude oil supplies in line with the Vienna agreement of December 20185, prices reversed in 2019 in (Contd...) 2 OPEC plus refers to the OPEC nations along with non-OPEC countries namely Russia that have agreed to cap crude oil production at pre-determined levels. 3 Backwardation in commodity futures markets refers to a situation when the price of a near-term contract is higher than the price for forward deliveries. Backwardation occurs when supply shortage pushes up spot or near-term prices but prices on the further end of the futures curve remains steady due to anticipation of higher supplies in further ahead. (Source: http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=backwardation). 4 Contango in commodity futures markets refers to a situation when the price of a spot or near-term contract is lower than the price for a futures contract at the longer end of the curve. (Source: http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=contango). 5 Under this agreement about 1.3 mb/d of crude would be 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d) off the market for the first six months of 2019 with the share of OPEC production cuts being 0.8 mb/d and those of non-OPEC participating countries being 0.4 mb/d.

As crude prices started to pick up, implied volatility in crude oil markets has shown a substantial moderation since mid-January 2019. Historically, the prices of crude oil have been influenced mainly by three factors, viz., (i) the demand-supply balance; (ii) crude oil inventory levels; and (iii) the speculative interest in crude oil (Hamilton, 2008; Juvenal and Petrella, 2015). This is corroborated by an analysis on determinants of Brent prices based on monthly data from January 2011 to February 2019. The following equations were estimated to identify the determinants of Brent crude oil prices: t = b0+ b1 \u03b52 \u03c32 Where \u0394P is the annualised per cent change in Brent crude oil price; \u0394I is the annualised per cent change in global inventory; NS is net supply (global crude oil supply \u2013 global crude oil demand); Spec is the annualised per cent change in net long speculative positions in Brent market; pmi is the The empirical estimates suggest that any increase in global inventory tends to significantly reduce crude oil prices. As expected, the net supply balance also affects prices negatively. On the other hand, an increase in aggregate demand significantly increases crude oil prices. Further, any increase in speculative activity in the market also tends to increase prices. The volatility in Brent prices is determined by the quantum of speculative activity in markets. While both large exits and entries increase the variability in prices, the speculative entry has a larger impact on the volatility. Going into 2019, the key factor from the point of view of demand supply balance would be the staying power of the OPEC agreement on production cuts. Compliance with recent OPEC production cuts has been as high as 94 per cent6, with reports7 that OPEC is likely to extend production cuts well into 2019 in its meeting scheduled for April 2019. In addition to planned production cuts, the continuing worsening of geo-political tensions relating to Venezuela and sanctions on Iran\u2019s exports have impacted the sour global crude oil supply. Going forward, implementation of International Maritime the Organization\u2019s (IMO) 2020 global sulphur cap on shipping fuel would put additional pressure on sour grade crude oil. A combination of these factors is exerting pressure on global crude oil markets and is also resulting in a narrowing of price spreads 6 International Energy Agency (2019), \u201cOil Market Report -March\u201d, March 15. 7 Gamal, R E, Vladimir Soldatkin and Nailia Bagirova (2019), \u201cSaudi signals OPEC may need to extend oil cuts until end-2019\u201d, Reuters, March 18.

The outlook on crude oil supply in the near-term would also be contingent on the rate of increase in US shale oil production. The outlook is one of the US becoming a net exporter of crude by 2021 driven by shale oil (IEA, 2019). In the near-term, however, there are signs of a slowdown in the rate of increase in shale oil rigs as investors have turned cautious and remain focused more on cash flows. As fresh investment awaits further cues on the direction of prices, some tempering of the shale oil momentum may be expected in the immediate term. A significant factor impinging on the near-term outlook for crude oil prices is the global oil demand outlook. In 2019 so far, high frequency indicators suggest an increased appetite for commodities with energy indices generating the highest returns to date in 2019. The relationship between equity markets and commodities has also strengthened in the year so far8. Historically, the estimation results on determinants of crude oil prices show that increased financial interest in crude has significantly amplified the volatility in prices during times of large speculative interests and unwinding of such positions. Should there be a resolution of ongoing trade disputes, global demand prospects could brighten, leading to an uptick in crude oil prices. This, in turn, could result in sharp increases in net long speculative positions on crude futures, possibly further pulling up crude oil prices. On the other hand, concerns about the demand outlook, which has been rekindled with the inversion of the 10-year yield curve in the US9, could bring about sharp unwinding of long speculative positions, amplifying price declines. In a baseline case, a strong push by OPEC for higher prices, on the one hand, and the prospects of a massive response from shale oil producers, if prices pick up significantly on the other, may keep crude oil prices range-bound over the course of the year, as is also reflected in the professional forecasters\u2019 median estimates and the futures curve (Chart V.1.3).

However, inflation inched up slightly in February with increase in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages. In South Africa, the inflation rate has eased in Q1 on falling energy prices. In Russia, inflation reached its highest level in two years in February at around 5 per cent due to increased value added tax and weaker rouble. In Indonesia, inflation remained below the target of 3.5 per cent through Q4:2018 to touch its lower bound in March due to deflation in administered prices. Inflation in Turkey has fallen consistently since October 2018 on ebbing domestic and global headwinds, along with a tight monetary policy stance. consistently since October 2018 on the back of falling energy prices and weak growth. In Japan, inflation eased to 0.2 per cent (y-o-y) in February 2019, pulled down by falling food, transport and housing prices (Chart V.5a). Inflationary pressures are easing in many EMEs (Chart V.5b). China\u2019s consumer price inflation fell to 1.5 per cent in February 2019 due to subdued international and domestic demand on the back of lingering uncertainty over the US-China trade negotiations. In Brazil, inflation has fallen since October 2018 due to Monetary becoming accommodative in most AEs and EMEs in the face of a slowing global economy and persisting US- China trade frictions. The US Fed left the policy rate unchanged at 2.25-2.50 per cent in its meetings in 2019 so far after raising it four times in 2018 and indicated that it would be patient in future rate adjustments (Chart V.6a). The European Central Bank (ECB) kept its key interest rates unchanged against the backdrop of growing downside risks to the economic outlook. In March 2019, the ECB announced targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO- III) starting in September 2019 and ending in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years, reflecting its is concerns about the growth outlook, and indicated to maintain policy rates at low levels, at least through the end of 2019. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) continued with its highly accommodative monetary policy stance in Q1 as it cut its inflation forecasts in January 2019 on expectations of weakening economic activity due to a consumption tax hike to be implemented in October 2019. Monetary policy stances in many EMEs are also turning more accommodative with moderation in inflation pressures resulting from lower oil prices and weak demand. Among BRICS countries, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) maintained its \u201cprudent and neutral\u201d policy stance and indicated more forward- looking, flexible and targeted policy reactions. In order to boost lending, the PBOC eased reserve requirements ratio and adjusted the assessment criteria of loans to small and medium enterprises in January 2019. Brazil kept its policy rate unchanged in February-March. Russia, after hiking its policy rate in December, left it unchanged in Q1:2019. South Africa kept its policy rate unchanged in Q1, after increasing it in November. Among other EMEs, Mexico raised its policy rate twice in Q4:2018 on rising inflation risks and uncertainty around economic policies by the new government. However, it kept its policy rate unchanged during Q1. Chile raised its policy rate twice during October-January, responding to the regained dynamism in economic activity. However, it kept the policy rate unchanged in its March meeting due to moderation of inflation. Indonesia kept its policy rate unchanged in Q1. The Philippines kept its policy rate unchanged on moderating growth and inflation expectations in Q1 (Chart V.6b). Financial markets, which had barely recovered from the impact of currency market pressures in EMEs in August 2018, were unsettled by a renewed bout of volatility as equities witnessed a sell-off in Q4:2018 on adverse macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Investors faced several disconcerting developments including strengthening of the US dollar, trade disputes and sanctions. The economic policy uncertainty index was also on an upswing during Q4 on hostile economic and political developments (Chart V.7). However, some of these headwinds ebbed and markets entered 2019 on a relatively calmer note as central banks signalled accommodation and expectations of a resolution of the China-US trade conflict gained traction. Global equity prices witnessed selling pressures during Q4:2018, with equity markets in both the advanced and emerging economies declining sharply due to a series of events such as spike in bond yields, triggered by Fed tightening, persistent trade frictions and political uncertainty in Europe. US stocks corrected in October, pulled down by the technology index despite better earnings due to the concerns over economic slowdown and trade tensions. Among and an accommodative monetary policy stance by the Fed. Equity markets in the US strengthened, reversing most of December\u2019s losses. European equities rose as global markets rallied, but enthusiasm was dulled by soft economic data, Brexit and Italy\u2019s economic woes. Japanese equities firmed up in tandem with global equities, but mixed economic data and downgrade to the inflation outlook by the Bank of Japan weighed on investor sentiment and capped gains. Stock markets in the EMEs gained in Q1 driven by country-specific factors against the background of a less hostile global environment as key central banks paused policy rate hikes. In Brazil, stocks surged on improved business sentiment and announcement of pension reforms. Chinese equities gained on positive developments on trade talks and domestic stimulus. Russian equities increased on strong gains in crude oil and the rouble in Q1 (Chart V.8). other AEs, the narrative remained broadly unchanged as markets tumbled on political tensions in Europe surrounding Italy and Brexit. A fall in crude oil prices and rise in the US dollar also contributed adversely to the risk-off sentiment in November. The sell-off in global equity markets continued till the end of Q4, reflecting market reactions to the possibility of a US government shutdown and general discontent surrounding the direction of the Fed\u2019s policy. However, reversing the situation, global equity markets recovered their losses during Q1:2019. Stocks in AEs registered impressive gains in January, rising by 7.7 per cent on improving outlook for US-China trade talks Bond yields edged lower during Q4:2018, reflecting risk aversion and volatility amidst increased tensions, Brexit uncertainty relating and political concerns in Italy. In the US, 10-year Treasury yields fell on dovish comments by the Fed. In Europe, bond yields fell on soft economic data, though the ECB confirmed in its December meeting that it would end the bond purchase programme. Japanese bonds yields fell significantly on weak risk appetite triggered by growth concerns and entered into negative territory in December 2018. In the US, bond yields continued to decline in Q1:2019 due to weak economic data and central banks adopting a more cautionary language, while bond yields in Japan fell deeper into negative territory after a brief uptick in January. In the Euro area, bond yields slipped into negative territory in March. Emerging markets bond yields fell as Q4 progressed, with easing inflation pressures, weaker energy prices, and soft monetary policy stances (Chart V.9a). The US dollar strengthened during much of Q4:2018 on a tighter monetary policy stance by the Fed and strong economic data, though it ended the quarter on a soft note, falling in December 2018 on expectations of a softer Fed stance in 2019. Much of the US dollar\u2019s weakness spilled into 2019 on the Fed\u2019s dovish monetary policy stance and weak manufacturing data, though it ended Q1 on bullish note due to relatively better performance of the US economy vis-a-vis its peers. Persisting trade tensions, coupled with fears of a global growth slowdown, contributed to the strengthening of the Japanese yen, though it lost some ground in Q1:2019 on soft data and buoyant risk appetite. The euro fell against the US dollar in Q4 due to continued fragility in some of the member countries, aggravated by political tensions surrounding Italy and Brexit during November, but staged a mild comeback in December on the US dollar\u2019s weakness. The euro failed to maintain the year-end momentum and witnessed selling pressures in Q1:2019 on fears of a broader slowdown in Europe. Most of the emerging market currencies emerged out of the downward pressure, experienced after the Turkish turmoil, trimming their past losses during the final quarter of 2018. They began 2019 on a bullish note as the Fed indicated an end to its rate normalisation cycle in conjunction with other positive events like soft crude prices, monetary easing by China and abating trade tensions, though it witnessed selling pressures in mid-February due to country-specific events and a weakening global growth outlook. Between October 2018 and March 2019, the JP Morgan emerging markets currency index increased by 0.5 per cent, though currencies are still trading below their levels witnessed in the summer of 2018 (Chart V.9b). In sum, global economic activity is witnessing a synchronised deceleration, though easy policy stances by the fiscal and monetary authorities in several economies are expected to cushion the pace of the slowdown. The global trade outlook is uncertain as the largest economies of the world struggle to strike a deal. Inflation pressures across geographies remain benign on soft commodity prices and slowing demand. Global growth and trade concerns are expected to remain the dominant theme of 2019, which will drive markets and condition future monetary and fiscal actions. ", "file14": "value of family labor used in production While domestic activity has continued to exhibit resilience and stability after the April 2018 Monetary Policy Report, the external environment has remained challenging and imparted downside risk to India\u2019s growth prospects. The soft headline inflation readings for July and August 2018 relative to projections imply a largely benign food prices outlook in the near term even as upside risks to inflation over the 12-month ahead horizon appear to be rising modestly due to global financial market volatility and surging oil prices. headline inflation readings for July and August 2018 relative to projections imply a largely benign food prices outlook in the near term; however, volatility in global financial markets and surging oil prices remain upside risks to inflation over the 12-month ahead horizon. These developments pose challenges for the setting of monetary policy in India. In the period following the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of April 2018, several risks it had flagged have been materialising on an ongoing basis. The global financial environment has macroeconomic and been roiled by bouts of financial market volatility, retaliatory among major economies of the world, elevated and volatile crude oil prices, and recurring jitters around the efficacy of managing monetary policy normalisation in the US amidst a late-in-the-cycle US fiscal stimulus, lashing emerging market occurring all at once, economies (EMEs) as an asset class with asset price shocks and capital outflows. More recently, vulnerabilities surfacing amongst specific EMEs have produced powerful contagion effects. Taken together, these global factors appear to be increasing risks around India\u2019s growth prospects over the next 12-month horizon with a slant to the downside. Global growth itself is getting differentiated across economies and the cyclical upswing in global trade that had started in Q4:2017 is being stifled by rising trade tensions. During April-August 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met thrice in accordance with its bi-monthly schedule. Maintaining status quo in its April 2018 meeting, the MPC increased the policy repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) successively in its June and August 2018 meetings. In its June 2018 meeting, the MPC\u2019s vote was unanimous against the backdrop of rising inflation, upward revision in inflation projections, sharper than anticipated increase in crude oil prices, and hardening of households\u2019 inflation expectations. In August, however, the MPC\u2019s vote was by a majority of 5:1. The decision by majority was influenced by further hardening of inflation expectations amidst uncertainty around the impact of the minimum support price (MSP) hikes. The MPC\u2019s voting pattern, which reflects differences in individual members\u2019 assessments and expectations as well as relative weights on policy goals, is also observed in other central banks (Table I.1). Meanwhile, domestic economic activity has continued to exhibit resilience and stability in these highly unsettled global conditions. On the agricultural front, the spatial distribution of south-west monsoon was somewhat skewed, although most of the kharif crop growing states received normal rainfall. Industrial activity has gathered pace and the outlook for the Inward services sector foreign direct investment remains buoyant.

The soft is gradually Chapters II and III analyse developments relating to prices and costs and demand and supply conditions during the first half of 2018-19, comparing outcomes versus forecasts and setting reasons underlying divergences. Turning to the outlook, developments in key macroeconomic variables over the past six months warrant revisions in the baseline assumptions (Table I.2). Notes: 1. The Indian basket of crude oil represents a derived numeraire comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil. First, international crude oil prices have firmed up by more than US$ 15 per barrel over the April 2018 MPR baseline assumption. Given the current demand- supply assessment and signals extracted from the futures market, the baseline scenario assumes crude oil prices (Indian basket) to average US$ 80 a barrel in the second half of 2018-19 (Chart I.1). Second, the exchange rate of the Indian rupee (INR) vis- \u00e0-vis the US dollar has depreciated from its end-March level, reflecting (i) the general strengthening of the US dollar across major currencies; (ii) higher crude oil prices widening the trade and current account deficits; y a d r e p s l e r r a b n o i l l i y a d r e p s l e r r a b n o i l l i l e r r a b r e p $ S U 6 1 - r p A 7 1 - r p A 8 1 - r p A 9 1 - r p A A broad-based uptick in inflation in respect of prices of fuel, transportation, personal care/effects, education and health services was largely offset by the unexpectedly and unseasonally benign food inflation (Chapter II). (iii) portfolio outflows; and (iv) risk aversion among portfolio investors towards EMEs after the country- specific developments in Turkey and Argentina. As on October 4, the INR had depreciated by 11.8 per cent against the US dollar from its level at end-March 2018. Third, global economic activity has expanded, broadly in line with the baseline projections given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in April (Chart I.2). However, it has become uneven and less synchronised across regions. Uncertainty has heightened on account of escalating protectionism and tariff wars, tightening of global financial conditions, and higher oil prices, all posing downside risks to global growth. The recovery in world trade is losing momentum.1 Looking ahead, it is useful to read into the signals emitted by inflation expectations of firms and households. By shaping price and wage setting behaviour, they influence future inflation. Inflation expectations also adapt to actual inflation outcomes of salient items such as food and fuel. Inflation expectations of urban households surveyed by the Reserve Bank exhibited a mixed picture in its September 2018 round2: they increased by 50 bps over the previous round for the three months ahead horizon and softened by 30 bps for the one year ahead horizon. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate, however, declined marginally in the September round for the three months ahead horizon and was almost unchanged for the one year ahead horizon (Chart I.3). Finally, the south-west monsoon rainfall (June- September 2018) was 9 per cent below long period average, vis-\u00e0-vis the baseline assumption of normal monsoon made in April. Headline consumer price inflation averaged 4.4 per cent during 2018-19 up to August [4.1 per cent, excluding the estimated impact of house rent allowances (HRAs) for central government employees]. Manufacturing firms polled in the July-September 2018 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey 2 The Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households is conducted in 18 cities and the results of the September 2018 survey are based on responses from 5,760 households. e t a r n o i t a l f n I Selling price Note: Net response is the difference between the respondents reporting optimism and those reporting pessimism. The range is - 100 to 100. An increase/decrease in net response in respect of the selling price is optimistic/pessimistic, while the increase/decrease in net response in respect of the cost of raw materials is pessimistic/optimistic from the view point of respondent firms. Therefore, higher negative values for the cost of raw materials indicate higher input price pressures and vice versa. expected higher cost of raw materials in Q3:2018-19 (Chart I.4).3 Consequently, respondents anticipated input prices to firm up further and muted profit margins in spite of higher selling prices. According to the Nikkei\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 survey, firms in both the manufacturing and services sectors raised output prices in September 2018 in the face of input cost pressures. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in September 2018 expected CPI inflation to fall from 4.8 per cent in Q1:2018-19 to 4.1 per cent in Q3 and then pick up to 5.1 per cent by Q2:2019-20 (Chart I.5).4 the increase in MSPs into retail inflation. The direct impact of the increase in HRA by central government has started waning and will fade away completely by December 2018. Excluding the estimated impact of HRA for central government employees, CPI inflation is projected at 3.8 per cent in Q3:2018-19 and 4.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4:2018-19 are 3.6-5.7 per cent and 3.1-6.4 per cent, respectively. Taking into account the initial conditions, signals from forward-looking surveys and estimates from structural and other models5, CPI inflation is projected to pick up from 3.7 per cent in August 2018 to 3.9 per cent in Q3:2018-19 and 4.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19, with risks somewhat tilted to the upside (Chart I.6). The projected increase in inflation from current levels reflects the waning away of favourable base effects and anticipates the feeding through of the impact of 3 The results of July-September 2018 round of the industrial outlook survey are based on responses from 1,095 companies. 4 29 panelists participated in the September 2018 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of professional forecasters. 5 A description of structural model is available in Benes, Jaromir, et al.

Source:RBIstaffestimates. For 2019-20, structural model estimates indicate that inflation will move in a range of 4.5-4.8 per cent, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous/ policy shocks. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for Q4:2019-20 are 3.4-6.3 per cent and 2.7-7.2 per cent, respectively. There are upside and downside risks to the baseline inflation path. As stated earlier, the announced increase in MSPs for kharif crops has been much bigger than in the recent past, but there is considerable uncertainty about the exact impact of the scale and timing of government procurement operations. Other upside risks in the context of the baseline projection include supply disruptions in the global crude oil market, volatility in international financial markets and second round effects of the staggered HRA revisions by state governments. A major downside risk to the baseline could be decline in demand for oil due to global growth slowdown on account of rising trade tensions, which may help bring down oil prices. survey, reflecting an optimism on incomes and prices (Chart I.7).6 Optimism in the manufacturing sector for the quarter ahead improved in the September 2018 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey on account of higher order books and selling prices (Chart I.8). The April 2018 MPR had projected an acceleration in real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2018-19 on the back of: (a) the goods and services tax (GST) stabilising; (b) improving credit offtake; (c) likely boost to investment from primary market resource mobilisation; (d) the process of recapitalisation of public sector banks and resolution of distressed assets under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC); (e) buoyant global trade; and (f) the thrust to the rural and infrastructure sectors in the Union Budget 2018- 19. Most of these have materialised, but to varying extent. However, global trade growth, as stated earlier, seems to be losing its synchronised momentum and this may hinder India\u2019s export prospects. The uneven spatial distribution of the south-west monsoon is another factor that has also imparted some uncertainty to the agricultural outlook and inflation. Turning forward-looking surveys, consumer confidence over the year ahead improved marginally in the September 2018 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s 6 The survey is conducted by the Reserve Bank in 13 cities and the September round is based on responses from 5,364 respondents. Surveys by other agencies indicate a mixed picture on future business expectations (Table I.3). Firms in the manufacturing and services sectors polled in the Nikkei\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 surveys (September 2018) were optimistic about their output prospects a year ahead, driven by expected improvement in demand. policy normalisation in the US and other major advanced economies pose downside risks to the baseline growth path. In the September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, professional forecasters expected real GDP growth to decelerate from 8.2 per cent in Q1:2018-19 to 6.9 per cent in Q4 and then recover to 7.4 per cent in Q2:2019- 20 (Chart I.9 and Table I.4). Taking into account the baseline assumptions, monetary policy tightening of 50 bps during June- August 2018, survey indicators and model forecasts, real GDP growth is projected to improve from 6.7 per cent in 2017-18 to 7.4 per cent in 2018-19 \u2013 8.2 per cent in Q1, 7.4 per cent in Q2, 7.3 per cent in Q3 and 7.1 per cent in Q4 \u2013 with risks broadly balanced around this baseline path (Chart I.10). For 2019-20, structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 7.6 per cent, with quarterly growth rates in the range of 7.4-7.9 per cent, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks. Strengthening investment activity and a further pick-up in credit growth impart an upside bias to the baseline growth projections.

Assuming that the Indian basket crude oil price increases by 20 per cent to US$ 96 a barrel, inflation and GDP growth could turn out to be 40 bps above and 30 bps below their respective baselines. Conversely, crude oil prices could soften below the baseline assumption if, for instance, there is a larger than expected shale gas supply and weaker than expected global demand due to growth slowing down on account of protectionist measures. As a result, if the price of the Indian basket of crude falls by 10 per cent to US$ 72 per barrel, inflation could ease by around 20 bps with a boost of 15 bps to growth.

Source:RBIstaffestimates. In the baseline scenario, global growth is expected to be stronger in 2018 and 2019 relative to 2017. While the pace of global growth has been maintained in Q2:2018, it has turned uneven with new risks clouding the outlook. Escalating protectionism and rising geopolitical tensions could weigh on external demand. Tightening of financial conditions on the back of US monetary policy normalisation and expansionary US fiscal policy and uncertainty about the pace of further normalisation could also dampen global demand. If global growth slips by 50 bps, domestic growth and inflation could be around 20 bps and 10 bps below their respective baseline trajectories. However, if inflation remains benign in major advanced economies, a more gradual pace of monetary policy normalisation in these economies could boost global demand and global commodity prices. In this scenario, assuming that global growth surprises by 25 bps on the upside, domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by around 10 bps and 5 bps, respectively (Charts I.11a and I.12a). The baseline projections of inflation and growth presented in the previous two sections are conditional on assumptions relating to key variables such as crude oil prices, external demand, exchange rate movements and fiscal stance (Table I.2) as well as the impact of higher MSPs. There are several uncertainties around the baseline assumptions, however, which could pose risks to baseline projections. The sensitivity of the baseline projections to plausible alternative scenarios is set out below. Sharp swings in global crude prices over the past six months impart uncertainty to the outlook. The baseline scenario assumes crude oil prices (Indian basket) at US$ 80 per barrel in the second half of 2018-19. Upside risks to the baseline assumption can emanate from geo-political developments and supply disruptions. For a net energy importer like India, the dynamics of international crude price movements have significant macroeconomic implications. Box I.1 presents a scenario in which the Indian basket price increases by 10 per cent to US$ 88 per barrel, which is plausible under the current global crude oil price volatility. Under this scenario, inflation could increase by 20 bps and real GDP growth could be lower by around Following the increase in pay and allowances by the central government for its employees based on the recommendations of the 7th central pay commission (CPC), some state governments have revised pay and allowances for their employees. If all state governments Crude oil prices (Indian basket) increased from US$ 47 per barrel in June 2017 to US$ 78 in September 2018, an increase of 67 per cent in a span of 15 months. It is estimated that a US$ 10 increase in the price of international crude oil could reduce output in the OECD area by 20 bps after two years and raise inflation by 20 bps in the first year and by another 10 bps in the second year (OECD, 2011). For large net energy importers like India \u2013 80 per cent of India\u2019s crude oil requirement is met through imports \u2013 recent estimates suggest that real GDP growth could decline from its current trajectory, while inflation could rise significantly above target, rendering the current favourable macroeconomic conditions vulnerable. In addition, it is estimated that for every US$ 1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude, India\u2019s current account deficit could widen by US$ 0.8 billion. equilibrium context. The RBI\u2019s workhorse Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) in its Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS), which draws its analytical underpinnings from new Keynesian foundations7, provides the flexibility to incorporate these various channels. There is the cost push channel that operates through the prices of non-administered fuel products i.e., petrol and diesel, whereby energy costs impact including transportation and firms\u2019 other intermediate services. In addition, crude price increases are transmitted to the domestic economy through reduction in global demand, adverse price movements in respect of imports and exports, and undue volatility in the exchange rate. These diverse channels produce substitutions between energy and non-energy consumption, a reduction in output and an increase in inflation. The monetary policy response to these outcomes can, in turn, set off a chain of macroeconomic adjustments. Increases impact economic activity through a variety of channels. Therefore, it is important to examine their effects in a general The QPM depicts the various channels through which this transmission works (Chart I.1.1). A 10 per cent s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 7 The QPM belongs to the class of new Keynesian open economy models, in which monetary policy matters for output dynamics in the short run. It has equations for the output gap (the IS curve), inflation (the Phillips curve), the short-term interest rate (a policy reaction function), and the exchange rate (an uncovered interest parity condition). The model captures key India-specific sectoral details and dynamics, such as food and fuel price dynamics and their spillovers onto non-food non-fuel components of inflation. s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P the change in crude oil prices but also on their initial level. This is because retail petroleum product prices contain several elements which are largely fixed \u2013 for example, excise duty and refining costs \u2013 while the base price moves in line with the movements in international crude oil prices and the exchange rate. The value added tax component moves in line with prices charged to dealers (inclusive of excise duty). The higher the level of crude oil prices, the smaller is the proportion of fixed elements and larger is the impact of a given increase in crude oil prices on domestic petrol and diesel inflation, and hence on overall inflation and output (Chart I.1.2). For instance, an increase of 10 per cent in crude oil prices from US$ 30 per barrel to US$ 33 per barrel is estimated to increase inflation by 13 bps, while a similar order of increase from US$ 100 a barrel to US$ 110 a barrel could pull up inflation by around 22 bps. increase in international crude prices imparts a shock to petroleum product prices. Headline inflation goes up instantaneously by 13 bps, which takes up to a year to wear off. Furthermore, an increase in petroleum prices imparts cost push effects, which contribute about 15 bps to the increase in headline inflation. People react by spending less on non-oil items of consumption, reducing demand. To the extent that firms are not able to pass through the increase in oil prices to product prices, it reduces their profit margins, cash flows and investment. As a result, aggregate demand declines, leading to a negative contribution to inflation in the range of 5-10 bps. The crude oil price increase can also lead to a deterioration in the trade deficit, which can put downward pressure on the rupee, translating into an additional 10 bps increase in inflation. Consequently, monetary policy tightening is required to bring inflation back to target. The monetary policy reaction widens the output gap, compressing demand and thereby inflation. At its peak, the impact of the 10 per cent increase in crude oil price shock is expected to reduce growth by 15 bps and push up headline inflation by around 20 bps. References: Benes, Jaromir, et al.

Additional indirect effects could also arise from higher demand and inflation expectations. As noted by the MPC in its recent resolutions, the direct statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through for policy purposes, while being watchful for any second-round effects. The INR depreciated vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar during April-September, reflecting both domestic and global developments. Looking ahead, a faster pace of monetary policy normalisation by the US Fed than currently factored in by financial markets, rising trade protectionism, threat of currency wars, and higher international crude oil prices are some of the factors that could exert downward pressure on the Indian rupee. Assuming a depreciation of the Indian rupee by around 5 per cent relative to the baseline, inflation could increase by around 20 bps, while the likely boost to net exports could push up growth by around 15 bps. On the other hand, India could also attract large inflows with its reasonably sound domestic fundamentals relative to its peers and the various initiatives taken by the government to boost investment. An appreciation of the Indian rupee by 5 per cent in this scenario could soften inflation by around 20 bps and GDP growth by around 15 bps in 2018-19 (Charts I.11b and I.12b). volatility, crowding out of private investment and higher inflation. Quantitative estimates of these risks will, however, be reliant on incoming data right up to the April 2019 MPR. The large increase in MSPs for kharif crops announced by the government in July 2018 can have a direct impact on food inflation and second round effects on headline inflation through relative price adjustments, higher demand on the back of higher rural incomes and increase in inflation expectations. The baseline projections incorporate the likely effect of the increase in MSPs on inflation, assuming normal procurement by the government in line with past trends (Box II.1). However, if procurement operations turn out to be larger than assumed, headline inflation could increase by around 20 bps above the baseline. To sum up, real GDP growth is expected to accelerate in 2018-19 vis-\u00e0-vis 2017-18, with the pace of growth easing in H2 relative to H1. Stabilisation of the goods and services tax, progress on resolution of distressed assets under the insolvency and bankruptcy code and initiatives towards strengthening of bank balance sheets are supporting economic and investment activity. However, the uncertain global environment poses an important downside risk to the domestic growth outlook. The baseline projections assume a fiscal stance as announced in the Union and State budgets for 2018- 19. Higher MSPs combined with stepped-up food procurement operations and unbudgeted farm loan waivers by states pose upside risks to the fiscal outlook. Should there be fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it could result in greater market Inflation is expected to pick up from its current levels as the MSPs for kharif crops feed into domestic food inflation and favourable base effects dissipate. Volatile crude oil prices and the volatility in international financial markets pose the primary upside risks to the Inflation has eased in Q2:2018-19 on an unusual ebbing in the momentum of food prices, after rising strongly in Q1 on the back of surging prices of non-food items (including the impact of 7th CPC\u2019s HRA increase) across categories. Input costs rose sharply in Q1 and remained firm in Q2, largely due to increase in fuel prices. Wage pressures remained contained in both rural and organised sectors. Over the first half of 2018-19, the course of consumer price index (CPI) inflation has been shaped by diverse pulls. Within major groups, while food inflation remained soft in Q1:2018-19, and declined sharply in July and August 2018, fuel and light inflation rose noticeably, tracking international prices. Inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel also firmed up in Q1:2018-19 and remained elevated through July- August, notwithstanding some softening. The impact of the increase in house rent allowances (HRA) for central government employees on headline inflation has started to ebb from July.1 Adjusting for the HRA impact, headline inflation in August was estimated at 3.4 per cent as against the print of 3.7 per cent and inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel was estimated at 5.4 per cent against the reading of 6.0 percent (Chart II.1).2 5.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19 and then moderate to 4.7 per cent in Q2. Excluding the estimated impact of HRA, CPI inflation was projected at 4.7 per cent in Q1 and then moderate to 4.4 per cent in Q2. Actual inflation outcomes have tracked these projections directionally; in terms of magnitude, however, inflation undershot projections by a considerable margin \u2013 28 basis points (bps) in Q1 and 74 bps in Q2 up to August (Chart II.2) \u2013 entirely on account of a surprising persistence in the softening of prices of fruits, particularly in Q2, and lower than usual hardening in prices of vegetables in the summer months. Food inflation fell from 3.7 per cent in Q4:2017-18 to 3.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19. This is a significant development because it occurred on a base which reflected the after effects of demonetisation in depressing prices of fruits and vegetables in Q1 a year ago. Subsequently, food inflation plunged further to 1.3 per cent in July-August as strong favourable base effects coincided with inexplicable weak momentum The MPR of April 2018 had projected CPI inflation to increase from 4.6 per cent observed in Q4:2017-18 to 6 1 - r p A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A CPI Headline CPI Excluding food and fuel adjusted for HRA* HRA: House Rent Allowance. *: Estimated impact based on reconstructed housing index with trend in housing Sources: Central Statistics Office (CSO) and RBI ; based on the year preceding 7 CPC HRA implemention. 1 The Government of India implemented the recommendation of the Seventh Central Pay Commission (CPC) of inter alia a 105.6 per cent increase in HRA with effect from July 2017. 2 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year changes in all-India CPI-Combined (Rural + Urban). s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e p n s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P i p a G Gap (actual \u2013 projected, right scale) 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A of food prices. In fact, ebbing food inflation more than offset the impact of higher than projected crude oil prices \u2013 US$ 73.5 per barrel, on an average, during H1:2018-19 vis-\u00e0-vis the baseline assumption of US$ 68 per barrel in April 2018. As stated earlier, headline inflation dynamics in H1:2018-19 have reflected divergent movements among constituents which are revealed when momentum and base effects are disentangled. In the case of food items, there has been an unusually low momentum in prices of vegetables and an unexpected decline in prices of fruits in H1. In Q2, base effects turned favourable and along with unseasonally low momentum pulled down food inflation to just 1.3 per cent (up to August 2018) well below its quarterly trend level of six years (7.1 per cent). In the case of items excluding food and fuel, momentum in prices remained strong during April-May in Q1. Thereafter, in Q2 so far, momentum effects have been offset by favourable base effects. As a result, the monotonic hardening of headline inflation from 4.3 per cent in March 2018 to 4.9 per cent by June reversed and inflation fell to 3.7 per cent in August (Chart II.3). outcomes in 2017, a period that also saw soft inflation readings coming from moderation in food inflation in the post-demonetisation period. Median inflation rates were in the range of 4.3-4.8 per cent in both the years and inflation exhibited considerable negative skew on account of deflation in pulses and sugar prices (Chart II.4). Diffusion indices of price changes in CPI items suggest that on a seasonally adjusted basis, a broadening swathe of goods and almost all services have experienced price increases since July, implying y t i s n e D On an average, the distribution of inflation across CPI groups in 2018 so far had striking similarities with the essentially from food group, have defined the overall change in headline inflation trajectory since Q3:2016- 17. In H1:2018-19, several factors impacted inflation \u2013 a favourable food supply shock; an adverse oil price shock; and soft rural wage growth in spite of the quickening of agricultural activity and indications of firming up of rural demand (Chart II.6a).4 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A The pick-up in services inflation was led by elevated house rentals on the back of increase in HRA for central government employees. Inflation in other items of services \u2013 education, transport and medical \u2013 also firmed up. From July, however, goods inflation \u2013 especially in respect of perishables \u2013 pulled down overall inflation, helped by subdued month-on-month changes and favourable base effects (Chart II.6b). that soft headline inflation reading is occurring alongside generalised price increases across goods and services (Chart II.5).3 A historical decomposition of inflation shows that large and sequential supply side shocks, emanating In terms of weighted contributions, the food group contributed 25.2 per cent to overall inflation during April-August 2018 in contrast to 8.9 per cent a year ago. The average contribution of food inflation to overall inflation in the last five years has been 47 per cent. Within food, inflation in cereals, which has a weight of 9.7 per cent in the CPI and 21.1 per cent in the food and beverages group, remained benign at sub- 3 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. A reading above 50 for the diffusion index signals a broad expansion or the extent of generalisation of price increases and a reading below 50 signals a broad-based deflation. 4 Historical decompositions are used to estimate the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period, based on a Vector Auto Regression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt) \u2013 the annual growth rate in crude oil prices; inflation; the output gap; the annual growth rate in rural wages and the policy repo rate. The VAR can be written in reduced form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et ; where et represents a vector of shocks [oil price shock; supply shock (inflation shock); output gap shock; wage shock; and policy shock]. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks. s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e p n n o i t u b i r t n o C r e p ( n o i t a l f n I 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A Oils and fats Pulses and products Animal proteins* line represents the median weight among food group (7 per cent) and 3 per cent level during H1:2018-19, with production boosted by two consecutive years of record harvests, and stocks being well above buffer norms. The food inflation trajectory was largely shaped by vegetables, fruits, pulses and sugar during H1:2018-19, with its unexpected slump defying the usual seasonal uptick, especially in prices of vegetables during July-August (Charts II.7 and II.8). Vegetables account for 6 per cent of the CPI and 13.2 per cent of the food and beverages group. A delayed winter easing of price pressures in vegetables commenced from December 2017 and extended well up to April 2018, as mandi arrivals, specifically of onions and tomatoes, surged muting the usual summer upturn (Chart II.9a). Onion inflation declined from a high of 159 per cent in December 2017 to 23 per cent in May 2018, pulled down by bumper mandi arrivals, imports, and implementation of a minimum export price (MEP) that deterred exports, together creating persistent surplus supply conditions. Onion prices, however, picked up in July with the country-wide transporters\u2019 strike, which affected the supplies of essential food items. After remaining low during April-May, prices of tomatoes recorded an upsurge during June-July due to widespread farmers\u2019 agitations. By contrast, price pressures have been more pronounced in respect of s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e p n n o i t u b i r t n o C 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A 6 1 - r p A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A 6 1 - r p A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A Vegetables index \u2013trend component 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A potatoes since March 2018 due to lower availability of stocks from cold storages, transport disruptions and protests organised by potato farmers against not receiving remunerative prices for their crops. Prices of vegetables, however, witnessed some easing in August 2018 led by a contraction in prices of tomatoes and moderation in onion price pressures as arrivals surged, which played a key role in moderating food inflation during the month. An analysis of prices of vegetables based on sectoral CPI indices suggests that there is no statistically significant difference in month-on-month changes in prices of vegetables between rural and urban areas.5 A decomposition of the CPI-vegetables into its trend and cyclical components reveals a rising trend since H1:2017-18, indicating that the recent softening in vegetable prices may not be structural in nature (Chart II.9b). Fruits prices also declined during June-August, contrary to the usual seasonal pattern. Fruits have a weight of 2.9 per cent in the CPI and 6.3 per cent within the food and beverages sub-component. Healthy domestic production of major fruits like mangoes and bananas, together with imports of some fruits (particularly apples and citrus fruits) pulled down fruits prices in contrast to the usual pattern in June and July every year when they rise (Chart II.10). Deflation in the prices of pulses persisted on the back of over-supply, though the pace of deflation moderated during H1. Pulses account for 2.4 per cent of the CPI and 5.2 per cent of the food and beverages sub-component. Mandi level prices of some pulses such as arhar and urad remained below their minimum support prices (MSPs) in major producing states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. In response, several measures that had been undertaken by the government in the previous year were extended into 2018-19 such as (i) removal of the export ban on all pulses; and (ii) imposition of import duty of 60 per cent on gram and 30 per cent on masoor to provide some relief to farmers. Nonetheless, pulses prices continued to rule well below their historical trend during H1:2018-19 (Chart II.11). Prices of sugar and confectionery also remained in deflation zone from February 2018 on account of surplus production during the sugarcane season of 2017-18 (Charts II.7 and II.8). Domestic sugar prices have closely tracked global price movements which have also been in deflation due to excess global supply. In view of the sharp decline in sugar prices, the government raised the import duty on sugar to 100 per cent, besides re-imposing stockholding limits on sugar sales and fixing the ex-mill sugar prices to `29 per kg in June 2018. Moreover, the customs duty Chart II.10: Seasonality in CPI-Fruits (M o m over March) l i r p A y a M t s u g u A r e b m e c e D y r a u n a J y r a u r b e F h c r a M 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - g u A 3 1 - g u A 4 1 - g u A 5 1 - g u A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - g u A 5 Based on a t-test framework. The robustness of the results was tested using both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted data. on export of sugar was withdrawn to encourage the sugar industry. These measures, along with supply disruptions in July following the transporters\u2019 strike, drove up sugar prices during June-August, though y-o-y inflation continued to be in the negative zone. In the case of protein-rich items such as eggs, price pressures were visible during June-July 2018, reflecting the combined impact of the usual lower egg production during summer months and higher consumption during early monsoon months in several parts of the country. Furthermore, the country-wide truckers\u2019 strike in July also affected the supply of eggs in several states, adding to upside pressures on prices. However, prices of eggs softened in August. Among other protein-rich items, meat and fish prices experienced the usual upside pressures during May-June, followed by easing during July-August. In the case of milk and products, price pressures were subdued due to robust growth in milk production. After an increase in import duties on all major varieties of oils in November 2017, duties were hiked further during March and June 2018 in order to curb cheap imports. Inflation in spices started rising beginning April 2018 after remaining in deflation for 10 successive months since June 2017. While pressures on black pepper prices have remained muted so far, prices of other spices like dry chillies, turmeric, jeera, dhania and tamarind have firmed up, thereby driving up overall inflation in this group (Charts II.7 and II.8). On July 4, 2018 the central government announced minimum support prices (MSPs) for all kharif crops of a minimum of 150 per cent of the cost of production. Increases in MSPs generally get transmitted to headline inflation through direct and second round effects and, it is in the context of the upside risks to the near-term inflation outlook that the size and span of the impact of the MSP need to be carefully evaluated (Box II.1). Among other food components, edible oil inflation recorded a pick-up in August 2018 after remaining in the range of one to three per cent since May 2017. Fuel and light inflation increased sequentially every month from a trough of 5.2 per cent in April 2018 to Fulfilling the announcement made in the Union Budget 2018-19, MSPs for 14 crops for the 2018-19 kharif season were raised to at least 1.5 times of production (A2+FL) costs.6 This implies a nominal MSP increase in the range of 3.7 to 52.5 per cent for different crops over their levels a year ago, an area weighted increase of 17.3 per cent, a production weighted increase of 14.0 per cent, and a CPI weighted increase of 13.3 per cent (excluding cotton, as it does not appear directly in the CPI basket). In a historical perspective, the current increase in MSPs is significantly higher than the average of the last five years, but well below the upward revisions effected in 2008-09 and 2012-13 (Chart II.1.1). Empirically, it is observed that procurement is the channel through which higher MSPs pass through into inflation (RBI, 2018). For kharif crops, procurement has been the highest in respect of paddy at 32.4 per cent of production (average of last seven years), whereas it is negligible or absent in the case of other crops; an outlier was arhar for which procurement increased from insignificant levels to 23.7 per cent of production in 2016-17 as a part of the government\u2019s food management strategy (Chart II.1.2). 6 A2 covers actual paid out costs, while FL is the imputed value of family labour used in production. n o i t c u d o r p l a t o t I n d i r e c t Estimates of the impact of the July 2018 MSP announcements on CPI inflation that are available in the public domain range from 20 bps to 110 bps. For operational purposes, however, precision in these estimates is the key since it conditions the monetary policy response to the likely deviations of inflation from its target. Illustratively, a straight-line approach of imputing the full increase in MSPs on to headline CPI inflation by using CPI weights for the crops in consideration, but without factoring in the scale of procurement operations, may overestimate the MSP impact. The total impact of MSPs on inflation comprises a first round (direct) effect and subsequent second (indirect) round effects. The first round effect \u2013 the quantum by which individual commodities respond to MSP shock \u2013 is estimated econometrically. The second-round effects are estimated using a two-stage process: (1) A static approach that mimics time-invariant economy-wide effects, is first employed to estimate the commodity level producer price effect through a series of iterations using input-output (IO) tables for 2012-13 and mapping those effects to the wholesale price index (WPI) using WPI weights; (2) The pass-through of the wholesale price increases to CPI food inflation components is then worked out by using elasticities derived from an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model. The second-round effects are also examined using RBI\u2019s quarterly projection model, which is a new Keynesian open economy gap model. It attempts to capture several inter-twined effects dynamically. A hike in MSP could trigger relative price adjustments between MSP and non-MSP food items. Higher MSPs could also lead to a rise in rural incomes which would boost food demand. Furthermore, higher labour demand could lead to overall wage increases in the rural sector as labourers migrate from sowing/cropping of non-MSP to MSP crops. This increase in prices of food items, coupled with rising rural wages and incomes, could affect prices of non-food goods and services via second round effects (Ghate et al ., 2018). The increase in the cotton MSP could directly affect inflation through retail clothing (Chart II.1.3). A first approximation of the inflationary impact of MSP increase from these methodologies yields 29-35 bps increase in headline CPI inflation. These estimates are highly tentative in the absence of robust information on the actual size and scale of procurement operations or more broadly on the combined effectiveness of procurement, price support/deficiency schemes and private sector participation as envisaged under the Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan (PM AASHA) programme. Accordingly, these initial estimates need to be read with appropriate caveats and revisited once further details are released on actual MSP implementation. References: Benes, M. J., K. Clinton, A. T.

Note: September 2013 represents the peak level for petrol prices in India. the housing group still contributed a fifth of overall increase in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. The second largest contributor in this category was the transport and communication sub-group, largely reflecting increases in petrol and diesel pump prices and second-round effects on transport fares. Petrol (and diesel) pump prices during H1:2018-19 increased sharply by about `10 per litre, as international prices surged (Chart II.15). As a result, the contribution of petrol and diesel (with a weight of 2.3 per cent) to CPI excluding food and fuel inflation rose from 1.7 per cent in March 2018 to 8.6 per cent in August. Accentuating the impact of petrol and diesel on inflation in the recent period has been the asymmetric pass-through of international crude oil prices to domestic prices since 2014 (Chart II.15). Excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel, CPI inflation increased from 5.2 per cent in February to peak at 6.2 per cent in June, before moderating to 5.8 per cent in July and to 5.7 per cent in August. Excluding the four volatile items \u2013 petrol, diesel, gold and silver \u2013 as well as housing, CPI inflation increased by 120 bps from February to 5.5 per cent in June, before moderating to 5.0\u20135.1 per cent in July\u2013August (Chart II.13). The edging down of inflation in July and August was due to lower inflation prints in pan, tobacco and intoxicants, clothing and footwear, and miscellaneous groups. Inflation in respect of both goods and services in the CPI excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel edged up during Q1:2018-19 (Chart II.16). For goods, inflation picked up across commodity groups, particularly medicines, clothing and footwear, bedding, utensils s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 6 1 - r p A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A 6 1 - r p A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A Clothing and footwear Services inflation (excluding HRA mpact) (per cent) Housing (excluding HRA mpact) and washing powder. However, during July-August 2018, goods inflation moderated sharply by 80 bps, driven primarily by a fall in inflation in pan, tobacco and intoxicants group and personal care and effects sub-group (Chart II.16a). Services inflation rose in H1:2018-19 to reach a peak of 6.9 per cent in June, driven up largely by the HRA increases and an increase in tuition fees and prices of transportation services, as alluded to earlier. As the HRA effects started to wane, services inflation moderated to 6.5 per cent in August (Chart II.16b). Excluding the HRA impact, services inflation rose from 5.0 per cent in March and remained steady at 5.5 per cent during June-August. Communication services inflation, however, remained muted due to subdued prices in respect of cellular services. \u2013 created sizeable upside impulses pushing CPI-IW inflation significantly above headline CPI inflation in July.7 Accordingly, as the impact of the HRA increase intensified, CPI-IW inflation shot up to 5.6 per cent in August from 3.9 per cent in June. In contrast, wholesale price index (WPI) inflation firmed up significantly in Q1, driven up by international prices of crude petroleum and high speed diesel. Inflation in respect of electricity, naphtha, furnace oil, manufacture of plastic products, manufactured vegetable and animal oils and fats also fuelled WPI inflation. GDP and GVA deflators also ticked up in Q1 in line with WPI inflation (Chart II.17a) which moderated somewhat in July and August with the collapse in food inflation. Measures of inflation other than the CPI have shown mixed movements since the April MPR. After the HRA-linked spike in January 2018, inflation in terms of CPI for industrial workers (CPI-IW) declined in line with inflation in CPI for agricultural labourers (AL) and rural labourers (RL), reflecting inter alia soft food inflation readings. CPI-IW reflects changes in its housing index once in six months \u2013 in January and July every year. The revision in CPI-IW housing index \u2013 from 3.0 per cent in December 2017 to 10.2 per cent in January 2018 and further to 26.1 per cent in July Volatile prices of items such as transport fuel, vegetables, pulses and precious metals impart high dispersion, asymmetry and non-normality to the distribution of inflation. High positive as well as negative skew and chronic fat tails in the inflation distribution could be removed by trimming the outliers. Trimmed means of CPI, including its weighted median, rose sharply in Q1:2018-19 before softening in July and August (Chart II.17b). Measures of inflation have largely tracked underlying cost conditions. In the case of industrial and farm costs s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - g u A 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A 6 1 - r p A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A 10% trimmed Median 7 The weight of housing in the CPI-IW is higher at 15.3 per cent than its weight of 10.1 per cent in the CPI. respect of pesticides and other agrochemical products was driven by uptick in inflation in insecticide and pesticide even as deflation in fungicide prices continued. Prices of fodder remained in deflation due to increased production on the back of good monsoons during the last two years. Inflation in respect of electricity, which has a high weight in both industrial and farm inputs, rose significantly during May-August, reflecting mainly the price surge on account of supply disruptions in the summer following severe dust storms in northern India and adverse base effect in August. Additionally, the distribution companies (DISCOMS) raised their tariffs, following the diversion of coal supplies by the government away from captive power producers to thermal power plants with low stocks. in the WPI and remained elevated in Q2 so far (Chart II.18). The rise in global crude oil prices impacted domestic prices of inputs such as high speed diesel, aviation turbine fuel, naptha, bitumen, furnace oil and petroleum coke, pushing up domestic farm and non- farm costs. Input cost pressures weakened slightly in July 2018, reflecting soft metal prices and transient easing of global crude oil prices. Growth in rural wages, both for agricultural and non- agricultural labourers, has remained subdued since August 2017, reflecting the lagged impact of low inflation in the previous few months (Chart II.19). Pressure from staff costs in the organised sector has broadly been contained. The uptick in staff costs growth in the manufacturing sector in Q4 was short- lived and it slid back in Q1:2018-19. The annual growth in per employee cost for the manufacturing sector Among other industrial raw materials, domestic coal inflation slowed down significantly as compared with the previous year\u2019s level. Inflation in respect of paper and paper products has also remained moderate so far, reflecting inter alia cheap imports of paper under free trade agreements with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South Korea. Inflation in prices of fibres (specifically cotton, jute and mesta) after remaining in negative territory during February to May 2018, picked up subsequently due to elevated international prices and lower production estimates for 2018-19 season. Among farm sector inputs, inflation in respect of agricultural input prices such as fertilisers increased gradually in line with international prices. Despite rising demand, prices of tractors remained stable on the back of increased competition as tractor firms aspired to expand their market shares.

For the services sector, the sequential deceleration since Q4:2015-16 in staff cost growth was interrupted by an uptick in Q1:2018-19 when it rose by 9.8 per cent (Chart II.20a). Unit labour costs for companies in the manufacturing sector have been volatile and remained muted in Q1:2018-19.8 Unit labour costs in the services sector edged down in Q1, with the growth in value of production outpacing the growth of staff cost (Chart II.20b). Pressure from rising commodity prices was also reflected in an increase in input costs of manufacturing firms covered in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey. These firms reported a rise in the cost of raw materials in Q2:2018-19 and expected it to increase further in Q3. However, they are not expecting to pass the entire cost burden to selling prices, reflecting still subdued pricing power. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) as well as the services PMI point to an increase in the cost of raw materials in Q1 and Q2 so far. Firms covered in these indices also reported an increase in their selling prices, indicating that some pass-through of higher costs to clients may already be occurring. Going forward, inflation outcomes will be influenced by several factors. The government has announced measures aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce. The magnitude of the impact of these measures on CPI inflation will be contingent upon the manner and effectiveness with which these measures are implemented. Risks to inflation could emanate from rising geopolitical and trade tensions, with attendant implications for global commodity prices and financial markets. The impact of the 7th CPC HRA award on headline inflation has started waning and the effect of increases in HRA by states is not yet visible. As and when HRA awards by states start showing up in the CPI, it will impact headline inflation. As in the case of the centre\u2019s HRA, second round effects will warrant vigilance. The near-term inflation expectations of households and those of businesses polled in the forward-looking surveys of the Reserve Bank of India have firmed up over successive rounds, with the potential to feed into wages and input costs. While low food inflation prints and the positive outlook on food \u2013 on account of supply management measures by government and a normal monsoon \u2013 provide comfort, it is necessary to be watchful as several upside risks to inflation persist, notably from surging oil prices and volatile financial markets. 8 Unit labour cost is defined here as the ratio of staff cost to value of production. Aggregate demand has been underpinned by the strengthening of private consumption and investment demand. The drag from external demand has reduced with a robust pick-up in non-oil merchandise exports. Aggregate supply conditions improved with a sharp acceleration in manufacturing and the resilience in agriculture and allied activities. Raising real investment activity on a durable basis holds the key to sustaining the growth momentum, going forward. Since the start of 2018, i.e., from the January-March 2018 quarter, economic activity in India appears to be charting a step-up in its trajectory. Quarterly estimates of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for Q1:2018- 19 (April-June) confirm that gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 8 per cent in the January-June 2018 period, up from 6.6 per cent in the period July- December 2017. High frequency and survey-based indicators suggest that aggregate demand is fast catching up with aggregate supply. Sales growth, pick- up in capacity utilisation and the acceleration in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) space attest that the output gap has virtually closed. Measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in real GDP at market prices, aggregate demand strengthened to 7.7 per cent in Q4:2017-18 and surged to a nine- quarter high of 8.2 per cent in Q1:2018-19 (Table III.1). This extended its sequential acceleration to four successive quarters, beginning in Q2:2017-18. Momentum, measured by q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised rate (SAAR), however, moderated in Q1:2018-19 (Chart III.1a). Meanwhile, another engine of aggregate demand has started to pick-up with the bounce-back in merchandise exports. On the supply side, the rapid catch-up in sowing activity, backed by ample reservoir storage, brightens the outlook for agriculture and allied activities on top of the record production in 2017-18. Industrial activity has strengthened and become more broad-based, buoyed by manufacturing. The services sector remains resilient, supported by strong growth in construction activity as well as Among its components, consumption expanded on the back of growth in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE), which reached a six-quarter high of 8.6 per cent in Q1:2018-19. Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) decelerated to 7.6 per cent, albeit from a high of 16.9 per cent in Q4:2017-18. Investment demand embodied in the growth of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) decelerated sequentially in Q1:2018-19; however, it remained reasonably strong at 10 per cent, given the Private final consumption expenditure Government final consumption expenditure Gross fixed capital formation Exports Imports GDP at market prices PE: Provisional Estimates. *: Component-wise contributions do not add up to GDP growth in the table because changes in stocks, valuables and discrepancies are not included.

Despite a hostile and unpredictable trading environment, growth of international exports of goods and services jumped to a 16-quarter high of 12.7 per cent in Q1:2018-19, mitigating the negative contribution of net exports to aggregate demand caused by the unrelenting surge in imports (Chart III.1b). The April 2018 MPR had projected real GDP growth of 7.3 per cent for Q1:2018-19, with risks evenly balanced around the baseline path (Chart III.2). The actual outcome for the quarter overshot the projection by 90 basis points, reflecting larger than expected gains in most of the constituents of aggregate demand. First, private consumption demand surprised on the upside in Q1:2018-19 and touched a six-quarter peak. The April 2018 projection had assumed that lingering effects of the goods and services tax (GST) implementation would have an adverse impact on consumption demand \u2013 especially in urban areas \u2013 through loss of output and employment in unorganised activities. Furthermore, a sharp acceleration in allied activities in the agricultural sector posted a growth of 8.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19, which was significantly above trend. This is likely to have boosted rural consumption. Second, GFCF growth overshot the projection on account of stronger than expected capital goods production and the robust recovery in the construction sector. PFCE remained the mainstay of aggregate demand running ahead in Q1:2018-19 on the strength of rising rural and urban demand and undeterred by the surge in domestic prices of petroleum products. After rising since the beginning of 2017-18, wage (staff cost per employee) growth in the organised manufacturing and services sectors has remained range bound (see Chart II.20, Chapter II). However, in the information technology (IT) sector, growth High frequency indicators of urban consumption present a mixed picture. While domestic air passenger traffic and production of consumer durables expanded during Q1 and Q2:2018-19 so far, sales of passenger cars contracted during July-August, after peaking in June, possibly as a response to the sharp rise in fuel prices (Chart III.4). Household credit demand in the form of personal loans and leasing of vehicles by commercial banks maintained a robust tempo (Chart III.5). Going forward, urban consumption is expected to strengthen further on the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) awards by states and the recent reduction in GST rates. 6 1 - r p A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A Jute manufacture including floor coverings in staff cost was robust in Q1:2018-19, which could have added to the purchasing power. In contrast, anecdotal evidence suggests that following a decline in exports and moderation in domestic production, growth in wage incomes could have moderated in some of the labour-intensive segments such as readymade garments, and jute manufactures, which, in turn, might have impacted consumption demand (Chart III.3). 8 1 - g u A High frequency indicators of rural demand seem to be indicating a slight loss of momentum in Q2:2018- 19 (Chart III.6). Sales of motorcycles and tractors, which grew robustly during Q1:2018-19, decelerated in Q2 (July-August). Nevertheless, construction activity in rural areas has been buoyant since Q2:2017-18, supported by the government\u2019s thrust on rural housing and roads. Strong topline growth of FMCG companies, a sizeable part of which emanates from rural areas, also corroborates the improving dynamics of rural consumption.

Capacity utilisation (seasonally adjusted) gained momentum and improved to 74.9 per cent in Q1:2018- 19, higher than the level recorded in the first quarter of the past year (Chart III.9). The number of stalled projects, though reported some improvement in both and Q1:2018-19, there was a slight deterioration in Growth in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), which had accelerated to a seven-quarter high of 14.4 per cent in Q4:2017-18, retained double-digit growth in Q1:2018-19 with some moderation in pace relative to the previous quarter. The share of GFCF in aggregate demand in Q1:2018-19 at 31.6 per cent was higher than 31.0 per cent a year ago, indicating improving investment demand. Robust investment activity was also reflected in several high frequency indicators such as steel consumption, cement production, and import of capital goods (Chart III.8). Strong growth in housing loans disbursed by scheduled commercial banks finance (SCBs) and especially housing companies also suggests rising investment in the construction sector. 6 1 - r p A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A 1 The kernel density plot of annual PFCE growth for the period 1996-97 to 2017-18 shows skewed concentration of PFCE growth to the right of the x-axis (i.e., higher than average growth) in normal monsoon years. Housing loans by SCBs (RHS) Since 2011-12, capital formation has decelerated due to the slowdown in investment in the private sector, weighed down, inter alia, by overhang of corporate debt (Chart III.11). Empirical analysis suggests that higher leverage constrains firms\u2019 ability to invest, resulting in slowdown in fresh investment (Box III.1). Since H2:2017-18, however, the corporate sector has been deleveraging, especially in the manufacturing sector, which is reflected in an improvement in their interest coverage ratios (ICRs) (Chart III.12). Recent data on investment activity and several lead/coincident indicators of investment, viz., sales growth, capacity utilisation, inventory drawdown, and gradually returning pricing power suggest that the investment cycle has turned.2 P D G f o t n e c Note: Gross capital formation here excludes valuables and errors & omissions. Sources: Government of India and RBI staff estimates. Empirical evidence on firm-level capital investment points to sales growth, leverage, growth of debt and repaying capacity of firms being its key determinants (Krznar and Matheson, 2018; Li, Magud and Valencia, 2015; Magud and Sosa, 2015). Leverage, which affects investment behaviour in multiple ways, constrains a firm\u2019s capacity to mobilise external resources for financing new and risky projects. In a scenario of high leverage, major gains from investment accrue to debt-holders, thereby discouraging promoters from undertaking further investment. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, leverage of Indian non- financial firms, measured as the ratio of debt to equity, rose across sectors, eroding debt servicing capacity and undermining investment decisions. In order to formally examine the impact of leverage on investment activity, firm-level data of both listed and non-listed non-financial companies for the period of 2004 to 2017 drawn from the CMIE\u2019s Prowess database were modelled in a dynamic Arellano-Bond panel regression framework that addresses the problem of potential endogeneity of regressors: where CapExit is firm i\u2019s investment to fixed assets (III.e.1) ratio at time t, LEVit is the firm i\u2019s debt to equity ratio at time t indicating leverage, ICRit is the firm i\u2019s interest Salesit is the growth in sales coverage ratio at time t, OpProfitit is the growth in operating of firm i at time t, profit of firm i at time t, and Debtit is the growth in outstanding debt of firm i at time t, PBRit is the market price to book value ratio of firm i at time t, and \u03b5it is the error term. The results confirm the dominant negative influence of leverage in determining fixed investment while sales growth, operating profit and market price to book value positively affect investment (Table III.1.1). One percentage point increase in leverage was found to reduce fixed investment by 40 basis points. The specification was also tested at sectoral level, viz., manufacturing, construction and metals. The sectoral results also corroborate the aggregate findings. The growth of outstanding debt is found to have a positive impact on capital expenditure as firms finance long- term investment by incurring new debt. Sales growth, Note: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Source: RBI staff estimates. an indicator of current and future demand, also leads to further investment, supporting that the investment accelerator is at work. To conclude, high leverage among non-financial firms leads to a slowdown of investment in the economy. Recent concerted efforts to strengthen balance sheets of both firms and banks are expected to lead to pick-up in capital formation in the medium to long term. Krznar, I., and T.

The fiscal position of the central government showed an improvement in terms of key deficit indicators, as per cent of budget estimates (BE), during April-August 2018-19 as growth in revenue receipts exceeded that of expenditure (Table III.2). Tax revenues grew by 7.5 per cent, supported by higher income tax collections (Charts III.13a and b). Notwithstanding month-over-month fluctuations, the overall indirect tax base has expanded. Ongoing simplification of procedures and rationalisation of GST rates have encouraged voluntary compliance, especially in the business-to-business segment and small enterprises. Many registrants under the GST network (GSTN) were those who fell below the GST threshold but nevertheless chose to be a part of the GST. Similarly, more than 50 percent of those who could have chosen to opt for the simpler composition scheme chose to register under the regular GST scheme.3 States\u2019 own tax revenues, comprising mainly their collection under the state goods and services tax (SGST), have stabilised in recent months, though there is some uncertainty relating to the sharing of revenues from the integrated goods and services tax BE: Budget Estimates.

(IGST) between the centre and states and the transfer under GST compensation cess.4 Furthermore, non- tax revenues have shown a marked improvement for centre. On the expenditure front, accounts for April-August 2018-19 reveal a marked moderation in revenue expenditure mainly due to lower subsidy outgo. The quality of expenditure improved, with growth in capital expenditure \u2013 at 20.6 per cent \u2013 outpacing n o i l l i b n o i l l i b Union excise duties GST (including compensation cess) 3 Economic Survey, 2017-18. 4 Going forward, the uncertainty associated with apportionment of IGST/GST compensation cess might dissipate given the latest amendments made in the respective Acts dated August 30, 2018. r e p s a e r u t i d n e p x e e r u t i d n e p x e revenue expenditure. As regards states, the share of revenue expenditure in their total expenditure was estimated slightly lower at 83 per cent in their BE for 2018-19, though still higher than in 2015-16 and 2016-17 (Table III.3). Debt outstanding as per cent to GSDP There is a positive relationship between indebtedness of states (debt/GSDP) and their respective shares of revenue expenditure in total expenditure. This relationship is stronger in the case of non-special category states than in special category states5 (Chart III.14). States with high interest burden (higher interest payment as per cent of revenue expenditure) find it more difficult to control their revenue expenditure, thereby putting a strain on the quality of expenditure. During 2017-18, the combined fiscal position of the centre and states deteriorated vis-\u00e0-vis BE due to elevated revenue expenditure and subdued growth in revenue collection resulting from the teething problems with the GST implementation. Consequently, the fiscal deficit of centre and states deviated significantly from BE. The combined gross fiscal deficit (GFD) is budgeted to decline to 5.9 per cent of GDP in 2018-19 from 6.6 per cent in the 5 The special category status to some states was given by the National Development Council (NDC) in 1969 by granting certain disadvantaged states with preferential treatment in the form of central assistance and tax concessions, though there is no such provision in the Indian Constitution for such categorization. Over time, various criteria have been devised for granting special category to a state, which, inter alia, include: economic and infrastructural backwardness; non-viable nature of state finances; hilly and difficult geographical terrain; low population density or sizeable share of tribal population; and strategic location along borders with neighbouring countries. At present, eleven states, viz., Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura and Uttarakhand have been bestowed with this status. revised estimates (RE) for 2017-18. Outstanding liabilities of the general government (centre and states) are budgeted to decline to 68.3 per cent of GDP by end-March 2019 from 68.9 per cent a year ago (RE).6 Concerted efforts towards consolidation will, however, be needed for achieving the revised Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) targets, i.e., the central government debt to GDP ratio of 40 per cent and the general government debt to GDP ratio of 60 per cent by 2024-25. The Reserve Bank managed the centre\u2019s market borrowing programme during 2018-19 so far as per the planned issuance schedule, despite reduced demand for government securities from foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). Against the budgeted market borrowing for 2018-19 at `6,055 billion (about 3 per cent higher than last year), the central government completed 47.6 per cent of its budgeted gross borrowings by end-September 2018 (64.1 per cent in the corresponding period of 2017-18). It decided not to front-load market borrowings in the first half of the year in a departure from the typical pattern of market borrowings (Table III.4). It has 6 In the last three years (2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 RE), growth in nominal GDP has exceeded the growth in combined outstanding liabilities only in 2016-17. As per budget estimates of 2018-19, growth in nominal GDP is expected to outpace the combined outstanding liabilities. decided to reduce its budgeted market borrowings in the second half of the year by `705 billion, which will take the market borrowings for the full year to `5,350 billion against the budgeted `6,055 billion. The government expects that higher inflows in the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) scheme and adjustments in buyback programme would enable it to meet the budgeted fiscal deficit target even with lower market borrowings. The states completed 27.6 per cent of their budgeted gross borrowings by end-September 2018 as against 36.7 per cent in the corresponding period of 2017-18. The bulk of market borrowings by the states would be in the second half of 2018-19. A major challenge for government finances is adherence to the budgeted revenue expenditure, given impending elections in several states as well as for the centre. An analysis of GFCE growth for the period 1991-92 to 2017-18 suggests that it generally picks up in election years (Chart III.15). This highlights the risks of curtailment of capital expenditure and/ or deviation from the GFD targets. There are also risks of overshooting of revenue expenditure in the current year due to potential outlays associated with food and fuel subsidies for the centre, debt waivers for states, and the announced increase in minimum support price (MSP) for kharif crops. However, the government has indicated that it does not anticipate any slippage in the fiscal deficit target and expects the revenue collection to be in line with the budget estimates. Revenue mobilisation through better tax compliance, non-tax revenues and disinvestment holds the key to sustaining fiscal consolidation by the centre. State finances are likely to be under pressure during the current fiscal year due to rollout of farm loan waivers and implementation of impending pay commission awards and arrears. Net exports continued to drag down aggregate demand in Q1:2018-19, though on a smaller scale than in the previous four quarters. India\u2019s merchandise exports recovered smartly from the implementation effects of the GST and rode on improving global demand to expand at 14.6 per cent in US dollar terms in Q1:2018-19, a step-up from the average of 10.1 per cent in the previous four quarters (Chart III.16a). The recovery in export growth was strongly supported by non-oil exports such as engineering goods, chemicals and drugs and pharmaceuticals (Chart III.17a). Oil exports too expanded, but mainly on the back of a surge in international crude oil prices. Merchandise import growth during Q1:2018-19 was the slowest in four quarters on account of an unfavourable base effect and a decline in gold imports. There was also some moderation in non-oil non-gold imports with the decline in imports of pearls and precious 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A 6 1 - r p A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A Note: Growth rate for July 2018 in Chart b is calculated based on the monthly average of the corresponding period. stones, pulses and vegetable oil (Chart III.17b). The combined impact of the escalation in international crude oil prices and a pick-up in import volumes pushed up the oil import bill to a 15-quarter high. Notwithstanding the improved export performance, India\u2019s merchandise trade deficit during Q1:2018-19 was the highest in last 20 quarters. During July-August 2018-19, both export and import growth improved. Exports benefitted from increased shipments of petroleum products, engineering goods and gems and jewellery. Petroleum, gold, coal and electronic goods supported import growth. In Q1:2018-19, 65 per cent of India\u2019s merchandise trade deficit was financed through invisibles, i.e., net export of services, income and remittances. Net services exports grew by 2.1 per cent on a y-o-y basis, primarily driven by exports of software and financial services. In gross terms, India\u2019s services export recorded a growth of 4.9 per cent in Q1:2018-19 (Chart III.16b). India accounts for a large share (13.1 per cent share in total exports of the top 10 exporting economies)7 of global exports of telecommunications, computer and IT companies reported significant improvement in their export revenues in Q1:2018-19, which might also have extended into Q2:2018-19 in view of the weakness of the rupee. Optimistic forecasts of global IT spending in 2018 also bode well for the outlook for software exports. Net remittances \u2013 mainly private transfers, which supplement gross domestic disposable income \u2013 rose by 17.5 per cent in Q1:2018-19, reflecting firmer demand conditions in source countries as also rising international crude oil prices, both of which imply a favourable outlook for these flows. Despite increase in net receipts of services exports trade deficit and caused a slight widening of the current account deficit to US$ 15.8 billion (2.4 per cent of GDP) as compared with US$ 15.0 billion (2.5 per cent of GDP) in Q1:2017-18. The global growth and trade outlook is clouded by rising protectionist tensions. The direct impact of the recently announced tariffs by the US on India\u2019s exports is likely to be modest;8 however, the increase in US tariffs could lead to a supply glut in non-US markets and push prices down, resulting in lower export realisations for third party exporters like India. These risks appear to be materialising as the affected countries retaliate and protect domestic markets as already evident in tit-for-tat tariffs by the US and China. These developments could lead to a global trade slowdown with hysteresis, which, in turn, could diminish welfare, especially for countries looking to leverage on global trade to meet their growth aspirations. As regards financial flows in 2018-19 so far, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows increased by 2.9 per cent in April-July 2018 over the corresponding period of the previous year. By contrast, FPI flows recorded net outflows of US$ 11.5 billion till September 28, 2018, reflecting mainly global portfolio rebalancing away from EMEs. While net receipts on account of non-resident deposits almost tripled in Q1:2018-19 from their level a year ago, both external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and short-term trade credit recorded outflows during the same period. Keeping in view the capital needs of the corporate sector, all-in-cost norms and end-use provisions were rationalised and the list of eligible borrowers was expanded for ECBs in April 2018. Despite the drawdown of reserves since April 2018, India\u2019s forex reserves at US$ 400.5 billion as on September 28, 2018 were at a comfortable level \u2013 equivalent to 10 months of imports and 182 per cent of short-term external debt (by residual maturity). The growth of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices accelerated to an eight-quarter high of 8 per cent in Q1:2018-19 (Table III.5). However, GVA\u2019s momentum, measured in terms of seasonally adjusted q-o-q annualised growth, somewhat weakened, suggesting Agriculture, forestry and fishing Industry Mining and quarrying Manufacturing Electricity, gas, water supply and other utilities Services Construction Trade, hotels, transport, communication Financial, real estate and professional services Public administration, defence and other services GVA at Basic Prices 8 According to the Asian Development Outlook 2018, the estimated direct impact of US tariffs on exports from India works out to be 0.06 per cent of India\u2019s total exports. that favourable base effects were primarily at work (Chart III.18). and allied activities, grew at a robust rate of 8.1 per cent in Q1:2018-19. The acceleration of GVA growth was underpinned by manufacturing activity registering double-digit growth after eight quarters. Agricultural growth also accelerated on the back of double-digit growth in production of key crops during the rabi season, and sustained expansion in livestock products, forestry and fisheries during the quarter. There was some moderation in growth of services sector activity, essentially due to a high base. Construction activity maintained strong pace for the second consecutive quarter. Continued expansion in PADO was fuelled by an increase in government expenditure in Q1:2018- 19 (Chart III.19). fourth advance estimates of agricultural The production for 2017-18 released in August placed foodgrains production at a record high of 284.8 million tonnes, 1.9 per cent higher than the third advance estimates (released in May 2018) and 3.5 per cent higher than the final estimates for the previous year. A record production of cereals for the second consecutive year and higher buffer stocks9 are exerting downward pressure on agriculture prices. The buffer stocks of foodgrains may also pose a logistic challenge for state agencies, including the Food Corporation of India (FCI), unless they liquidate extant stocks through open market sales. The progress of the south-west monsoon had been irregular, notwithstanding its early arrival. Starting Agriculture and allied activities accelerated for the third consecutive quarter in Q1:2018-19, supported by higher production of rice, wheat, coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds during the rabi season. As per the third advance estimates for 2017-18, horticulture production increased by 2.1 per cent, reaching a record of 306.8 million tonnes. The livestock products, forestry and fisheries sub-sector, which constituted around 45 per cent of GVA of agriculture 9 Foodgrain stocking norms (or buffer norms and strategic reserve) refer to the level of stock in the Central Pool that is sufficient to meet the operational requirement of foodgrains and exigencies at any point of time. At present, stocking norms are fixed by the central government on a quarterly basis consisting of operational stock (for meeting monthly distributional requirement under targeted public distribution system (TPDS) and other welfare schemes (OWS) for the quarter) and strategic reserves to take care of a shortfall in production or natural calamities. With effect from July 1, 2017, quarter-wise buffer norm for foodgrains are: 21.04 million metric tonnes as on 1st April, 41.12 million metric tonnes as on 1st July, 30.77 million metric tonnes as on 1st October, and 21.41 million metric tonnes as on 1st January.

The deficit in precipitation (June-September) at 9 per cent (below Long Period Average (LPA)) was higher than a year ago and it remained deficient in 16 out of 17 weeks, with the cumulative peak deficit reaching 10 per cent in some weeks in June, August and September (Chart III.20). As at end-September, 2018, 23 of the 36 meteorological sub-divisions in the country received normal rainfall, one sub-division received excess rainfall and 12 sub-divisions (covering 31 per cent of the meteorological sub-divisional area of the country) received deficient rainfall (Chart III.21). index10 The (PRN) for rice, pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds and cotton in 2018-19 than a year ago may have an adverse impact on eventual production outcomes (Charts III.22 a and b). 10 The All India production-weighted rainfall index (PRN) for a crop (total foodgrains) is constructed as a ratio of the weighted averages of state-wise actual rainfall and IMD normal rainfall, expressed as a percentage. The weights used are based on five year average shares of the state-wise crop (total foodgrains) production. e r a t c e h n o i l l i e s r a o C s l a e r e C s d e e s l i e n a c r a g u S Note: Sowing data for 2017-18 and 2018-19 are based on fourth and first advanced estimates, respectively.

At the commencement of the season, kharif sowing was adversely affected, inter alia, by the delay in the announcement of MSPs, decline in wholesale prices of major food items across mandis on account of bumper harvest and deficient rainfall in major kharif growing states such as Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh. However, sowing recovered significantly by end-August with the announcement of MSPs and improvement in precipitation (Charts III.23a and b). The increase in MSP announced for kharif season 2018-19 ensures a return of at least 50 per cent over the cost of production (as measured by A2 plus FL) for all the crops. The highest percentage increase in MSP over the previous year is for ragi (52.5 per cent), followed by jowar hybrid (42.9 per cent), while the lowest increase is for tur (4.1 per cent) and urad (3.7 per cent). switched to soyabean as its wholesale price increased considerably in 2018 so far. Excessive rainfall in Kerala (cumulative rainfall being 23 per cent above LPA by end-September 2018) has adversely affected plantation crops (viz., tea, coffee, rubber, pepper and Farmers\u2019 sowing decisions might have been influenced more by prevailing wholesale prices rather than the announcement of higher MSPs (Table III.6). For crops such as coarse cereals, pulses and cotton, sowing continues to lag behind in major producing states, despite normal rains \u2013 the prevailing wholesale prices for these crops persist below the MSPs. Sowing in oilseeds increased primarily due to farmers shifting away from pulses and cotton in search of higher returns as market prices of oilseeds have remained firm on policy support in the form of import restrictions. Farmers also seem to have Note: For explanation of A2 plus FL, Chapter II may be referred. Source: Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare, Government of India. cardamom) in the state. Heavy rainfalls also impacted plantation of tea, coffee and rubber in Tamil Nadu, cotton crops in 11 districts of Telangana and paddy and cotton crops in Punjab and Haryana. These developments, along with below normal rainfall in Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch regions in Central India and the East and North-East parts of the country, may pose downside risks, even if only modest, to the outlook for agriculture. Nevertheless, the first advanced estimates of agricultural production for 2018-19 estimated total kharif foodgrains production at 141.6 million tonnes, 0.6 per cent higher than last year. Live storage in 91 reservoirs was nearly 117 per cent of last year\u2019s storage as on September 27, 2018 and 105 per cent of the decennial average, which augurs well for the coming rabi sowing season. Lower storage in western regions will, however, need to be monitored, going forward. eight core industries (40.3 per cent weight in IIP) for April-August 2018 also shows healthy growth.

Petroleum products, motor vehicles, computer and electronic equipments, basic metals and other non-metalic mineral products emerged as key drivers during April-July 2018 (Chart III.24b). The index of turned Electricity generation also gathered steam and supported industrial activity. A rise in power demand, especially from DISCOMs, coinciding with temporary shortfalls in the supply of energy from renewable sources, pushed up the demand for thermal power (Chart III.25). In response, shortages of coal in power plants are being addressed through improved supplies from Coal India Ltd., which has reduced the power deficit. s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e p / 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - r p A Coke and refined petroleum products s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A Sources: Listed companies' filings (2,724 in Q1:2018-19) with the stock exchanges and RBI staff estimates. The sustained firming up of manufacturing activity was also reflected in the robust growth in nominal sales and profits before tax of listed non-government manufacturing companies in 2017-18 (Chart III.26). An analysis of 1,741 listed companies for Q1:2018- 19 also attests to improvement in profitability of manufacturing firms (Chart III.27). Based on the use-based classification, industrial production was driven by sustained acceleration in primary goods, infrastructure/construction goods, capital goods and consumer durables in Q1:2018-19 (Chart III.28). Increased production of diesel, LPG, fertilisers, mining produce and electricity helped push up the supply of primary goods. The production of steel and cement remained buoyant, underpinned by public sector infrastructure projects, including affordable housing, and a pick-up in sales and new launches of residential units. Consumer durables production is being buoyed by strong urban demand. Overall business Indian sentiment manufacturing sector has remained broadly stable.

PADO growth moderated, subdued revenue expenditure (net of interest payments and subsidies) of the Union Government.

Nevertheless, the overhang of unsold inventory and weaker demand conditions continued to have a moderating influence on residential home prices (Chart III.32b). Potential output tends to be driven by the supply of labour and capital and the growth of total factor productivity (TFP).11 Productivity is a key determinant of potential output. The KLEMS12 database suggests that TFP growth in various sub-sectors of industry and services, with relatively higher contributions to overall GVA in the Indian economy, has improved in the post-global financial crisis period, i.e., 2010-11 to 2015-16, vis-\u00e0-vis 2004-05 to 2009-10 (Chart III.33). Kalman filters (MVKF), which can take into account inflation or financial conditions, have been employed for drawing robust inferences on the stage of the business cycle.13 The composite estimate of the output gap, obtained by using principal components analysis on the alternative estimates, suggests that the output gap has virtually closed in Q1:2018- 19 (Chart III.34a). It reflects the acceleration in the pace of domestic demand from the second quarter of 2017-18, with real GDP growth increasing from 5.6 per cent in Q1:2017-18 to 8.2 per cent in Q1:2018-19. Output gap estimates (i.e., the deviation of actual output from its potential level expressed as ratio of potential output) provide a summary indicator of demand-supply conditions. Both potential output and the output gap are unobservable and their estimates can be sensitive to the method of estimation. Hence, a variety of alternative approaches \u2013 univariate filters such as the Hodrick-Prescott filter; the Baxter-King filter; the Christiano-Fitzgerald filter; and multivariate g n i r u d h t w o r g P F T 11 Total factor productivity is attributed to that part of output growth, which cannot be explained by growth in inputs (i.e., labour and capital). 12 KLEMS is an acronym for capital (K), labour (L), energy (E), materials (M), and services (S).

Source: RBI staff estimates. The output gap dynamics are also consistent with the uptick in capacity utilisation (seasonally adjusted) in the manufacturing sector. The finance-adjusted output gap remained marginally positive in Q1:2018- 19, driven by growth in overall credit and equity prices (Chart III.34b). The recovery in economic activity, which began in Q2:2017-18, seems to be robust. Consumption is expected to remain resilient, buoyed by rising income levels and staggered implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award at the states\u2019 level in the urban areas. Rural consumption is likely to remain strong in view of the sizeable hike in MSPs and debt waivers by the states. The record agricultural production achieved in recent years, is expected to be maintained on the back of a hike in MSPs of kharif crops, normal monsoon rains in most of the kharif crop growing regions of the country and comfortable water reservoir storage. Easier supply conditions in the agrarian economy support backward and forward linkages and thereby brighten the prospects for the manufacturing and services sectors. Upbeat construction activity, fading away of the slack in banking sector financial intermediation activities, and higher public expenditure in an election year, suggest that stability of services sector growth would be maintained. A more durable momentum in investment activity holds the key to sustaining the Indian economy on the higher growth path that has become evident in the last two quarters. Rising capacity utilisation and improving credit offtake bode well for investment gaining traction. The deteriorating global trade and geo-political environment are, however, negative risks to the investment outlook. Domestic financial market segments exhibited divergent movements in the first half of 2018-19. Money markets experienced liquidity swings while the government securities and foreign exchange market segments were impacted by global spillovers. The stock market scaled new highs on buying support from domestic mutual funds. In the credit market, bank lending gained traction amidst some tightening of financing conditions. Global financial markets were unsettled during the first half of the year by bouts of turbulence stirred up by the collision of the ongoing normalisation of monetary policy, elevated and volatile crude oil prices, geopolitical tensions and country-specific stresses. While equity markets in advanced economies (AEs) remained buoyant and undeterred by rising interest rates in the United States (US), yield curves in bond markets continued to flatten as term spreads declined. The US dollar strengthened persistently up to mid- August, leading to across-the-board depreciation of the currencies of emerging market economies (EMEs), with marked declines in some of them. As investors turned risk-averse towards EMEs as an asset class, capital outflows became pronounced, leading to corrections in their equity markets, hardening of bond yields, and increase in credit spreads. For some EMEs, country-specific factors accentuated the decline in asset prices and exodus of capital flows. Different segments of the domestic financial market were impacted divergently by global spillovers and local developments. Overnight money markets remained immune and interest rates traded below the policy repo rate, notwithstanding oscillating liquidity conditions and two policy rate hikes in June and August. Interest rates on Treasury Bills (T-Bills), on the other hand, hardened synchronously with the spectrum of gilt yields up to the longer end, reflecting both global developments and perceptions of an oversupply of government paper. Yields on corporate bonds tracked those on government bonds. Equity markets were driven by rallies to new highs as ebullient domestic institutional investors more than compensated the sell-off by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), though there have been recent signs of a broad-based correction. The exchange rate of the rupee came under sporadic bouts of pressure due to capital outflows by FPIs and widening of the trade deficit. Overall, the depreciation of the Indian Rupee (INR) was \u201cmiddle of the pack\u201d in comparison with EME currency peers. Credit flows from banks gathered momentum and became broad-based even as several banks increased their lending rates to reflect the strengthening demand for bank credit and moderation of surplus liquidity in the system. As alluded to above, there was a marked differentiation in the drivers of activity in the various constituents of the domestic financial market continuum. While the foreign exchange and bond segments were affected by the adverse mix of global developments, equity markets were a notable outlier, cushioned by domestic bullishness. Likewise, the money and credit markets were unaffected by global factors, the former insulated by persisting albeit shrinking systemic surplus liquidity and the latter by a steady revival of domestic demand. IV.1.1 Money Market: Systemic liquidity underwent in H1:2018-19. Substantial alternating phases surpluses in April and May gave way to deficits for a brief period from mid-June to July 2018 due to advance tax outflows and forex operations of the Reserve Bank. Surplus conditions returned, however, in the first half of August due to increase in government spending, although from August 21 onwards, indirect tax payments whittled down excess liquidity for a brief period. Surplus conditions returned in the first ten days of September before tightening in the second half on account of advance tax outflows. Average daily net liquidity absorbed through the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) turned from `496 billion in April to a net injection of `107 billion in July before switching back into net absorption of `30 billion in August. The liquidity deficit in the second half of September resulted in daily net injection of liquidity throught the LAF to the tune of `406 billion. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded generally below the policy repo rate (Chart IV.1). The negative spread of the WACR over the repo rate increased from 11 bps in April to 15 bps in August (notwithstanding some intermittent moderation in May and July) before moderating to 4 bps in September. Overall, the WACR, on average, remained 10 bps below the policy rate in H1: 2018-19 (Chart IV.2). s t n i o p s i s a B In money markets, both rates and volumes have institutional and policy changes adjusted introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). For instance, the width of the policy corridor, which was 200 bps in May 2011, was progressively reduced to 50 bps by April 2017 as a part of ongoing refinements of the operating procedure of monetary policy. Empirical research and international evidence suggest that the width of the corridor is positively related to volatility \u2013 a wider corridor is associated with higher volatility in the inter-bank market and vice versa (Bindseil and Jablecki, 2011).1 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A In India, the narrowing of the corridor has moderated volatility \u2013 measured by the exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) of the inter-bank call rate \u2013 significantly, corroborating the cross-country experience (Chart IV.3).2 y t i l i t a l o V 2 As a measure of volatility, the EWMA is an improvement over simple variance as it assigns greater weight to more recent observations. Thus, EWMA expresses volatility as a weighted average of past volatility where the weights are higher for more recent observations. 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A ; and CCIL ; and CCIL This has, however, not produced any significant adverse impact on volumes in the uncollateralised segment \u2013 the share of the call money market in the total inter-bank overnight market turnover remained broadly unchanged at less than 10 per cent (Chart IV.4). In terms of market microstructure, private banks and primary dealers (PDs) are the major borrowers in the overnight call money market, while co-operative banks and public sector banks are the major lenders. In the collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (CBLO) segment (which constitutes more than 60 per cent of the overnight market), banks are usually borrowers, while mutual funds (MFs) are major lenders. The share of MFs in CBLO lending, which had gone up to 80 per cent in March 2017 in the wake of demonetisation, gradually ebbed and stabilised at an average share of 64 per cent in H1:2018-19. In the collateralised market repo segment (which constitutes about 30 per cent of the overall overnight market turnover), MFs are major lenders, followed by foreign banks. On the other hand, PDs are the largest borrowers in this market, followed by foreign banks. During H1:2018-19, interest rates in both the collateralised segments, i.e., CBLO and market repo were, on an average, below the WACR by ten bps and three bps, respectively (Chart IV.5). Turnover in the three overnight segments undergoes marked intra-day variations. Foreign banks and PDs \u2013 major borrowers in the market repo segment \u2013 meet around 80 per cent of their funding requirements for government securities (G-sec) trades during the first hour i.e., 9:00-10:00 am, even though the market is open up to 2:30 pm (T+0 settlement). The concentration of trading activity in the first hour implies thin trading for the rest of the day, which increases intra-day volatility and spillovers on to other overnight market segments. Transactions of MFs in the CBLO segment are allowed to be routed through designated banks within banking hours (generally up to 2.30 pm) in order to provide adequate time for settlement at designated settlement banks; trading becomes thin thereafter. Consequently, demand spills over to the uncollateralised call money segment \u2013 the only active segment in late trading hours \u2013 often resulting in spikes in call rates. Overnight interest rates in all the three segments trade at elevated levels in the early hours as most market participants rush to bridge liquidity ) s p b ( n o i t a i v e d d r a d n a t S Note: Based on data for April 1\u2013September 29, 2018. Source :s CCIL; mismatches. Competitive trading in the morning hours narrows interest rate differentials across segments (Chart IV.6a). Volatility in call and the CBLO rates is also the lowest in the early hours (Chart IV.6b). Subsequently, as volumes dip and volatility rises, interest rates decline, though at different speeds, reflecting segment-specific factors. For instance, activity in the call money market in the afternoon is largely driven by co-operative banks, which typically lend at lower rates than the prevailing call rate, leading to higher volatility. deficit in July, fresh issuances of CDs also increased to \u2013 as compared with `1,420 billion in H1:2017-18 \u2013 accompanied by higher rates. After the policy rate hike in August 2018, the 3-month CD rate inched up Movements in CP rates were similar, but they traded for working capital needs, in view of the relatively longer tenor money market Interest rates on instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial papers (CPs) and 91-day Treasury Bills (T-Bills) moved disparately during H1:2018-19. Interest rates on CDs (3-month maturity) moderated at the beginning of April due to liquidity conditions turning into surplus with the unwinding of large government cash balances. However, they hardened until the first week of June, i.e., from 6.80 per cent at end-March 2018 to 7.91 per cent as on June 5, 2018 (Chart IV.7). In its June policy announcement, when the RBI provided a deeper carve-out from the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) to meet the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), 3-month CD rates softened by about 37 bps as banks\u2019 requirements of bulk deposits waned. As surplus liquidity shrank in June and turned into costlier bank loans, and as a way of keeping marginal funding costs low in non-bank financial companies. Amount of CP issuance surged and interest rates on CPs hardened through H1:2018-19. In particular, issuances of CPs increased from `9,316 billion in H1:2017-18 to `12,456 billion in H1:2018-19 (up to September 15, 2018). After the June policy announcement, 3-month CP rates declined by about 30 bps tracking the decline in CD rates. Similarly, the 3-month CP rate declined by about 15 bps after the August policy announcement (Chart IV.7). The 91-day T-Bill rate was elevated through Q1 and following the increase in the policy rate in June, it edged up by two bps. After the rate hike in August 2018, it inched up further by about four bps. company has witnessed a series of rating downgrades since August 2018 and a succession of defaults on its CPs, non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and bank loans. Consequent to the default by IL&FS on its obligations on September 14, 2018, the weighted average discount rate on CPs increased in general, and that for non banking financial companies (NBFCs), in particular. In the secondary CP market, the 3-month CP rate jumped from around 7.8 per cent at the beginning of September to 8.15 per cent on September 21, 2018, triggered also by sales of NCDs at steep discounts by an individual mutual fund on September 21, 2018, and further to 9.0 per cent on September 26, 2018. The RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued press releases on September 23, 2018 indicating that they are closely monitoring recent developments in financial markets and are ready to take appropriate actions, if necessary. Yields softened by 40 bps by end-September. Based on the assessment of prevailing liquidity conditions, liquidity needs going forward and the expansion in currency in circulation, the RBI has taken several measures to inject liquidity into the system in the second-half of September (Box IV.1). The RBI conducted two back-to-back open market operation (OMO) purchase of government securities for an aggregate amount of `100 billion each on September 19 and September 27, 2018. The RBI conducted several variable rate repo of longer tenors under the LAF during September 2018 in addition to the regular 14-day variable rate repos in order to provide a liberal infusion of liquidity. September 27, 2018 The RBI decided to permit banks with effect from October 1, 2018, to reckon government securities held by them up to another 2 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), under the facility to avail liquidity for liquidity coverage ratio (FALLCR) within the mandatory SLR requirement, as Level 1 high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for computing their LCR. Hence, the carve-out from SLR, under FALLCR will now be 13 per cent, taking the total carve out from SLR available to banks to 15 per cent of their NDTL. The RBI clarified that there was ample liquidity surplus in the system and that, going forward, it would stand ready to meet the durable liquidity requirements of the system through various available instruments depending on its dynamic assessment of the evolving liquidity and market conditions. The RBI decided to conduct purchase of government securities under OMOs for an aggregate amount of `360 billion in the month of October 2018. The auctions would be conducted during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th week of October. The RBI retains the flexibility to change the amount, depending on the evolving liquidity and market conditions. IV.1.2 Government Securities (G-sec) Market: G-sec yields eased at the beginning of 2018-19, with market sentiment buoyed by several positive developments, viz., (i) announcement of reduced market borrowings in the Union Budget along with the decision by the central government not to front load issuances in the first half of 2018-19; (ii) the RBI allowing banks to spread out mark-to-market (MTM) losses incurred during Q3:2017-18 and Q4 of 2017-18, over four ensuing quarters; (iii) no change in the repo rate by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in the April 2018 policy; and (iv) a downward revision in the inflation forecast for H1:2018-19. The softening of yields by 16 bps, however, proved transitory and they hardened by 44 bps in end-April on account of several factors such as (i) the release of larger than expected borrowing calendar for state development loans (SDL); (ii) rising international crude oil prices; (iii) inflation concerns due to the revised formula for minimum support price (MSP) as announced in the Union Budget 2018-19; (iv) depreciation of the rupee; (v) rising trade protectionism; and (vi) MPC minutes which flagged upside risks to inflation. Yields softened by 19 bps in the first week of May after the announcement of OMOs by the RBI and the decision to lift the three-year maturity cap on foreign portfolio investment (FPI) along with an increase in the overall FPI limit. Yields hardened again, however, by 31 bps in the remaining part of May on account of several factors such as (i) the firming up of US treasury yields to 3.0 per cent (first time since January 2014); (ii) the unrelenting rise in global crude oil prices breaking through the three and a half year peak; (iii) a higher than expected April CPI inflation print; and (iv) concerns on the pace of US Fed rate hikes. In June, the sentiment was initially boosted by higher than expected gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the January-March print. Thereafter, G-sec yields increased in sync with the repo rate hike of 25 bps. Bearishness set in on rising global crude oil prices and a depreciating Indian Rupee (INR), which posed risks to the domestic inflation outlook. The benchmark 10-year G-sec yield closed at 7.90 per cent on June 29, 2018, with overall benchmark yields rising by 57 bps during Q1:2018-19. The G-sec market traded with a softening bias up to August 21, 2018, reflecting the easing of crude oil prices on expectation of increased supplies, lower than expected June inflation print and the announcement of OMO purchases. Yields, however, hardened in end-August tracking the rebound in crude oil prices and depreciation of the INR. The 10-year benchmark yield fell to 7.77 per cent in July and moderated further in the first week of August, driven down by a decline in crude prices. Notably, the 10-year benchmark yield fell by seven bps on August 1 on positive global cues, despite the rate hike by the RBI on the same day. In sync with the depreciation of the INR, however, yields peaked to a high of 8.11 per cent on September 11, 2018. Despite high volatility witnessed during the month which tracked the movements in crude oil prices and INR, yields softened towards the month end and closed at 8 per cent on September 28, 2018, reflecting the measures taken for containing INR volatility along with expectations of lower market borrowings by the central government in H2:2018-19 (Chart IV.8). Higher inflation print, rate hike in USA, rising crude oil prices and depreciating Indian currency n o i l l i B Inflation concerns and rising crude oil prices 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A The yield curve has undergone level shifts in H1:2018-19 in response to global spillovers as well as domestic factors such as near-term inflation outlook and monetary policy measures (Chart IV.9). The rate hike of June resulted in a parallel upward shift in the yield curve, especially in the 2-year to 16-year segment, while the August rate hike induced a downward shift, in line with softening crude oil prices. due to redemption pressure arising out of past issuances. The weighted average spread of SDLs\u2019 cut-off over the corresponding tenor G-sec yield moderated to 53 bps in H1:2018-19 from 63 bps in H1:2017-18 (Chart IV.12). The average inter-state spread on securities of 10-year tenor during H1:2018- 19 was at four bps, lower than nine bps in H1:2017- 18. The maximum inter-state spread peaked at 23 bps on April 10, 2018. FPIs remained net sellers in the G-sec market during the most part of H1:2018-19, but turned net buyers in July and August (Chart IV.10). FPIs made net sales of `274.17 billion in the G-sec segment, including `30.88 billion in state development loans (SDLs). At the shorter end of the primary market segment, yields on treasury bills tracked the benchmark 10-year G-sec yield and hardened during H1, also reflecting the increase in the policy rate by 25 bps each in June and August, concerns on liquidity, and depreciation pressure on the INR (Chart IV.11). s y a d 4 1 At the longer end, the issuance of SDLs was moderate during H1:2018-19. State government market borrowings, however, are expected to go up in H2 spreads on State Bank of India and ICICI Bank papers in an environment of rising global uncertainty. n o i l l i B r p A 0 1 r p A 7 1 r p A 4 2 y a M 3 0 y a M 8 0 y a M 5 1 y a M 2 2 y a M 9 2 g u A 7 0 g u A 0 2 g u A 8 2 yields have largely tracked G-sec yields (Chart s t n i o p s i s a B Average daily turnover in the corporate bond market declined marginally to `71.3 billion during H1:2018- 19 from `73.0 billion during the corresponding period of the previous year. The surge in bond yields induced corporates to shift to bank credit for meeting their funding requirements. Consequently, resource mobilisation through issuances of corporate bonds in the primary market declined by 31.3 per cent to `1,906 billion during April-August 2018 from `2,773 billion during the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart IV.13b). The bulk of resource mobilisation continued to favour the private placement route \u2013 89 per cent of the total mobilisation from the corporate bond market. Investments by FPIs in corporate bonds declined to `2.01 trillion at end-September 2018 from `2.24 trillion at end-March 2018. Consequently, FPIs\u2019 utilisation of the approved limit for investment in corporate bonds declined sharply to 75.5 per cent at end-September 2018 from 91.9 per cent at end-March 2018. hardened significantly by 81 basis points to 8.78 per 8.86 per cent in Q2. The yield spread of 5-year AAA corporate bonds over 5-year G-secs increased sharply by 21 basis points during H1:2018-19, reflecting perceptions of heightened credit risk, which was also corroborated by higher credit default swap (CDS) IV.1.4 Stock Market: Exuberance marked the movements in the equity market during the first five months of H1:2018-19, with the BSE Sensex rising sharply to touch a high of 38,897 at close on August 28, 2018 before moderating to 36,227 at end-September s t n i o p s i s a B n o i l l i B 2018, but still registering an increase of 9.9 per cent during H1:2018-19. The Indian equity market generally remained resilient in the face of sell-offs in many emerging market (EM) stocks, with the MSCI- EME index3 declining by 10.5 per cent during the period. The price earnings (P/E) ratio of Indian equity, which is an indicator of stock market valuation, has generally remained above the P/E ratios of other EM and AE stocks, indicating that investors are willing to pay a higher price for Indian stocks on higher growth expectations or anticipation of continued domestic inflows into mutual fund investments in equities. The P/E ratio of Sensex increased to 23.7 at end-September 2018 from 22.5 at end-March 2018, which was in sharp contrast to a decline in the P/E ratio in the case of other EM indices (Chart IV.14a and b). The rally in the Indian equity market till mid-July 2018 was primarily restricted to stocks of a few blue- chip companies. This was indicative of investors\u2019 preference for quality stocks in times of heightened global uncertainty. During the period mid-July 2018 to end-August 2018, however, the rally in the equity market became more broad-based, indicative of the widening of buying interest. The equity market witnessed significant correction in September 2018 with the broader indices, viz., BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap, declining more sharply than the BSE Sensex. Overall, the BSE MidCap index and the BSE SmallCap index declined by 7.5 per cent and 15.1 per cent, respectively, during H1:2018-19. After a sharp correction during February and March 2018, market sentiment turned positive in Q1:2018- 19, with the BSE Sensex increasing sharply by 7.4 per cent, mainly on account of a lower-than-expected market borrowing programme of the Centre for H1:2018-19, better than expected corporate earnings performance in Q4:2017-18, positive economic news releases such as buoyant goods and services tax (GST) collections and higher auto sales, and sustained buying by MFs. The sharp rally in April was followed by some correction in the second half of May 2018 on uncertainty relating to the election outcome in Karnataka and trade war concerns. The market moved sideways in June 2018 on continuing trade frictions, surge in crude oil prices and interest rate hike by the US Fed on June 13, 2018, along with indications of two more hikes by the end of 2018 (Chart IV.15a). After this brief interlude, the rally in the equity market resumed during the first two months of Q2: 2018-19 with the BSE Sensex increasing sharply by 9.1 per cent during July-August 2018, mainly on the back of domestic factors such as better corporate n o i l l i B 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A earnings results for Q1:2018-19, Government\u2019s approval of capital infusion into five public sector banks, reduction in GST rates on several items, better than expected GDP growth for Q1:2018-19 and decline in inflation in July and August. While the market underwent some decline in the second week of August mainly on concerns about potential market contagion from the crisis in Turkey, it recovered later in the month, especially after the US Fed Chairman\u2019s speech that reaffirmed a gradual approach to interest rate hikes. During September 2018, however, the market registered significant losses with the BSE Sensex declining by 2418 points (6.3 per cent), triggered by default on its debt obligations by IL&FS, which raised concerns about liquidity shortage in the NBFCs sector. Additionally, lingering concerns relating to trade war between the US and China and sharp depreciation of the INR against the US dollar, in the backdrop of higher oil prices and widening of India\u2019s current account deficit for Q1:2018-19, exacerbated the fall in the equity market. Overall, during Q2:2018-19, the BSE Sensex registered a modest increase of 2.3 per cent. During H1:2018-19, domestic institutional investors, particularly MFs, made net purchases of `529 billion in the equity market, while FPIs made net sales of `287 billion (Chart IV.15b). In the primary segment of the equity market, resource mobilisation through public issues of equity (initial public offers and right issues) increased by 7.9 per cent to `120.3 billion during April-August 2018 as compared with `111.5 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. IV.1.5 Foreign Exchange Market: Since April 2018, the INR traded with a depreciating bias, dipping to a low of `72.81 per US dollar (reference rate) on September 25, 2018. The fall in the INR, however, was no exception as currencies of EMEs \u2013 both current account deficit and surplus countries \u2013 lost value as the US dollar strengthened during this period. In particular, sell-offs by FPIs, the ongoing monetary policy normalisation by the US Fed, and country- specific factors \u2013 China recorded its first quarterly current account deficit in Q1:2018 after 17 years \u2013 drove many EME currencies into depreciation in Q1:2018-19. Subsequently, as concerns over the sell- off in Turkish lira exacerbated in August, several EME currencies plunged to multi-year lows. Global risks for EME currencies also seem to be shifting back to China, boosting safe-haven demand for the US dollar amidst escalating concerns of trade frictions between the US and China. While the INR depreciated by 10.3 per cent vis-a-vis the US dollar between end-March and end-September Chart IV.1 a: Movement of 2018, it was modest in comparison with the depreciation of the Brazilian Real, the South African Rand, the Turkish Lira, the Argentine Peso and the Russian Ruble (Chart IV.16a). The size of depreciation of EME currencies, including the INR, in real effective terms was far modest than in nominal terms (Chart IV.16b). In terms of both the nominal effective exchange the real effective exchange rate rate (REER), the rupee depreciated by 5.6 per cent and 5.0 per cent, respectively, between March (average) and September 28, 2018 (Chart IV.16b and Table IV.1). In the recent period, uncertainty around certain global factors has triggered episodic bouts of volatility in both the G-sec and forex markets in India (Box IV.2). IV.1.6 Credit Market: In the credit market, non- food credit growth accelerated to reach its highest level of the last four years in August 2018 (13.5 per cent), with the momentum offsetting generally unfavorable base effects (Chart IV.17). As of September 14, 2018, non-food credit growth was placed at 12.5 per cent. Credit extended by public sector and foreign banks has been recovering gradually and this was built upon In India, the G-sec and forex markets have turned volatile in recent months, hit by global spillovers that destabilised market sentiments and led to episodic bouts of market volatility (Chart IV.2.1). Following Belke et al. (2016), the impact of uncertainty on market movements has been empirically examined with daily and monthly data for the period January 1, 2009 to July 31, 2018. Accordingly, the following GARCH(1,1) mean and volatility equations were specified: Depvart where, Depvart is the change in daily 10-year G-sec yield or percentage returns on daily exchange rates and VIX capturing uncertainty which is reflected in day-to-day volatility. In the absence of any definitive measure of day-to- day uncertainty, the India VIX, based on NIFTY index option prices, has been used as a proxy (RBI, 2018). A preliminary analysis showed evidence of volatility clustering in yields and exchange rates. The generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model was estimated, which allows conditional variance to depend on its lagged values. In the GARCH (1,1) specification, the mean equation indicates the magnitude and direction of impact of the explanatory variables (one period lagged value of change in G-sec yields or percentage returns on daily exchange rates, log of India VIX index and its lags) on the dependent variable (change in G-sec yields or percentage returns on daily exchange rate). The conditional variance equation helps identify time-varying volatility of the residuals generated from the mean equation. 2 is expressed as a function of the Conditional variance \u03c3 t + = 2 autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) t ) terms. For variance to remain well- ( should be less and behaved and stable, the sum of \u03b1 than 1. Based on daily data, GARCH(1,1) estimates using changes in daily 10-year G-sec yield (\u0394YLD10YR), percentage returns on daily exchange rates (%CEXR) and day-to-day volatility (LVIX) reveal interesting insights. The mean equation suggests that an increase in uncertainty causes hardening of yields and a depreciation of the INR (Table IV.2.1). The sum of coefficients in the variance equation is less than unity, implying that the model is stable. \u03b1 In order to test the impact of uncertainty on G-sec yields and the INR-USD on a monthly frequency, the Note: Figures in parentheses are respective p-values.

(2015) and available from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis was used (Chart IV.2.2). To test the hypothesis of uncertainty impacting the domestic bond and forex markets, a pair- wise co-integrated vector auto-regression (VAR) model was used after checking for stationarity properties of the variables (with logarithmic transformation of all the series, excepting the G-sec yield) for the period January 2009 \u2013 July 2018. These results suggest that the G-Sec yield increases by 16 basis points and INR-USD depreciates by 4.7 per cent for every 10 per cent increase in the policy uncertainty index (LPUI). In order to examine the short-run dynamic relationship, vector error correction models (VECMs) were estimated. The error correction terms for both the explanatory variables have statistically significant negative signs, implying that the underlying mechanisms are convergent and, therefore, correct for disequilibrium. Furthermore, to test the direction of causality, the Granger causality or Block Exogeneity Wald tests based on the VECM were carried out. The null hypothesis that policy uncertainty does not Granger cause 10-year G-sec yield was rejected (at 5 per cent level of significance), while the reverse causality was ruled out, indicating that policy uncertainty uni- directionally causes changes in the G-sec yield. Similar, uni-directional causality was also observed for policy uncertainty to INR-USD (Table IV.2.2). These findings suggest that the impact of policy uncertainty is significant on G-sec yields and INR-USD, both at daily and monthly frequencies, as evident in recent episodes of market volatility. Data were found to be non-stationary in levels but stationary in first differences in the Augmented Dickey- Fuller (ADF) tests. Johansen\u2019s cointegration method revealed existence of pair-wise long-run relationships, viz., (i) between the yield on 10-year G-sec (YLD) and the policy uncertainty index (LPUI); and (ii) between the INR-USD (LEXR) and the policy uncertainty index 4 To measure policy-related economic uncertainty, an index was constructed from three types of underlying components. The first component quantifies newspaper coverage from 10 large newspapers on news articles discussing economic policy uncertainty. The second component draws on reports by the government budget office giving a measure of the level of uncertainty regarding the path that the fiscal authorities will pursue in future. Finally, the third component uses disagreement among economic forecasters about future trends in key macroeconomic data as a proxy for policy-related uncertainty. (See Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis website: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/search?st=Economic+Policy+Uncertainty+Index+for+India for details). s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A 6 1 - r p A 6 1 - g u A 7 1 - r p A 7 1 - g u A 8 1 - r p A 8 1 - g u A during H1:2018-19 (Chart IV.18). Of the incremental credit extended by scheduled commercial banks as of September 2018, 57.3 per cent was provided by public sector banks and 4.1 per cent by foreign banks, which was 29.3 per cent higher and 4.1 per cent, lower respectively, a year ago. Incremental credit flow is also getting increasingly diversified, with services accounting for the highest share (as of July 2018) as against personal loans a year ago (Chart IV.19). Credit growth to industry, which has been positive since November 2017, after more than a year-long contraction, showed significantly improved flows to textiles, mining and quarrying, engineering, and telecommunications. The share of credit to agriculture, however, moderated, which might be indicative of pressures in the farm sector as corroborated by agriculture debt waivers announced in some states. While the overall non-performing assets (NPA) ratio of SCBs moderated in June when compared with end- March 2018, it deteriorated in the case of personal loans and agriculture \u2013 the sectors that received large credit flows in recent years (Chart IV.20a). In contrast, the NPA ratio dipped in June in the case of industry and services as compared with March 2018 (Chart IV.20b). e r a h S Banks\u2019 investments in commercial paper, bonds, debentures and shares of public and private corporates are reflected in non-SLR investment, which picked up in 2018-19 (up to September 14) as against a much smaller increase in the same period a year ago (Chart IV.21). This partly reflects higher issuances this year as also higher returns on these investments. P b. Sectoral Non- erforming ssets a Stressed ssets atio Non erforming ssets atio With increased flow of credit and increase in non- SLR investments, excess SLR maintained by banks moderated, mainly on account of private banks (Chart IV.22). Apart from increased credit offtake from banks, funding flows to the commercial sector from other sources also increased, contributed mainly by foreign direct investment and a more than five-fold increase in issuances of CPs (Table IV.2). Even before the MPC raised the policy rate in June 2018, banks had been increasing their term deposit rates from December 2017 in response to the waning of surplus liquidity in the system. The rise in term deposit rates exerted upward pressure on the cost of funding of banks in Q1:2018-19 and n o i l l i b Note: To avoid the window dressing impact, H1 financial year variations have been computed from mid-March to mid-September, i.e., same number of fortnights and comparableperiodforboth2017-18and2018-19.

This reflected the lack of pricing power among banks as well as some risk aversion as they shifted their exposure away from sectors with high NPAs to less risky sectors. In line with the usual pattern of pricing of credit, commercial banks charged the lowest spread (over and above the base rate or MCLR) for loans to the housing sector and the highest spread for personal loans (other than housing, vehicle and education), which are typically unsecured and are perceived to be relatively riskier (Chart IV.27). In the case of housing loans, the banking sector faces stiff competition from housing finance companies (HFCs), which forces banks to keep spreads at a low level (Chart IV.28). Another factor underlying lower spreads on housing loans is the relatively moderate default rate in this sector. With bond yields rising faster than the median MCLR, AA-and AAA-rated bond yields overshot the 1-year median MCLR from February and June 2018 onwards, s t n i o p s i s a B s t n i o p s i s a B Private sector banks Scheduled commercial banks WALR-oustanding rupee loans WADTDR Scheduled commercial banks s t n i o p s i s a B s t n i o p s i s a B Scheduled commercial banks Scheduled commercial banks respectively.

The amended RBI Act 1934 (2016) requires the RBI to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time, if any, in the public domain. Liquidity management operations by the RBI were aligned with the broad framework spelt in the Monetary Policy Reports of October 2017 and April 2018. During H1, the RBI resorted to fine-tuning variable rate auctions of both repos and reverse repos, in addition to the regular operations. While liquidity amounting to `2,296 billion was injected through variable rate repos of maturity ranging from overnight to 28-day in addition to the regular 14-day repos, liquidity absorption amounting to `15,172 billion was effected through reverse repos of maturity ranging from overnight to 14 days. In view of the need to inject durable liquidity given the e r u t l u c i r g A ) e g r a L ( e r u t c u r t s a r f n I g n i s u o H e l c i h e V n o i t a c u d E s n a o L t r o p x E e e p u R t i d e r C n o i l l i B WALR on outstanding loans f WALR on resh rupee loans Median 1-year MCLR Note: Latest data for WALR pertain to August 2018.

Further, based on an assessment of financial market conditions, the RBI increased FALLCR with effect from October 1, 2018, taking the total carve out from the SLR available to banks to 15 per cent of their NDTL. The increase in FALLCR would supplement the ability of individual banks to avail of liquidity, if required, from the repo market against high-quality collateral. This, in turn, will help improve the distribution of liquidity in the financial system. system (Chart IV.30). Accordingly, the RBI injected liquidity through variable rate repo of various tenors, in addition to the regular 14-day repos, to tide over the liquidity tightness in the second half of June. Based on an assessment of the prevailing liquidity conditions, the drainage of durable liquidity due to forex operations, two OMOs of `100 billion each were conducted by the RBI in May and June 2018. Overall, the surplus absorbed under the LAF moderated progressively during the quarter from an average daily net position of `496 billion in April to `142 billion in May and further to `140 billion in June. including During Q1:2018-19, liquidity conditions remained generally in surplus, reflecting the drawdown of government balances due to transfer of GST proceeds to states in April and higher spending by the central government in June 2018. The unwinding of large government cash balances \u2013 amounting to `1.4 trillion in April \u2013 more than offset the drain on liquidity caused by two other autonomous factors \u2013 currency expansion by `743 billion and forex sales of `140 billion \u2013 during the month. Although government balances continued to unwind in May, the scale of forex sales picked up in May as well as June, and currency expansion continued to be higher than expected, resulting in a liquidity deficit in the During Q2:2018-19, liquidity conditions gyrated. In July 2018, liquidity was generally in deficit due to moderation in government spending (especially in the second half of July) and the liquidity impact of the RBI\u2019s forex sales, necessitating average daily net injection of `107 billion under the LAF (Chart IV.31). Besides, durable liquidity was also injected through OMO purchases amounting to `100 billion in July. The system again moved back into an absorption mode in August (up to August 19) due to increased spending and recourse to ways and means advances (WMA) by the government. Although systemic liquidity turned into deficit, necessitating liquidity injection between n o i l l i B n o i l l i B Outstanding LAF [(+) absoprtion / (-) injection] GoI balances [(+) surplus GoI balance / (-) WMA/OD] August 20 and 30, the RBI absorbed `30 billion on an average daily net basis during the month. The system moved back into surplus from August 31 - September 10 as government spending increased, thereafter, it turned into deficit. As a result, the RBI injected `406 billion on an average daily net basis during September. While durable liquidity needs were met through two OMO purchases amounting to `200 billion in the second half of September, day to day systemic liquidity surplus was managed by the RBI through variable rate reverse repos auctions and occasional liquidity deficits were met through regular 14-day variable rate term repos along with variable rate repos of other tenors. The key driver of liquidity during H1:2018-19 was in government cash balances the movement maintained with the RBI (Chart IV.32). Overall, the system liquidity remained in neutral mode for most part of H1, oscillating between surplus in the first quarter and largely deficit in the second quarter. As a part of the RBI\u2019s continuous efforts to improve monetary policy transmission at the short-end of the money market, scheduled primary (urban) co- operative banks were provided access to the marginal standing facility (MSF), while scheduled state co- operative banks were provided access to both the LAF and the MSF on complying with the prescribed eligibility criteria. Domestic financial markets continue to remain vulnerable to evolving global developments, and especially, volatile capital flows. Unpredictability about the direction of capital flows has rendered market sentiment risk averse and uncertain. By contrast, the equity market has surged on the back of domestic institutional investors, even as there has been some correction in the recent period. Valuations, measured by conventional metric, are stretched, albeit driven by optimism on forward earnings. Elsewhere, credit growth has continued to improve. Going forward, liquidity conditions would be managed consistent with the stated policy objective of aligning the WACR with the policy repo rate and ensuring durable liquidity demands of the economy are met. Ensuring better monetary transmission continues to remain a priority for the RBI. Global growth maintained pace, but asynchronously across regions. World trade growth has slowed down in recent months due to ongoing trade tensions clouding the overall outlook. Inflation pressures are building up in advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) on rising energy prices. Financial markets, particularly in EMEs, remained volatile given the ongoing normalisation of US monetary policy, crude price volatility and geopolitical tensions. Since the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of April 2018, uncertainties have clouded the near term outlook for the global economy on several fronts. First, world trade is showing signs of slowdown with the intensification of trade wars. Second, crude prices are experiencing high volatility at elevated levels and risks of supply disruptions have been slanted to the upside by geopolitical tensions. Third, in some AEs as well as in many EMEs, mainly on elevated energy prices. Consequently, even as global growth has maintained pace, it has diverged amongst regions/ economies \u2013 strong activity in North America and in several parts of Asia and Africa, but a weaker profile in Europe, China, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. inflation pressures are building up in major Turning to macroeconomic conditions economies, annualised real GDP growth of the US surged above 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018 \u2013 the strongest in over three years \u2013 fuelled by tax cuts, robust consumer spending and steadily improving labour market conditions (Table V.1). Industrial output also strengthened, although the outlook is scoured by rising trade tensions. The Euro area slowed down, with weak GDP growth in Q1:2018 extending into Q2. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) has declined during Q3:2018. A similar pattern was observed in other sentiment indicators like consumer confidence and Global financial markets have been unsettled by bouts of high turbulence and volatility, and swings in investor sentiment have become more pronounced in the recent period. A brewing cocktail of the ongoing monetary policy normalisation in the US, escalating trade conflicts and geopolitical tensions, persisting fears of crude price volatility and crisis conditions in some EMEs are intermittently triggering waves of risk aversion with respect to EMEs as an asset class and flight to safety. Equity markets have reflected these swings, scaling new highs in the US but with sharp sell- offs in EMEs. Bond yields spiked in major AEs in April, but softened subsequently on safe haven demand, while they remained elevated in EMEs, impacted by global spillovers, including technical contagion. The US dollar\u2019s persistent appreciation right up to mid- August has translated into currency depreciations in other AEs and EMEs. business sentiment. Capacity utilisation declined in Q3:2018, while the unemployment rate has inched lower during Q3 so far, amidst persisting regional disparities. Political tensions and Brexit concerns, along with the ongoing trade conflicts, pose significant risks to the overall growth outlook. market conditions likely to be growth drivers alongside firm crude prices. South Africa slipped into recession in Q2:2018 on account of the negative contribution from agriculture (due to a very large base effect) and adverse effects of political uncertainties. The Japanese economy expanded at a strong pace in Q2:2018 after contracting in the previous quarter, boosted by a rebound in household consumption and a rise in business spending. Capital expenditure also rose for the seventh quarter in a row. However, weak export orders and subdued business confidence indicate concerns surrounding trade protectionism. Economic activity has weakened in several EMEs. Financial deleveraging has weighed on GDP growth in China in Q2:2018 amidst rising trade tensions, which resulted in a current account deficit during H1:2018, a first in two decades. Weak infrastructure spending and falling retail sales are accentuating the slowdown. The combination of these factors poses major risks to the outlook. Among the other BRICS economies, headwinds from political uncertainties in May were reversed in Brazil in June, but economic activity remained subdued in Q2:2018, reflecting the lingering effects of the recession. In Russia, incoming data suggest that growth momentum was sustained in Q2:2018, supported by strong export growth and retail sales, with private consumption and improving labour In Asia, where growth impulses have remained reasonably resilient to the global turmoil, the Indonesian economy picked up in Q2:2018, driven by private consumption and imports. In Thailand, growth moderated in Q2, pulled down by weaker government consumption although private consumption and strong farm incomes provided an offset. Growth eased in Q2 in Malaysia, dragged down by moderation in exports and strengthening import demand. Turkey is facing major downside risks from exchange rate pressures, geopolitical tensions, a widening current account deficit, soaring inflation, weakening public institutions and sovereign credit rating cuts moving it deeper into \u201cjunk\u201d territory in August. This has heightened rollover risk with regard to US dollar denominated liabilities, especially of its corporate sector. The turbulent external sector outlook for Turkey since early August has had perverse spillovers to other EMEs due to a generalised build-up of risk aversion among investors. The global composite PMI indicates growth slowing down in Q3:2018 across manufacturing and service sectors the major OECD economies, growth is expected to strengthen in the US and Japan, while it is expected to weaken in the UK, the Euro area (including Germany, France and Italy) and Canada. Among major EMEs, the composite leading indicators (CLIs) point to growth strengthening in China, remaining stable in Russia, but weakening in Brazil and South Africa (Chart V.1b). Global trade growth, in real terms, slowed down in 2018 (up to June), although the increase in commodity prices compensated for volume deceleration (Chart V.2a). For AEs, the loss of momentum has been somewhat higher than EMEs. Forward looking indicators suggest that world trade is likely to slow down further in the remaining part of 2018. The World Trade Outlook Indicator (WTOI)1 \u2013 currently above trend \u2013 has eased in the last three quarters, dragged down by slowing export orders, international air freight and container port throughput. Movement in other indicators such as the Baltic Dry Index also point to a moderation in global trade (Chart V.2b). Trade wars weigh heavily on the outlook for global trade. Simulation analysis by the IMF2 suggests that global GDP could be lower by about 0.4 per cent in the first year and by about 0.5 per cent in the second year relative to the baseline. Tariffs on their own have a Global commodity price movements have been driven by commodity-specific demand-supply imbalances, strengthening of the US dollar and ongoing trade tensions. The Bloomberg commodity index declined by 2.6 per cent during April-September 2018. The food price index of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) fell by 3.2 per cent between April and August 2018 on account of a decline in the prices of most food items. International sugar prices, in particular, appear to be set for accentuated contraction due to increased supply from major suppliers on their currency depreciations (Chart V.3a). Crude oil prices surged by 20.0 per cent during April- September 2018. Brent prices rose incessantly between end-June and July on geo-political tensions relating to expected US sanctions on Iran and supply disruptions in Venezuela, Libya and Canada. Prices were also supported by robust demand (Chart V.3b). Base metal prices, measured by the Bloomberg base metal spot index, have fallen by 8.3 per cent between April and September 2018, pulled down by bearish s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P Note: Data for Chart V.2b are 3-month moving averages.

Copper prices, which surged in early June, have dropped substantially on a strong US dollar, trade tensions and expectations of weaker demand triggered by the sell- offs in EMEs. Gold and silver prices have moderated on a resurgent US dollar (Chart V.4). inflation, touched 2.0 per cent in May 2018 and has remained steady since then. Inflation in the Euro area has risen consistently to touch its highest level in 5\u00bd years in July at 2.1 per cent. In Japan, inflation softened during Q2:2018 as rising energy prices were tempered by weak food prices, though an uptick was witnessed in Q3 on rising transport costs (Chart V.5a). Inflation pressures are building up in most AEs and EMEs. Among AEs, CPI inflation in the US has remained steady at above 2.0 per cent since November 2017, supported by the tightening labour market and rising energy prices. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE), the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of Inflationary pressures in EMEs are also rising (Chart V.5b). In Turkey, inflation surged to 24.5 per cent in September, indicating the impact of the sharp currency depreciation. Inflation in Russia touched its highest level in one year in August on rising food prices. In Brazil, inflation has risen during H2:2018 so far due to disruptions in supplies caused by nation-wide strikes in May and hardening energy prices. China\u2019s consumer price inflation rose to 2.3 per cent in August on higher food prices. In Indonesia, inflation remained below the central bank\u2019s target of 3.5 per cent. Monetary policy less accommodative in most AEs and EMEs. The US Fed raised its policy rate thrice in 2018 and investors expect the rate to be raised one more time during this year and three times in 2019 (Chart V.6a). The European Central Bank (ECB) is normalising its monetary policy at a much slower pace; it will end its large scale asset purchase (LSAP) in a staggered manner by the end of 2018. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has continued with its ultra-accommodative stance as inflation has remained well below the target. It tweaked its monetary policy operating procedures in July, providing more flexibility is increasingly becoming to the movement of yields, though the target for the long-term bond yield remains unchanged at zero. in EMEs are getting Monetary policy stances increasingly synchronised, with many central banks either increasing policy rates or keeping them unchanged. Among BRICS countries, Brazil and South Africa kept their policy rates unchanged. Russia raised its policy rate in September 2018, after a hiatus of almost four years, in response to inflationary risks. In Asia, Indonesia raised its policy rate five times since May 2018 to contain the currency\u2019s slide. The People\u2019s Bank of China has left its benchmark one-year lending and deposits rates unchanged since October 2015. However, it raised short-term interest rates in Q1:2018 and eased reserve requirements to free up liquidity in the system in June. Among other EMEs, Turkey has aggressively raised its policy rate by more than 1500 bps this year, cut reserve requirement by 250 basis points across all maturity brackets and lowered reserve requirement ratios for non-core FX liabilities by 400 basis points for up to three-year maturities in August. The central banks of Mexico and the Philippines raised their policy rates during the last two quarters on a worsening inflation outlook (Chart V.6b). Volatility in global financial markets in H1:2018-19 has hit EMEs as an asset class, leading to capital outflows and currency depreciations. Global equity prices have been under presure on waning risk appetite, as geo-political developments across geographies and tightening liquidity conditions have triggered bearish sentiment and rebalancing of portfolios. Among AEs, equity prices have remained under pressure in the Euro area on slowing economic growth, trade tensions and concerns over the impact of the crisis in Turkey. Equity markets in the US have gained, largely driven by the technology sector. Equity indices have been further buoyed by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal in September, despite the ongoing trade tensions. The relatively stronger performance of the US equity market vis-a-vis other AEs and EMEs reflected a flight to safety. In Japan, equity markets have risen encouraged by a weak currency, though subdued business confidence has capped gains. Equity markets in EMEs have declined on a general risk-off sentiment (Chart V.7). f o r e b m u N Global bond markets were visited by bouts of volatility due to a combination of factors \u2013 accelerating US growth and a weakening of economic activity in other AEs; trade tensions; geopolitical events; and expectations around an expansionary fiscal policy in the US. Sovereign bond yields have risen in most AEs and EMEs. 10-year bond yields are rising in the US on strong macroeconomic data, despite the ongoing trade tensions. The global financial crisis (GFC) has revealed that asset prices do not follow a normal distribution, which understates the dynamic nature of volatility. They show fatter tails, implying the occurrence of extreme events, often correlated across various assets. Such Notes: 1. Asset market movements more than one standard deviation away from the mean have been considered as tail events. 2. Data for 2018 are up to August. Source :s Bloomberg; and RBI staff estimates. events have occurred more often in the US 10-year government securities since 2008 than in other asset classes, viz., stocks or commodities. The bond market in the US alone witnessed extreme outcomes several times in 2018. (Chart V.8). In the Euro area, the benchmark 10-year German bond yield moderated on worries over weak economic growth and budget concerns in Italy. In Japan, bond yields, which remained largely range bound during the year, have surged since end-July as the BoJ kept its long-term bond yield target unchanged at around zero per cent (Chart V.9a). Bond yields in EMEs reflected inter alia country-specific factors, though they have risen recently in most countries on expectations of shrinking global liquidity and tighter domestic monetary policy stances. largely by Currency markets have been driven monetary policy systemically important AEs \u2013 particularly in the US, geo-political developments and country-specific factors. The US dollar appreciated between April and September on policy rate hikes thrice during the year, signalling the US Fed\u2019s view that economic activity is growing at a robust clip. The euro lost ground to the US dollar on growth differentials and political tensions in some member states, with the recent Turkish turmoil and significant exposures to Turkey of European banks, exerting downward pressure on the euro. The Japanese yen depreciated driven by widening growth differentials with the US and accommodative monetary policy. Most EM currencies depreciated on capital outflows driven by global spillovers that also impacted bond markets (Chart V.9b). Between April and September 2018, the MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index declined by 7.0 per cent. Contagion from the collapse of the Turkish lira and the Argentine peso led to large depreciations across EM currencies in the second half of August 2018 as correlations with the Turkish lira and Argentine peso increased (Chart V.10). Many bystander central banks among EMEs undertook large scale forex interventions and/or monetary policy measures to contain volatility and calm currency markets. t n e i c i f f e o c n o i t a l e r r o C t n e i c i f f e o c n o i t a l e r r o C Notes: 1. The correlation is based on a 30-day rolling window using daily closing exchange rates of respective currencies vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar. Against the backdrop of episodes of spillover to the EMEs, a comparison of current macroeconomic conditions vis-\u00e0-vis those characterising the taper tantrum of 2013 across five EMEs suggests that although economic fundamentals have generally improved, some weak spots still remain (Chart V.11). P D G f o t n e c P D G f o t n e c n o i l l i b $ S U A noteworthy pattern that has emerged in the period following that commodity prices have a significant bearing on movements in financial markets with strong inter-linkages across is asset classes (Box V.1). This pattern implies important risk in the form of correlated volatility across financial markets, especially for EMEs, from the surging oil prices. The sharp increase in commodity prices, especially of crude oil and base metals since the early 2000s, has led to financialisation of commodities through the rapid development of futures and other derivatives markets. Investors in these markets include banks, institutional investors, insurance companies, pension funds and individuals trying to optimise the risk- return profiles of their portfolios through index trading in derivatives. While doing so, they exploit arbitrage opportunities in commodity derivatives markets. While investment in commodity indices has increased significantly since the early 2000s, the impact of financialisation and risk spillovers has become clearer only after the GFC (European Central Bank, 2011; de Boyrie and Pavlova, 2016). The J. P. Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index4 (EMBI) was taken as proxy for the bond market. As energy prices are more volatile than non-energy prices, a variable representing energy market financialisation, i.e., open active oil contracts (OILAC) was also included in the VAR model. Market volatility and policy-related uncertainty were proxied by the implied volatility of the S&P 500 index options (VIX) and the Economic Policy Uncertainty5 (EPU) index, respectively, as exogenous (pre-determined) variables. As all the endogenous variables were found to be non- stationary of order one, cointegrating relationship between them was examined through a vector error correction model (VECM) and impulse responses were formulated using the reduced form VAR model as given below: Against this backdrop, the dynamic relationship between global energy market and other asset markets was examined in a vector autoregression (VAR) framework using monthly data from January 2001 to July 2018. In order to explore the role of financialisation, the VAR analysis is undertaken for two sub-samples, i.e., January 2001 to July 2008 (pre-GFC period) and August 2009 to July 2018 (post- GFC period). The World Bank energy (WBE) and World Bank non-energy (WBNE) indices were used to represent global commodity prices. The MSCI Emerging Market Equity Index3 (EMEQ) represents the performance of large- and mid-cap securities in 24 emerging markets and the MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index (EMCU) measures the total return of 25 emerging market currencies relative to the US dollar. These two indices were taken as proxies for the equity and currency markets, respectively. Byt-p where p is the order of the VAR model; and yt is the vector of endogenous variables, viz., WBE, WBNE, EMEQ, EMCU, EMBI, OILAC; and Xt is the vector of exogenous variables, viz., VIX and EPU. The restricted cointegration rank tests (trace and maximum eigenvalue) confirm the presence of a single long-run cointegrating relationship among the variables with a lag of two, based on Akaike Information Criteria. The presence of a cointegrating relationship indicates that there exists a long-term relationship between the commodity price movements and other financial asset classes. As a robustness check, the VECM model confirms that residuals are not serially correlated. The reaction of a particular financial market segment to the initial commodity price shocks is examined (Contd...) 3 As of March 2018, this index had more than 830 constituents and covered approximately 85.0 per cent of the free float-adjusted market capitalisation in each country. Over 60 percent weight has been accorded to China, South Korea, Taiwan and India. 4 This sovereign debt benchmark index measures the total return performance of international government bonds issued by EMEs and provides over 50 percentage weight to three Latin American export-oriented economies (Argentina, Brazil and Mexico). 5 See footnote 4, Chapter IV. impulse response functions. Based on through Cholesky decomposition, impulse response analysis reveals that an energy price shock impacts the sovereign bond, currency and equity markets (Chart V.1.1). Bond yields rise due to expectation of tightening of monetary policy following the adverse impact of energy prices on inflation and the impact is found to be somewhat higher in the post-GFC period. Similarly, EME currencies depreciate and the impact is seen to be stronger during the post-GFC period, though the extent of depreciation varies depending on the quantum of imports of energy requirements. Equity markets are found to be affected adversely in the pre-GFC period as higher commodity prices may lower profit margins of corporates due to increase in input costs and also due to higher interest rates as central banks raise rates to contain inflation. In the post-GFC period, however, equity prices increase in the first few months after a shock to energy prices. One reason for this positive co-movement, as argued by Bernanke (2016), could be that both energy and equity prices are \u201creacting to a common factor, namely, a softening of global aggregate demand, which hurts both corporate profits and demand for oil\u201d. Thus, the empirical analysis shows that energy price shocks have impacted the currency and bond markets in EMEs more in the post GFC period vis-\u00e0-vis pre-GFC period, underlining the greater role of financialisation of commodity markets.

More ominously, global trade growth has begun to slow down. The inflation outlook has deteriorated in many AEs and EMEs. These developments taken together will pose a major challenge to global growth prospects in the coming quarters and years. "}
