{"file1": "2. A short while ago, we put out our annual Monetary Policy Statement. Based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, we have decided to:  reduce the repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 50 basis points. The repo rate will accordingly drop from 8.5 to 8.0 per cent. 3. Consequent to this, the reverse repo rate under the LAF, determined with a spread of 100 basis points below the repo rate, gets calibrated to 7.0 per cent. Similarly, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate, which has a spread of 100 bps above the repo rate, stands adjusted to 9.0 per cent. In order to provide greater liquidity cushion, we have also decided to 4. raise the borrowing limit of scheduled commercial banks under the marginal standing facility (MSF) from one per cent to two per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). 5. announcement. These changes have come into effect immediately after the 6. broad considerations. The decision to ease the monetary policy has been informed by two 7. First, growth decelerated significantly to 6.1 per cent in the third quarter of last year, although it is expected to have recovered moderately in the fourth quarter. Based on current assessment, the economy is clearly operating below its post-crisis trend. 8. The second consideration that shaped the policy decision is the decline in inflation. Headline WPI inflation which remained above 9 per cent for nearly two years has moderated significantly to below 7 per cent by March 2012. More importantly, non-food manufactured products inflation has dropped from a high of 8.4 per cent in November 2011 to 4.7 per cent in March 2012, actually coming below 5 per cent for the first time in two years. 1 9. monetary policy stance. These are: The policy document also spells out the three broad contours of our  first, to adjust the policy rates to levels consistent with the current growth moderation;  second, to guard against risks of demand-led inflationary pressures re- emerging; and  third, to provide greater liquidity cushion to the financial system. 10. As in the past, we have also given guidance for the period forward. 11. The reduction in the repo rate is based on an assessment of growth having slowed below its post-crisis trend rate which, in turn, is contributing to a moderation in core inflation. However, it must be emphasised that the deviation of growth from its trend is modest. At the same time, upside risks to inflation persist. These considerations inherently limit the space for further reduction in policy rates. 12. Moreover, if subsidies are not contained as indicated in the Union Budget last month, demand pressures will persist, and will further reduce whatever space there is for monetary easing. Revisions in administered prices may adversely impact headline inflation. But I would like to underscore that the appropriate monetary policy response to this should be based on whether the higher prices translate into generalized inflationary pressures. The likelihood of a pass-through of higher administered prices to generalised inflation depends on the strength of the pricing power in the economy. The pricing power is currently abating, but the risk of a pass-through cannot be ignored altogether. Overall, from the perspective of vulnerabilities emerging from the fiscal and current account deficits, it is imperative for macroeconomic stability that administered prices of petroleum products are increased to reflect their true costs of production. 13. Liquidity management posed a major challenge for much of last year. However, liquidity conditions have eased in recent weeks, and are now steadily moving towards the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank. This is reflected in the decline in banks\u2019 borrowings from the LAF and the behaviour of money market rates. The increase in the MSF limit to banks that we just announced should provide additional liquidity comfort. However, should the situation change, appropriate and proactive steps will be taken with the objective of restoring comfort zone conditions. Expected Outcomes 14. We expect that today\u2019s policy actions, and the guidance that we have given, will result in the following three outcomes: First, growth will stabilise around its current post-crisis trend. Second, risks of inflation and inflation expectations re-surging will be contained. 15. As always, our decision has been based on a careful assessment of the global and domestic macroeconomic situation. Let me begin with our assessment of the global economy. 16. Concerns about a crisis in the euro area have abated somewhat since the Reserve Bank\u2019s Third Quarter Review in January 2012. The US economy continues to show signs of modest recovery. Large scale liquidity infusions by the European Central Bank have significantly reduced the stress in global financial markets. However, a sustainable solution to the euro area debt problem is yet to emerge. Recent developments, for example in Spain, indicate that the euro area sovereign debt problem will continue to weigh on the global economy. 17. Growth also slowed down in emerging and developing economies (EDEs) reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and slowdown in global growth. And, amidst all these, international crude oil prices have risen by about 10 per cent since January and show signs of persisting at current levels. Indian Economy 18. Turning to the domestic macroeconomic situation, economic growth decelerated last year, dropping from 7.7 per cent in the first quarter to 6.9 per cent in the second quarter and further down to 6.1 per cent in the third quarter. This was mainly due to deceleration in industrial growth. Growth in the services sector held up relatively well. On the demand side, gross fixed capital formation contracted both in the second and third quarters of last year. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) put out an advance estimate of 19. GDP growth for last year of 6.9 per cent. More recent data on industrial production suggest that activity may have expanded at a slower pace last year. 20. Looking ahead, the overall growth outlook for the current year looks a little better than it was last year. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank\u2019s baseline projection of GDP growth for the current year is 7.3 per cent. 21. Moving on to inflation, headline WPI inflation, which remained above 9 per cent during April-November 2011, moderated to 6.9 per cent by end- March 2012. This moderation was consistent with the Reserve Bank\u2019s indicative projection of 7 per cent. 22. Food articles inflation continues to be high. Significantly. inflation in protein items is in double digits, reflecting persistent structural demand-supply imbalances in protein foods. 23. Fuel inflation, on the other hand, moderated from over 15 per cent in November-December 2011 to 10.4 per cent in March 2012 even as global 24. Non-food manufactured products inflation decelerated significantly from 8.4 per cent in November 2011 to 4.7 per cent in March 2012, on the back of a slowdown in domestic demand and softening of global non-oil commodity prices. 25. Even as WPI inflation has softened, inflation as measured by the new series of consumer price index (CPI) suggests that price pressures are still high at the retail level. 26. Looking ahead, based on an assessment of the domestic demand- supply balance, global trends in commodity prices and the likely demand scenario, the Reserve Bank\u2019s projection of inflation for March 2013 is 6.5 per cent. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions Let me now move on to monetary and liquidity conditions. Consistent 27. with growth and inflation projections, M3 growth for 2012-13 is projected at 15 per cent. Keeping in view the need to balance the resource requirements of the private sector and the public sector, growth in non-food credit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) is projected at 17 per cent. 28. As I said earlier, liquidity management remained a major challenge for the Reserve Bank during last year. Beginning November 2011, the liquidity deficit went much beyond the comfort level of the Reserve Bank. In order to redress this, we took steps to inject primary liquidity of a more durable nature. We injected liquidity of around `1.3 trillion through open market operations and `0.8 trillion through reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 125 basis points. As a result of these measures and the easing of government\u2019s cash balances, the net borrowing under the LAF, which peaked at `2 trillion at end-March 2012, declined to `0.7 trillion on April 13, 2012. Risk Factors 29. and inflation for 2012-13: Finally, let me highlight the risks to our indicative projections of growth First, a major risk to our growth and inflation projections stems from the outlook for global commodity prices, especially of crude oil. Although upside risks to oil prices from the demand side are limited, geo-political tensions are a concern. Any disruption in supplies is likely to lead to further increase in crude oil prices. The second risk emanates from the fiscal situation. Even though the Budget has proposed a reduction in the fiscal deficit in the current year, there are several upside risks. Any slippage in the fiscal deficit will have implications for inflation. Third, the large Government borrowing budgeted for 2012-13 has the potential to crowd out credit to the private sector. If that happens, the supply response required to accelerate growth could be inhibited. And finally structural imbalances in protein-rich foods persist, and consequently, food inflation is likely to remain under pressure. 30. Since this is the Annual Policy, as per standard practice, it also includes developmental and regulatory policies. Let me briefly indicate some of the important initiatives in this regard. 31. I will begin with financial inclusion. There has been significant progress in providing banking services to villages with population above 2,000. The challenge now is to extend coverage to all the unbanked villages of the level bankers\u2019 country. Accordingly, committees (SLBCs) to prepare roadmaps covering all unbanked villages of population of less than 2,000, and notionally allot these villages to banks for providing banking services in a time bound manner. it 32. The Reserve Bank attaches a lot of importance to customer service in banks. Three measures contained in this policy in this regard are the following: First, banks are being advised to offer a \u2018basic savings bank deposit account\u2019 with certain minimum common facilities and without the requirement of a minimum balance to all their customers. Second, banks will be mandated not to levy foreclosure charges or pre- payment penalties on home loans extended on a floating interest rate basis. Third, banks are being advised to initiate steps to allot a unique customer identification code (UCIC) number to all their customers. 33. Moving on to regulation and supervision, let me highlight some of the important measurers contained in this policy. On Basel III, final guidelines on the implementation of capital regulations will be issued by end-April 2012, and final guidelines on liquidity risk management and liquidity standards by end-May 2012. 34. There has been a significant increase in loans against gold by non- banking financial companies in the recent period, which has raised several concerns. This policy contains three measures to regulate this further: First, banks should reduce their regulatory exposure ceiling to a single NBFC, having gold loans to the extent of 50 per cent or more of its total financial assets, from the existing 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent of bank\u2019s capital funds. Second, banks should have an internal sub-limit on their aggregate exposure to all such NBFCs, having gold loans to the extent of 50 per cent or more of their total financial assets, taken together. 35. We have announced two measures relating to NBFCs. First, the draft guidelines on overseas investment by core investment companies (CICs) will be placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website for public comments by end-April 2012. Second, it has been decided to issue the draft guidelines on the regulatory framework for NBFCs by end-June 2012 based on the recommendations of the Usha Thorat Working Group. 36. Non-performing assets of banks have increased in the recent period. We are mandating banks to put in place a robust mechanism for early detection of signs of distress and take remedial measures. Final guidelines on securitisation will be issued by end-April 2012. 38. Finally, management. let me two measures concerning currency First, with a view to address the issue of counterfeit notes in circulation, banks are advised to ensure that notes received over the counters are re-circulated only after ensuring their proper authentication through machines. Second, keeping in view the extended geographical spread of bank branch network and leveraging on technology, we have decided to channelize the distribution of currency and coins only through currency chests and bank branches. For details of these measures, as also measures that I have not 39. touched upon, I invite you to refer to the full Policy Statement, which is available on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website. Let me now conclude by summarising our macroeconomic concerns. 40. Though inflation has moderated in recent months, it remains sticky and above the tolerance level, even as growth has slowed. These trends are occurring in a situation in which concerns over the fiscal deficit, the current account deficit and deteriorating asset quality loom large. The challenge for monetary policy will thus be to maintain its vigil on controlling inflation while being sensitive to risks to growth and other vulnerabilities. ", "file2": "1. Monetary and liquidity conditions have eased during 2012-13 as cuts in cash reserve ratio (CRR) and policy rates worked through the system. The Reserve Bank cut CRR by 125 basis points (bps) and front-loaded the policy rate reduction by cutting the repo rate by 50 bps in April 2012. It, however, paused at its Mid- Quarter Review in June 2012 factoring in inflation persistence and macro-economic risks that emanated from lack of momentum in fiscal consolidation. Significantly, while there is slack in the economy, inflation remains persistent. Going forward, monetary policy space needs to be created through fiscal adjustment and structural measures to improve supply conditions and boost the investment climate, so that the revival is supported in a non-inflationary manner. Growth in Q1 of 2012-13 is likely to have 2. stayed low after having dropped to a 29-quarter low in the sequentially preceding quarter. While the slowdown has been primarily driven by investment, more recently and to a lesser extent, consumption has also slowed. Global growth prospects have worsened during Q1 of 2012-13, thus putting domestic recovery at greater risk. Inflation, after falling in Q4 of 2011-12 has turned sticky. Price pressures remain with significant suppressed inflation in domestic energy prices and rupee depreciation, which have partly off-set the gains from lower global commodity prices. adjustment of the US economy from the 2008 financial crisis are keeping growth in Advanced Economies (AEs) low. Deceleration in growth in BRICS economies, which have so far been the drivers of growth in Emerging and Developing Economies (EDEs), has worsened global growth prospects further. 4. Global financial market stress eased significantly during Q1 of 2012 after ECB made a large liquidity injection, but was accentuated again by the deepening crisis in the euro area, especially in Greece and Spain. The recent Libor fixing case has also added to the uncertainty by drawing attention to how a few large global financial institutions allegedly manipulated one of the most commonly used market rates. Meanwhile, falling commodity prices and subdued inflation in large economies provided additional space for monetary easing. This fresh round of monetary easing has, however, increased the risks of inflation in EDEs even while inflation is likely to remain subdued in most AEs. Growth risks accentuate, negative output gap likely to persist during 2012-13 Global Economic Conditions Global growth prospects worsen with growth also slowing in EDEs Debt overhang and persistent euro area 3. problems coupled with still incomplete Economic activity slowed down 5. considerably during Q4 of 2011-12 and has likely stayed weak during Q1 of 2012-13. Growth in 2012-13 is likely to remain below potential. Newer risks to growth have arisen from slowing global trade, domestic supply bottlenecks of industrial inputs, coal and electricity and less-than-satisfactory monsoon so far. Services growth is also showing signs of slowing in line with slowing industrial growth and weak global economy. as increased debt flows bridge financing gap. As a result, external vulnerability indicators may deteriorate and would make economy susceptible to external shocks unless trade balance is compressed and FDI flows improve. Aggregate Demand Need for curtailing subsidies and propelling a government investment stimulus to address investment slack 6. Aggregate demand weakened further during Q4 of 2011-12. The investment slowdown seen since H2 of 2010-11 has extended to Q4 of 2011-12. Apart from the sharp fall in investment, private consumption moderated during Q4 of 2011-12. Fiscal and monetary space to stimulate the economy remain limited in the presence of an already large fiscal deficit and persistent inflation. The fiscal deficit target for 2012-13 is at a risk of being breached due to likely overshooting of subsidies and shortfall in receipts. To address this risk, fiscal space needs to be created by curtailing subsidies and significantly boosting government capital expenditures to provide an investment stimulus to the economy, which would help crowd-in private investment. External Sector CAD risks and concerns about sustainability persist Monetary and Liquidity Conditions Monetary and liquidity conditions ease during 2012-13 8. A 50 basis points (bps) rate cut, following a 125 bps CRR reduction, coupled with active open market operation purchases have significantly eased monetary and liquidity conditions during 2012-13 so far. While these measures are supportive of growth, the rate of deposit expansion has slowed which could adversely affect liquidity. Credit growth has picked up in the current financial year and is in line with the indicative projections. The flow of resources from non-bank sources has also been good. In spite of a relative improvement in monetary and liquidity conditions during Q1 of 2012-13, the Reserve Bank would need to closely monitor the liquidity and monetary conditions ahead so that they remain consistent with the evolving growth-inflation mix. Financial Markets Currency and equity markets remained under pressure 7. Softening of global crude oil prices and moderation of gold imports may bring some relief to the balance of payments, but Current Account Deficit (CAD) risks remain significant for 2012-13. Slowing global growth and trade are likely to keep expansion in exports of goods and services low. Services exports net of services imports have declined notably in Q1 of 2012-13. With lower growth, the sustainable level of CAD has also come down to around 2.5 per cent of GDP. Financing a large CAD may pose difficulties in face of slowing foreign investment flows. External debt is likely to rise 9. Spillovers from global financial market uncertainties and waning investor confidence amidst deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, kept domestic currency and equity markets under pressure. The rupee depreciated by nearly 10 per cent during Q1 of 2012-13, before staging some recovery in July 2012. Equity markets remained range bound, with sharp gains in May 2012 being nullified during June 2012. Money market rates and G-sec yields eased reflecting improved liquidity and falling global commodity prices. However, going forward, financial stress is likely to remain with falling earnings and high leverage for non- financial firms. Price Situation Inflation pressures persist despite weakening growth momentum 10. Headline WPI inflation persisted above 7 per cent, while consumer price inflation, as per the new CPI, remains in double-digits. Inflationary pressures have persisted, with significant contribution from food and energy segments. Going forward, the decline in global commodity prices will provide some relief, but the gains have been partly offset by rupee depreciation. While core inflationary pressures are currently muted, a continued rise in real wages could spill over to core inflation. Persistence of inflation, even as growth is slowing, has emerged as a major challenge for monetary policy. Macroeconomic Outlook Outlook remains weak, need to support recovery in a non-inflationary manner 11. Growth risks in 2012-13 have been amplified by decelerating global trade and domestic supply constraints. At the same time, inflation risks remain significant due to suppressed inflation, poor supply responses and deficit monsoon conditions. Various surveys suggest that business and consumer confidence remain low. Revival of investor confidence would, therefore, need to be supported by addressing concerns over policy stasis, while putting in place complimentary actions that address macro-economic weaknesses. The Indian economy grew at a slower pace than its potential in 2011-12. Growth slowed down in all three sectors of the economy through the course of the year. Moderation in industrial growth persisted in the midst of domestic supply constraints, a clouded domestic policy environment and a deteriorating external outlook. The services sector also under-performed given its inter-linkages with the industrial sector. The available information suggests that slowdown has extended into Q1 of 2012-13, and output expansion in 2012-13 is likely to stay below the potential. Persistent euro area problems and weakening growth in EDEs may drag global growth in 2012 I.1 Global growth, which was better than expected during Q1 of 2012, weakened sharply during Q2 mainly due to increased uncertainties in the euro area and dampened demand conditions in emerging and developing economies (EDEs). Global growth projection for the year 2012 by the IMF (World Economic Outlook Update, July 2012) is 3.5 per cent. The growth projection for the EDEs has been revised downward (by 0.1 per cent from the earlier projection in WEO, April 2012) to 5.6 per cent. The deceleration in growth in the BRICS I.2 nations, which have so far been drivers of EDEs\u2019 growth, has added a new dimension to the global slowdown, making near-term recovery difficult. Growth in China, India, Brazil and South Africa has decelerated since 2011, while that in Russia has been low since 2008. I.4 The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report on US manufacturing suggests a contraction in economic activity in the manufacturing sector in June 2012 (PMI of 49.7), the first time since July 2009. The uncertainty over the path of fiscal policy, which is set to tighten abruptly at the beginning of 2013 or what is termed the \u2018fiscal cliff\u2019, could further weaken the US growth later this year. Even though Germany recorded 0.5 per cent q-o-q growth in Q1 of 2012 (as against a contraction in Q4 of 2011), business sentiment fell for the second consecutive month in June to a two-year low. The UK economy witnessed its third consecutive quarterly contraction as the preliminary estimates indicate 0.7 per cent q-o-q decline in GDP in Q2 of 2012. I.5 In the US, the uptick in the unemployment rate to 8.2 per cent since May 2012 has compounded the sense that the economy is The euro area crisis has strongly affected I.3 the global economic outlook through effects on confidence as well as trade and capital flows. While economic activity in the euro area diminished or stagnated in Q4 of 2011 and Q1 of 2012, the US economy grew at a modest pace (Chart I.1). As per advance estimates, US growth decelerated to 1.5 per cent in Q2 of 2012. Even though the Japanese economy expanded at an annualised rate of 4.7 per cent in Q1 of 2012, it may slow down ahead as the impact of reconstruction spending wears off. going through a sluggish patch. The unemployment rate across the euro area rose to a new high of 11.1 per cent in May 2012, the highest level since records began in January 1995 (Chart I.2). The unemployment rate for people below the age of 25 was even higher at 22.6 per cent. According to the OECD, the unemployment rate in the advanced economies (AEs) will stay high till the end of 2013. I.6 The weak economic activity in the AEs is impacting the EDEs. The reduced demand for exports and weak capital flows combined with their own domestic policy shortcomings has resulted in subdued economic performance in the EDEs, especially in the case of India and Brazil. China\u2019s growth in Q2 of 2012 fell to a three-year low of 7.6 per cent. Dampening trade volume growth is affecting EDEs exports I.7 The slowing growth of the AEs and EDEs has resulted in significant cooling of international trade in Q2 of 2012 after a modest rebound in Q1 of 2012. World trade growth decelerated from its peak of 20 per cent (CPB World Trade Monitor Index) in May 2010 to as low as 2.3 per cent in April 2012 (Chart I.3). The downturn in Europe and resultant fall in import demand has adversely affected the EDEs as the EU constitutes their single largest market. There was a sharp deceleration in both China\u2019s exports and imports during H1 of 2012 to 9.2 per cent and 6.6 per cent, respectively (23.9 per cent and 27.9 per cent in H1 of 2011). Continued deceleration of imports into China does not augur well for other EDEs. I.8 The sequential slowdown in growth witnessed in the first three quarters of 2011-12 persisted with the fourth quarter registering growth of 5.3 per cent (Table I.1). This was the lowest y-o-y growth in any quarter of the previous seven years, including the crisis year of 2008-09. The sharp slowdown in growth in Q4 of 2011-12 is largely attributable to the contraction in value added in the manufacturing sub-sector and deceleration in most services sub-sectors. The downturn reflects the continued high inflation as well as the impact of other adverse global and domestic macro-economic factors. For 2011-12 as a whole, growth decelerated sharply to 6.5 per cent from 8.4 per cent in the previous two years. The potential growth rate, which is the I.9 maximum rate of growth that the economy can sustain without creating macroeconomic imbalances, moderated during 2009-10 to 2011- 12 from around 8.0 per cent to around 7.5 per cent (Chart I.4). The output gap was positive during 2009-10 and 2010-11. With the growth rate declining by nearly 2 percentage points in 2011-12, reflecting the impact of both cyclical 1. Agriculture & allied activities 2. Industry 2.1 Mining & quarrying 2.2 Manufacturing 2.3 Electricity, gas & water supply 3. Services 0.8 4. GDP at factor cost (Total 1 to 3) : Quick Estimates. #: Revised Estimates. Source: Central Statistics Office. as well as structural factors, the output gap turned negative during 2011-12. Growth momentum remains weak as is evident from low q-o-q SAAR numbers (Chart I.5). Deficient monsoon likely to impact kharif crops I.10 Foodgrain production in 2011-12 rose by 5.2 per cent from the previous year to an all-time high of 257.4 million tonnes. As per the fourth advance estimates of foodgrain production, there was record output of rice, wheat, cotton and sugarcane. In 2012-13, even though the south-west monsoon arrived on time along the coast of Kerala during the first week of June 2012, its progress to the rest of the country has been slow and uneven. In view of this, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) revised its forecast of rainfall for the period (June- September 2012) from 99 per cent of the long period average (LPA) in May 2012 to 96 per cent of LPA in June 2012 and further down to 92 per cent of LPA in July 2012. The latest information (till July 26, 2012) shows that the south-west monsoon has now covered the entire country but the cumulative rainfall is still 21 per cent below the LPA as against 3 per cent below LPA during the corresponding period in the previous year. I.11 Spatially, rainfall across the four main regions of the country is in deficit with the highest deficiency observed in north-west India (38 per cent below LPA). Overall, rainfall has been deficient/scanty across 63 per cent of the total geographical area of the country covering 22 of the 36 sub-divisions and normal/excess across the rest. In contrast, during the corresponding period last year, rainfall was excess/normal across 85 per cent of the geographical area covering 30 sub-divisions. The deficiency in monsoon as gauged from the Reserve Bank\u2019s production-weighted rainfall index (PRN) is higher with the PRN on July 27, 2012 being 76 compared with a reading of 79 for the IMD index (Chart I.6). I.12 The unsatisfactory performance of the south-west monsoon so far in terms of quantum and spatial/temporal distribution resulted in the slow progress in sowing of kharif crops during June 2012. However, there has been significant improvement in sowing during July 2012 for most crops. Notwithstanding this improvement, area sown under pulses and coarse cereals declined sharply (Table I.2). The crop situation is likely to worsen further if El Nino conditions emerge during the later part of the season. Deficit rainfall has also affected the level of water in the 84 reservoirs under the Central Water Commission (CWC). The storage was 24 per cent of capacity on July 26, 2012 as against 43 per cent during the corresponding period last year. (Million hectares) 9.0 -23.0 -14.9 -8.0 1.9 -8.5 -10.1 -11.3 4.5 -27.3 -21.3 3.0 12.8 3.2 0.0 -7.9 Contingency measures are required should monsoon fail I.13 Indian agriculture\u2019s dependence on the monsoon has come down over the years and in recent episodes of deficient monsoons the output impact has been limited. The current level of stock of foodgrains is comfortable should foodgrains output be adversely impacted. At around 80.6 million tonnes in June 2012 (82 million tonnes in May 2012), stocks continue to remain one of the highest ever (Chart I.7). In fact, record stocks necessitate augmentation of storage capacity to avoid wastage of foodgrains. A short-term strategy to protect open stocks is being put in place. The government has also prepared contingency plans in the event of monsoon failure. This entails ensuring sufficient availability of all seeds, fodder, power and diesel, additional wage allocation under MGNREGA and sufficient funds under the National Disaster Relief Fund. An Inter- Ministerial Group has been constituted to review the situation on a weekly basis. On current assessment, rainfall during this year\u2019s monsoon season has been slightly better than that during the drought year of 2009. I.14 Frequent price shocks with respect to high-value food items such as meat, fish, eggs, milk, and fruit and vegetables in the recent period reflect the persistence of supply-demand imbalances. To secure food and nutritional security, apart from increased production of these food items, an increased efficiency in post-harvest handling is essential. The development of vegetable clusters, terminal market complexes, cold chains, and warehouses under the public-private partnership model and operationalising warehouse receipts system are significant steps that hold immense potential for better post-harvest management and price discovery. I.15 To improve efficiency and develop a nation-wide agricultural market, 18 states/union territories have amended their Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts so far. Further reforms such as a single-point market fee system that facilitates the free movement of produce, reduction in price differences between the producer and the consumer market segments and popularising the practice of cleaning, grading, and packaging of the produce are expected to facilitate better market access by farmers, reduce transportation costs and increase the income of farmers. I.16 Growth in the index of industrial production (IIP) moderated sharply to 0.8 per cent during April-May 2012 as compared with 5.7 per cent during April-May 2011 (Table I.3). The slowdown in growth is reflected across all sectors. The mining sector continued to decline mainly due to regulatory and environmental 1.9 3.0 8.2 2.0 0.6 5.2 7.8 83.2 24.6 29.8 66.5 64.8 # : Figures may not add up to 100 due to rounding off. issues affecting coal mining and the low output of natural gas from the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin. I.17 The recent contraction in mining is constraining the growth in the manufacturing sector. Mining output has been contracting since Q2 of 2011-12 impacting manufacturing output adversely, despite increasing imports of industrial inputs such as coal and steel substituting for domestic supply of industrial inputs. An empirical analysis of monthly data from April 2010 onwards reveals that a one per cent increase in mining output, on an average, results in a 0.6 per cent increase in manufacturing output two periods ahead. Robust performance of the domestic mining sector which provides critical industrial inputs such as coal, natural gas and iron ore is, therefore, necessary for sustaining manufacturing growth. Excluding the volatile items, the truncated IIP (96 per cent of IIP) growth in April-May 2012 is 3.0 per cent compared with 0.8 per cent growth in the general IIP (Chart I.9). Also, the growth pattern is skewed, with eight of the 22 industry groups showing negative growth during April-May 2012. I.19 By the use-based classification, moderation in growth is seen in all categories except consumer durables. The output of consumer non-durables has been declining since January 2012. The production of capital goods I.18 There has been a sharp moderation in manufacturing which was affected by sluggish investment activity, waning global demand and high input costs. While the industrial slowdown has been pervasive, it is compounded by the volatility in capital goods output (Chart I.8). declined in April-May 2012. The declining domestic production of capital goods has been partly substituted by increase in capital goods imports. However, domestic production of capital goods has also suffered in the backdrop of weak investment environment. As these conditions persist, investment activity is likely to remain subdued. The modest performance of basic and intermediate goods has also added to the overall moderation in industrial activity. I.20 Revival of global growth is significant for industrial recovery. Domestic industrial growth has a strong correlation with global industrial growth. The correlation coefficient between domestic and global IIP during April 2008 to May 2012 is 0.75 (Chart I.10). Input bottlenecks and capacity constraints impacting core industries I.21 Growth of eight core industries decelerated to 3.4 per cent during April-May 2012 compared to 5.0 per cent during the corresponding period in the previous year. Output of crude oil, natural gas and fertilisers contracted while that of refinery products and electricity decelerated during April-May 2012. Deficit rainfall during the period also affected the generation of hydro power. The output of coal, cement and steel, however, showed improvement during the period (Chart 1.11). I.22 The government has initiated several measures to augment the production potential of core industries, in particular, mining, in the recent period. The improved performance of the coal industry could be partly attributed to this. However, several bottlenecks still afflict the mining sector output and a lot more needs to be done to remove structural constraints that have brought mining activity to a near standstill. I.23 The 17th round of the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (http://www.rbi.org.in/OBICUS17) of the Reserve Bank for Q4 of 2011-12 indicates an improvement in the growth of new orders over the previous quarter, though the y-o-y growth was lower than in Q4 of the previous two years. Capacity utilisation level also improved in Q4 of 2011-12. The improvement is partly on account of seasonality but the level of capacity utilisation in the fourth quarter is fairly close to the peak level observed in the corresponding quarter of the previous year (Chart I.12). As expected, capacity utilisation has a strong co- movement with IIP-manufacturing. all sectors barring IT/BPO and transport witnessing a decline in employment during the quarter. However, the employment of direct workers increased while that of contract workers declined during the quarter. Overall, employment generation in eight major industries during 2011-12 was lower than in the previous year by 14.3 per cent (Table I.4). Employment growth slows down I.24 The quarterly quick survey of employment conducted by the Labour Bureau in select sectors of the economy indicates that employment growth slowed considerably during Q4 of 2011-12 compared to the previous quarter and the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The quarter recorded the lowest rate of employment creation in two years, with Services sector likely to moderate I.25 The slowdown in the industrial sector and the muted demand conditions have impacted the growth of the services sector.

A services sector composite indicator based on growth in indicators of construction, trade and transport, and finance, developed by the Reserve Bank shows continuation of slowdown in services in Q1 of 2012-13 (Chart I.13). The outlook for the services sector depends to a large extent on Growth in 2012-13 likely to be below potential I.26 Going forward, the outlook for growth looks weak and substantially affected by global headwinds, inflation and policy uncertainty. Although the south-west monsoon has been forecasted to be normal during 2012-13, its weak progress so far is a concern. The services sector is also showing signs of slowing down. Growth in communication services is likely to be low. The industrial sector, though improved in May, does not seem to be on course for sustained recovery. With growth slowing down, inflation is expected to moderate but demand- supply imbalances in respect of a number of items are limiting the price adjustment. Rupee depreciation in the recent period, however, is expected to support industrial and services sector activity through improved export competitiveness. Reflecting the slowdown in the domestic economy, growth in aggregate demand weakened further during Q4 of 2011-12. The decline in investment, particularly private corporate investment, has emerged as a major drag on demand. From a long-term perspective, the sustained fall in investment so far has impacted India\u2019s growth potential. Some moderation in private consumption is also taking place, partly due to the impact of inflation on purchasing power. Corporate sales decelerated along with continued decline in profits and could adversely impact investments ahead. In this situation, crowding-in of private investment demand by public investment spending stimulus while aggressively cutting expenditure on subsidies hold the key to growth revival. Expenditure side of GDP continued to show weak demand II.1 The expenditure side aggregates, based on the revised estimates of national income released by the CSO in end-May 2012, are indicative of slackening demand conditions in the economy (Table II.1). This assessment however, is strongly influenced by the \u2018statistical discrepancy\u2019 in the data. For example, the sum of the contribution-weighted growth rates of the different expenditure components in Q4 of 2011-12 works out to 9 per cent, which is much I. GDP at market prices II.

Despite its well-known limitations, expenditure-side GDP data are being used as proxies for components of aggregate demand. However, in view of these limitations, which are amply reflected in the data for Q4 of 2011-12, supplementary information, including anecdotal data and judgements have been used to draw inferences. 1.

Such \u2018statistical discrepancy\u2019 is also reflected in the incorrect manifestation of external demand through positive net exports in Q4 of 2011-12 in contrast to the record current account deficit posted in the data that were released by the Reserve Bank in end-June 2012. II.2 Keeping aside the apparent statistical weaknesses in the data, the moderation in expenditure persisted in Q4 of 2011-12, which was reflected across private and government final consumption expenditure and subdued growth in capital formation. Growth slowdown is reflected in weaker growth in private consumption and investment a significant role. In this context, it may be mentioned that real interest rates in the recent period are lower than their levels in the pre- crisis years when investment rates were much higher. The moderation of investment in the recent period, therefore, suggests that there are factors other than interest rate at play. Empirical estimates in a recent Reserve Bank Working Paper show that the real interest (lending) rates explain only around one-third of real GDP growth. In the post crisis period, the slackening of investment is mainly related to the private corporate sector. In addition, the share of public investment in GDP has declined. Apart from the erosion in corporate profit margins and already high leverage, other domestic and global factors have contributed to weakening investment activity. II.3 The growth in private final consumption expenditure, which accounts for around 60 per cent of GDP, decreased in Q4 of 2011-12. The subdued levels of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), which accounts for around 30 per cent of GDP, can be partly attributed to high interest rates but non-monetary factors have also played Investment outlook remained insipid in Q4 of 2011-12 II.4 Corporate investment intentions remained depressed. The aggregate project cost envisaged from the new projects sanctioned financial assistance by banks/FIs, have continued to moderate through 2011-12 aggregating `2.1 Note: Based on data reported by 39 banks/FIs. trillion in 2011-12, down from `3.9 trillion in the previous year (Table II.3). Industry-wise analysis revealed that the share of the power sector in the total envisaged project cost remained the highest in Q4 of 2011-12 followed by metal & metal products and textiles (Chart II.1). II.5 The time-phasing details of projects that have been sanctioned institutional assistance for various years up to 2011-12 indicate that total intended capital expenditure by private corporate (non-financial) firms declined in 2011-12 and can be expected to decline further during 2012-13 as planned investment in new projects is likely to remain low (Table II.4). Overall, declining trend in investment demand from the private corporate sector has emerged as the major drag on overall investment. Moderation in sales growth coupled with high input cost pressures led to declining corporate profits II.6 Sales growth for select Non-Government, Non-Financial (NGNF) listed companies by and large held up during 2011-12, though there was a perceptible drop in the last quarter (Table II.5, II.6). However, persistent pressure from input costs and rising interest outgo, led to decline in net profits (PAT). Operating and net profit margins declined during 2011-12 indicating a weakening pricing power for Indian corporates. 46 111 584 443 1,184 #: The estimates are ex ante, incorporating only the envisaged investment, and thus are different from those actually realised/ utilised. : Other income excludes extraordinary income/expenditure if reported explicitly. #: For companies reporting this item explicitly.

This decline points towards a pessimistic corporate outlook for demand conditions ahead. High deficits limit fiscal space for reviving private investment II.9 The centre\u2019s gross fiscal deficit (GFD) rose sharply to 5.8 per cent in 2011-12 from 4.9 per cent in 2010-11, with revenue deficit constituting over three-fourths of GFD as against 67.5 per cent a year ago. The widening of revenue deficit in 2011-12 reflected the impact of the economic slowdown on tax revenues with the revenue receipts-GDP ratio in 2011-12 turning out to be lower than even the crisis years of 2008-09 and 2009-10. Although the revenue expenditure-GDP ratio declined in 2011-12, this was at the cost of development revenue expenditure. Notably, subsidies increased to 2.5 per cent of GDP. With the large and growing revenue deficit constraining the fiscal space for investment expenditure, the capital outlay to GDP ratio declined to 1.6 per cent, well below the pre- crisis level of over 2 per cent. II.10 Preliminary data indicates that the combined revenue and fiscal deficits of the centre and states as a proportion of GDP increased by 1.2 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points, respectively, in 2011-12 over the previous year, with over 80 per cent of the increase contributed by the centre (Table II.7). Combined development expenditure-GDP ratio increased in 2011-12 on account of the states (Table II.8). Per cent to GDP 1. Total expenditure 2. Revenue Expenditure 3.

Likely overshooting of subsidies pose fiscal risks during 2012-13 State finances budgeted to improve further in 2012-13 II.11 Achieving fiscal consolidation as envisaged in the budget for 2012-13 would hinge on the realisation of budgeted tax buoyancies and capping of subsidies to below 2 per cent of GDP. The compensation to oil marketing companies for under-recoveries budgeted at `400 billion for 2012-13, however, appears inadequate, given the spillover in compensation of `385 billion in Q4 of 2011-12 and under-recoveries of `478 billion reported by oil marketing companies for Q1 of 2012-13, in spite of some softening of global crude oil prices. Capping the subsidies within the budgeted limits would necessitate steps to allow the pass-through of international crude oil prices to domestic prices, failing which it would be difficult to achieve the overall deficit targets. II.15 In contrast to the centre, the consolidated revenue account of the states (excluding Mizoram and Manipur) showed a marginal surplus in 2011-12 as compared with the revenue balance in 2010-11. Although there was an increase in the GFD-GDP ratio, this was used to fund higher capital outlays. On the revenue front, despite the economic slowdown, the tax- GDP ratio of the states increased over the previous year, aided in large part by higher VAT/ sales tax collections on petroleum products. In fact, for the first time tax collections of state governments on petroleum products in 2011-12 were higher than those of the centre. The quality of expenditure also improved in 2011-12, with increases in development and social sector expenditures as well as capital outlay in proportion to GDP. II.12 Besides the fiscal slippage on account of fuel subsidies, moderation in growth from the assumed 7.6 per cent for 2011-12 in the Union budget could be another risk factor for revenue receipts. II.13 Available data show that during April- May 2012 key deficits in terms of percentages to budget estimates improved over the corresponding period of the previous year mainly on account of higher tax revenue, particularly under income and services tax collections. Direct taxes continued to exhibit buoyant growth in Q1 of 2012-13, although the increase partly reflects the lower tax refunds compared with the previous year. Indirect tax collections under Union excise and customs duties during Q1 of 2012-13 shows marked slippage from budgeted growth. II.16 The key deficit indicators of the states are budgeted to improve further in 2012-13. The consolidated revenue surplus of the state governments is budgeted to increase in 2012-13, mainly on account of an increase in the revenue receipts-GDP ratio, which is to be supplemented by reduction in the revenue expenditure-GDP ratio. The budgeted increase in revenue surplus would enable a higher capital outlay-GDP ratio for the states in 2012-13, even while reducing their consolidated GFD-GDP ratio. II.17 The majority of the states have budgeted to meet the targets set by the Thirteenth Finance Commission (ThFC) for deficit/debt indicating their commitment to the fiscal consolidation process. The challenge for the states is to refrain from sacrificing the quality of fiscal adjustment in their endeavour to meet the incentivised quantitative targets. II.14 Aggregate expenditure growth in the first two months of 2012-13 was higher than a year ago, attributable to higher non-plan revenue expenditure, with interest payments accounting for over 29 per cent of the increase. Need to create fiscal space, spur investment to revive growth II.18 Recovery of investment is critical in reviving growth but depends on fiscal consolidation and improvement in overall macroeconomic scenario. The major challenges to growth recovery at the current juncture emanate from the weak investment demand. Even a modest recovery in economic growth during 2012-13 is contingent on the recovery of investment. However, the capacity of investment to respond to monetary policy actions to stimulate growth is conditional on an improvement in non-monetary factors that have impacted investment in the current cycle. On the other hand, persistent inflation, limits the space for monetary policy to revive growth. II.19 The slowdown in consumption demand also points towards the impact of high and persistent inflation on purchasing power. This also indicates the need for keeping inflation under check to maintain consumption demand at levels consistent with the overall growth objective. Therefore, monetary policy has to continue to remain guarded against a build-up of inflationary risks as well as to sustain the growth potential. II.20 Given the deterioration in the fiscal situation, the option of using fiscal policy to stimulate aggregate demand remains unavailable unlike in 2008-09 when the previous period of fiscal consolidation helped to provide the necessary fiscal space. As higher deficits could lead to pressures on yields, affecting the already weak private investment demand, it is critical to return to a credible and durable fiscal consolidation path. As such, fiscal space would need to be created by controlling revenue expenditure to provide more resources for capital expenditure which could crowd-in private investment. The weakness in the external sector observed in 2011-12 continued during the \ufb01 rst quarter of 2012-13, mainly re\ufb02 ecting uncertainty in global economic and \ufb01 nancial conditions coupled with weak domestic macroeconomic conditions. The rupee witnessed renewed pressures and depreciated against the US dollar in Q1 of 2012-13, in line with the trend registered by major EDE currencies. Capital \ufb02 ows have remained subdued and volatile. Notwithstanding various policy measures initiated by the Reserve Bank, signi\ufb01 cant depreciation of the rupee, softening commodity prices and moderation in gold imports, improvement in the trade de\ufb01 cit will continue to hinge upon global macroeconomic conditions and therefore, upside risks remain. With services exports likely to decelerate during 2012-13, the risks of CAD going above its sustainable rate, and dif\ufb01 culties in \ufb01 nancing it, persist. Global factors continue to weigh on India\u2019s exports III.1 India\u2019s merchandise exports, which had decelerated in 2011-12, contracted in Q1 of 2012-13 mainly re\ufb02 ecting subdued demand conditions in key global markets, particularly the EU and the US (Table III.1). In particular, exports of engineering goods, petroleum products, gems and jewellery and readymade garments have been affected. Evidently the signi\ufb01 cant depreciation in the rupee since H2 of 2011-12 could not suf\ufb01 ciently offset the impact of the slowdown in global demand. In recent years, due to export diversification efforts, the share of developing economies in India\u2019s total exports witnessed a gradual increase. However, as the sluggish economic conditions in advanced economies (AEs) slowly spilled over to other emerging and developing economies (EDEs), diversi\ufb01 cation did not yield results similar to those seen in previous years. Going forward, economic conditions especially in EU are likely to remain muted for some time. As a result, growth in global trade volume, including exports from EDEs, is likely to be lower in 2012. Indian exports are likely to re\ufb02 ect this general trend. Softening of prices narrowed the trade deficit in India\u2019s external III.2 position in 2011-12 stemmed partly from the import-induced surge in the current account deficit (CAD). Given the inelastic nature of India\u2019s imports of petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) and gold, the rise in international prices of these commodities led to overall high imports. This trend, however, reversed in Q1 of 2012-13. The decline in imports in the quarter was sharper than that in exports (Chart III.1a). Import moderation was mainly on account of a modest contraction in POL imports and a significant contraction in gold and silver imports. The lower growth in POL reflects the softening of international crude oil prices, while the decline in gold and silver imports appears to reflect the impact of policy measures taken in January and March 2012 (Chart III.1b). Growth moderation in non-oil imports in recent months appears to be on account of confluence of various factors, viz., domestic slowdown, global uncertainty, moderation in global commodity prices and the possible impact of rupee depreciation in some sectors. As a result, the trade deficit narrowed somewhat in Q1 of 2012-13 compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. Upside risks to trade deficit persist possibility that CAD could improve in 2012-13. However, current assessment suggests that such improvement could be insufficient to ensure CAD sustainability. The upside risk to CAD remain significant. The response of exports to depreciation of rupee has so far remained muted due to subdued global demand. Downside risks to export growth are large in view of worsening global conditions. Exchange rate sensitivity of India\u2019s import is also limited. Slowdown in global IT spending may dampen growth in software exports III.4 Despite the challenges in global market conditions, services exports, in general and software exports in particular sustained the growth momentum in 2011-12 (Table III.2). However, net services exports earnings at US$14 billion in Q1 of 2012-13, have declined by about 12 per cent y-o-y, suggesting loss of momentum. Services exports in gross terms expanded by 3 per cent, while imports increased by 19 per cent in this quarter. Going forward, NASSCOM projection of 11-14 per cent growth in software exports in 2012-13, suggests deceleration. Current indications, borne out by dollar revenue guidance of IT majors, suggest that software export earnings may even be lower than projected by NASSCOM. The risk of lower software exports may arise from technology by US reduced spending on corporations, continued uncertainty in the euro area countries and likely euro depreciation.

Capital \ufb02 ows may remain volatile due to global uncertainties III.5 The exacerbation in CAD during 2011- 12 led to depletion of reserves notwithstanding improved capital \ufb02 ows (Table III.3). Since Q1 of 2012-13, concerns about the growth and \ufb01 nancial health of euro area countries have further intensified. In addition, signs of weakness in the US and China have also made investors more cautious and driven up global financial market volatility. These factors, combined with weakening domestic macroeconomic conditions, led to a net FII out\ufb02 ow of US$ 1.7 billion in Q1 of 2012-13. Concerns about the domestic business environment appear to be weighing on FDI in\ufb02 ows as well. NRI deposits, however, have picked up in recent months (Table III.4). Since concerns about the growth outlook for AEs seem to have prompted investors to reconsider the resilience of emerging market growth as well, the outlook for capital \ufb02 ows to EDEs including India remains subdued. Rupee gains in Q4 of 2011-12 dissipated in Q1 of 2012-13 The rupee gained by 4.1 per cent in Q4 III.6 of 2011-12, partly re\ufb02 ecting the favourable impact of policy measures by the Reserve Bank to improve capital \ufb02 ows and curb speculative pressure in foreign exchange market.

As a result, the rupee reached a low of 57.2 on June 27, 2012 and the real effective exchange rate (i.e., the REER based on 6, 30 and 36 currency baskets) recorded a depreciation (Table III.5).

India\u2019s Net International Investment Position (NIIP) also weakened (Table III.8). Rising vulnerability to external shocks III.9 The CAD-GDP ratio was high at 4.5 per cent in Q4 of 2011-12, taking the full year 203.6 -216.5 -196.6 -204.8 244.8 ratio to an all time high of 4.2 per cent. Such high level of CAD, especially against the backdrop of volatile global macroeconomic conditions and volatile capital \ufb02 ows, raise grave concerns about its sustainability. A recent analysis shows that with GDP growth of 7 per cent, CAD-GDP ratio of around 2.5 per cent is sustainable. The estimate is based on analysis of threshold level of India\u2019s net external liability to GDP ratio to work out sustainable CAD-GDP ratio in various growth scenarios. With an increase in de\ufb01 cit beyond this level, \ufb01 nancing could be a constraint and the external sector vulnerability may rise further. High external debt, along with a deterioration in the net international investment position and a moderate decline in forex reserves also weakened the resilience of India\u2019s external sector in Q4 of 2011-12. Going forward, the trend in CAD will largely depend on the global macroeconomic and trade environment. The trend in capital \ufb02 ows will depend on global liquidity conditions, as well as the domestic investment and policy environment. PR: Partially Revised P: Preliminary. * Based on annualised GDP. While continuing to manage the growth-inflation trade-off, the Reserve Bank reduced the repo rate by 50 basis points in April 2012. Monetary conditions have gradually eased in 2012-13 so far as a result of the two-stage reduction in the cash reserve ratio in Q4 of 2011-12, the repo rate cut and significant depreciation of the exchange rate. Active liquidity management by the Reserve Bank by way of sizeable open market purchases and other policy measures has helped correct the excessively tight liquidity that prevailed during the latter part of 2011-12. Besides the gradual pick-up in growth in monetary aggregates in 2012-13 so far, there has been a pick-up in non-food credit which as of mid-July 2012 was growing marginally above the indicative projection for 2012-13. Reserve Bank front-loads rate cut using the available monetary policy space IV.1 In April 2012, the Reserve Bank reduced the repo rate for the first time in three years. Even as inflation remained the main concern, the policy rate was reduced by 50 basis points on account of moderation in growth below its post-crisis trend (Table IV.1). While it was recognised that the deviation in growth from its trend was modest, the slowdown, nevertheless, was expected to contribute to some moderation in core inflation. The cumulative impact of past monetary tightening was expected to moderate inflation further through slower growth. Inflation has, however, persisted above IV.2 the level consistent with sustainable growth. When the Reserve Bank undertook the front- loaded rate cut action in April 2012, it clearly enunciated that upside risks to inflation persisted and space for further reduction in policy rates was limited. This space was further constrained by lack of credible action to curtail subsidies and related expenditure by the government. Also, there were a number of factors other than monetary policy actions behind the growth slowdown in 2011-12. IV.3 Apart from the rate cut, monetary conditions eased as a result of softening impact on interest rates of the 125 basis points reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) during Q4 of 2011-12 and the significant exchange rate depreciation (about 10 per cent in Q1 of 2012- 13 and about 20 per cent cumulative since August 2011). The monetary easing during Q1 of 2012-13 has significantly corrected the tightness in monetary and liquidity conditions witnessed during Q4 of 2011-12. M3 expansion during 2011-12 at 13.1 per cent was below the indicative projection of 15.5 per cent. Low reserve money expansion at 9.6 per cent (adjusted for CRR changes) contributed to lower expansion of money supply. Reserve money creation has improved during 2012-13 so far, and deposit creation and consequently, monetary expansion is within sight of indicative projections for the year (Table IV.2).

Liquidity deficit eases in response to active management and measures taken by the Reserve Bank IV.4 There was a significant easing of liquidity deficit in Q1 of 2012-13, and the extent of deficit returned to the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level of one per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in July 2012 (Chart IV.1). This was primarily on account of large scale open market purchases by the Reserve Bank as also measures such as enhancing of the limit of export credit refinance (ECR). IV.5 There was a distinct period of liquidity tightness that prevailed from November 2011 to early April 2012. The liquidity squeeze started in November 2011 on account of large scale forex intervention by the Reserve Bank as well as the usual high currency demand during the festive season. The squeeze on liquidity persisted into Q4 of 2011-12 as the government built up large balances with the Reserve Bank. There was continued intervention in the forex market while the drain on account of currency persisted due to seasonal factors as well as elections in a few states (Chart IV.2). Moreover, the spread between the pace of credit growth and deposit growth, which had narrowed in the first three quarters of 2011-12 and had in fact turned negative in December 2011, widened again during the fourth quarter. This added a structural dimension to the liquidity deficit (Chart IV.3). The Reserve Bank responded by injecting liquidity through outright open market operations of `1.3 trillion between November 2011 and March 2012 as also CRR cuts that released about `0.8 trillion into the system. Despite the active management, the liquidity deficit persisted at a high level. helped in steering the monetary policy operating target, the weighted average overnight call money rate, within the formal corridor (Chart IV.4). The movements in the operating target of monetary policy mostly mirror the liquidity position in the system. As noted above, there was a systemic liquidity deficit from November 2011 to early April 2012. This period coincided with the call rate mainly staying above the mid-point of the corridor (i.e., the repo rate) and at times hovering close to the ceiling set by the MSF rate. As liquidity eased in Q1 of 2012-13, the call rate gradually eased back to the mid-point of the corridor. IV.6 Since April 2012, however, there has been an easing of the liquidity stress in the system. The significant easing was brought about by the Reserve Bank actively managing liquidity through the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) and open market operations (OMO). The Reserve Bank injected liquidity through outright OMO purchases of `0.8 trillion in the financial year so far, of which `0.6 trillion was through auction route. Also, there was some narrowing of the wedge between the pace of growth of deposit and credit in Q1 of 2012-13. To further augment liquidity and IV.8 encourage banks to increase credit flow to the export sector, the Reserve Bank increased the limit of ECR from 15 per cent of outstanding export credit to 50 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning June 30, 2012. This amounted to release of additional liquidity support of over `300 billion, equivalent to about 50 basis points reduction in the CRR. The daily average amount of ECR availed increased from `70 billion in June 2012 to `177 billion in July 2012 (up to July 26) . In order to provide greater liquidity IV.7 cushion to banks, the borrowing limit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) under the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) has been raised from one per cent of their NDTL to two per cent since April 17, 2012. This has further IV.9 As regards the autonomous factors that drive liquidity \u2013 currency with the public, intervention in the foreign exchange market and government\u2019s cash position \u2013 the first two were largely adverse during the Q1 of 2012-13. There is typically strong demand for currency in April and May coinciding with the rabi marketing season. Also, as there was extreme volatility in the exchange rate, the Reserve Bank sold foreign exchange to authorised dealers in May and June. However, as a large part of the intervention was also in the forward/swap market, drain on rupee liquidity was not very significant. The liquidity stress from the above two autonomous factors was partly addressed by the net drawdown of balances by the government. As noted earlier, the large build-up in the government balance with the Reserve Bank in Q4 of 2011-12 had compounded the liquidity deficit in that quarter. As government spending increased significantly in the first quarter of 2012-13, there was concomitant easing of liquidity. The net effect of government spending during the quarter (June 30, 2012 over March 31, 2012) was release of `549 billion into the system. of monetary aggregates in 2012-13 so far as against the steady deceleration observed in the fourth quarter of 2011-12 (Chart IV.6). On a y-o-y basis, the growth rate as on July 13, 2012 was lower than the previous year. Reserve money expansion improves in Q1 of 2012-13 IV.12 There was a pick-up in demand for currency during the first quarter of 2012-13 as is usually observed in Q1. The y-o-y growth rate was lower than that of the previous year on account of the base effect (Chart IV.7). IV.10 There was a sharp deceleration in the pace of expansion of reserve money during Q4 of 2011-12. While this was predominantly on account of the CRR cuts, even adjusting for the first-round impact of CRR cut, the adjusted reserve money growth showed a deceleration. As seen earlier, active management of liquidity through OMO, LAF and MSF transactions led to a gradual rise in the rate of reserve money expansion in Q1 of 2012-13 as against the steady deceleration observed in the previous quarters (Chart IV.5). On the liabilities side of the Reserve Bank balance sheet, the growth is explained by the increased demand for currency. IV.13 The mobilisation of deposits during the first quarter of 2012-13 was higher than in comparable period of recent years. The y-o-y deposit growth of SCBs at 14.7 per cent on July 13, 2012 is below the indicative projection of 16 per cent for 2012-13 (Chart IV.8). The Deceleration in broad money growth arrested in Q1 of 2012-13 IV.11 Given the significant primary liquidity injection through OMO purchases and CRR cuts, there has been a pick-up in growth rates increase in deposit across the bank groups has, however, been skewed (Table IV.3). Monetary expansion improves with rise in money multiplier IV.14 With the CRR cuts effected in January 2012 and March 2012, there has been a reduction in the ratio of bankers\u2019 deposits with the Reserve Bank to aggregate deposits in the banking system (the reserves deposit ratio). However, monetary expansion remained subdued during Q4 of 2011-12 as increase in money multiplier was not commensurate to the CRR cut as currency demand was high. The relatively higher pace of deposit mobilisation in 2012-13 so far has resulted in lowering both the behavioural ratios. Thus, with the rise in the 1.

Within industries, nearly two-thirds of the credit flow was to mining and quarrying, rubber, plastic and their products, beverage and tobacco, vehicle, vehicle parts and transport equipment and wood and wood products. money multiplier, there has been a gradual pick- up in money supply in 2012-13 so far (Chart IV.9). IV.15 The y-o-y growth rate in non-food credit increased to 17.4 per cent in mid-July 2012 from 16.8 per cent at end-March 2012 (Chart IV.10). Hence, credit growth is in line with the indicative trajectory of 17 per cent for the year. Anecdotal evidence from bankers suggests that there may be some deceleration ahead. IV.16 Analysis of the sectoral deployment of credit (based on data from select banks which cover 95 per cent of total non-food credit IV.17 There has been a 41 per cent increase in the total flow of financial resources to the commercial sector during 2012-13 so far, compared to the corresponding period of previous year (data on banks is available till July 13, 2012 while that for most non-bank sources is for up to June only). Unlike the previous year, banks as well as non-banks had a near equal contribution to funding in the economy during the period (Table IV.4). There was about two-fold increase in funding from non-bank domestic sources. The marked increase was on account of higher issuances of commercial papers (CPs), accommodation from all Indian financial institutions (AIFIs), net credit by housing finance companies and LIC\u2019s net investment. Foreign sources of funding, however, declined compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. This is consistent with the slowdown in capital flows during the year so far. Monetary and liquidity conditions are not significantly impinging on growth IV.18 While there has been some rise in nominal and real interest rates during 2011-12, computation of real weighted average lending rates (WALR) suggest that they are currently much lower than the pre-crisis period of 2003-04 to 2007-08 when the investment boom took place. In nominal terms, the WALR averaged 12.4 per cent in the pre-crisis period, 1. Public issues by non-financial entities 2. Gross private placements by non-financial entities 3.

After marginal hardening for two years, the nominal rate stood at 12.7 per cent for 2011-12. The real WALR calculated as nominal rate less WPI inflation fell from an average of 7.0 per cent in the pre-crisis period to 4.0 per cent in the post- crisis period, and was as low as 3.8 per cent in 2011-12 (Table IV.5). The fall is less sharp if GDP deflator is used to calculate inflation instead of WPI. IV.19 A negative relationship between real output growth and real interest rates does exist, and as such real interest rate matters for growth and investment. In spite of the rate hikes, real interest rates are lower than in the pre-crisis period. In this context, there is a need to look at non-monetary factors that are constraining growth as current monetary and liquidity WALR: Weighted average nominal lending rate, estimated based on Basic Statistical Returns of Scheduled Commercial Banks. * Average of the years 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07 ^ WALR for 2011-12 is based on data for 21,452 branches of conditions are not impinging upon growth significantly. Global financial conditions deteriorated further during Q1 of 2012-13 as Greece and Spain came near flashpoint, requiring further bailouts to contain the contagion. The LIBOR-fixing case further demonstrated the fragilities in the banking and financial market space. Subdued global growth is increasing spillover risks, even as fresh rounds of austerity measures have been put in place to tackle the sovereign debt crisis. The financial markets in India also remained under pressure with increased volatility in the currency and equity markets, in line with the other emerging economies. The Reserve Bank undertook a slew of measures to boost capital flows and also to ensure adequate liquidity in the domestic money markets.

Headline inflation persisted above 7 per cent during Q1 of 2012-13 due to a rebound in food inflation as well as high fuel inflation even as non-food manufactured products inflation declined to below 5 per cent. The softening impact of growth moderation on inflation was partly offset by structural rigidities in the supply of food as well as the exchange rate depreciation. The benefits from the decline in global commodity prices were also partly offset by the falling rupee. The near-term inflation trajectory could remain sticky and conditioned by a number of risks that emanate from the unsatisfactory progress and distribution of the south-west monsoon, higher MSPs announced for kharif crops and the impact of the exchange rate pass-through. The path of inflation could also be impacted by the timing and magnitude of administered price revisions even though such adjustments have become necessary to reduce pressure on the medium-term inflation from expansionary fiscal policy. Continued pressure from wages and the structural nature of protein-food inflation could also keep inflation high even with moderation in overall growth. Added monetary easing by major economies as falling inflation provides space VI.1 Continuing uncertainty about how the sovereign debt crisis might play out along with newer indications of weakening growth, both in Advanced Economies (AEs) as well as Emerging and Developing Economies (EDEs) resulted in a decline in global commodity prices and moderation of global inflation. Demand pressures in the AEs are likely to remain muted for an extended period of time due to negative output gaps and subdued wages in the face of continued high unemployment in most economies. Inflation is also edging lower in most EDEs, largely helped by lower international primary commodity prices, given the higher share of primary commodities in their overall consumption. However, the ultimate impact of falling commodity prices on the EDEs is also conditioned by the exchange rate movements of their currencies. Volatility in commodity prices and exchange rate movements are likely to impart greater volatility in inflation for EDEs as compared with AEs. VI.2 In view of the amplified risks to growth and weakening inflationary pressures, many central banks undertook further monetary policy easing, although most of them remained wary of additional quantitative easing. The US Fed decided to extend \u201cOperation Twist\u201d till December 2012. The European Central Bank in June 2012 broadened the collateral acceptable at its window and in July 2012 reduced its policy rate. However, the Bank of England decided to increase its quantitative easing asset purchase programme. The People\u2019s Bank of China reduced the reserve requirements ratio in May 2012 and further cut its policy rate in June and July 2012. CPI inflation in all these countries has fallen and is currently below 3 per cent, thus providing monetary space to address growth risks (Table VI.1). Global commodity prices declined on amplified risks to global growth and improved supply prospects VI.3 International prices of most commodities weakened during Q1 of 2011-12 due to growing economic uncertainties and weakening growth (Chart VI.1). Though the benefit from lower global commodity prices to India was partly offset by the depreciation of the rupee, as in the case of many EDEs, overall it has had a softening impact on global inflation. Global crude oil prices moderated on sovereign debt fears and the continued rise in production and build-up of inventories.

Compared with the average price of US$ 111.9 per barrel during 2011-12, the average Indian basket crude oil prices moderated to US$ 106.9 per barrel during Q1 of 2012-13. Prices declined to US$92 per barrel during the second fortnight of June 2012 before recovering to US$102.3 per barrel as on July 26, 2012. The recent increase has been both on account of aggravated geo-political tensions and monetary policy stimulus to revive growth by a number of central banks. VI.4 Metal prices declined on concerns about moderation in global demand with the focus on Europe and China. Global food prices also moderated in recent months as is evident from the decline of the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) food price index by about 7 per cent during Q1 of 2012-13. However, drought in the US and unfavourable weather conditions in Europe and other major crop producing countries are likely to impact food production negatively during 2012-13, which could put upward pressure on global food prices. Moreover, global commodity prices could come under further pressure if demand in the EDEs recover or excess global liquidity spills over to the commodity markets. Inflation pressures persist in India despite weakening of growth momentum VI.5 Headline wholesale price index (WPI) inflation declined from a high of 10 per cent in September 2011 to 7.2 per cent in January 2012. During Q1 of 2012-13, the average headline inflation was at 7.4 per cent (7.3 per cent, provisional, for June 2012) (Chart VI.2). The current headline inflation, though lower than the average inflation of above 9 per cent during the past two years, is much higher than the decadal average of 5.4 per cent during the 2000s. The WPI increased on a sustained basis and the 3-month moving average seasonally adjusted month-over-month changes since January 2012 indicate sustained price pressures with some moderation in April-May 2012 (Chart VI.2 d). In terms of contribution to overall VI.6 inflation, the share of food picked up sharply from February 2012. However, the contribution of manufactured non-food products recorded a consistent decline which was largely on account of deceleration in growth momentum in Q4 of meat continued to be in the double digits since August 2011, reflecting both structural demand-supply imbalances and input cost pressures (Chart VI.4). While the volatility in food inflation was largely on account of the seasonal movements in the prices of vegetables, the sustained increase in the prices of protein- rich items imparted a structural character to food inflation. Uncertainty over monsoon and high MSP could put further pressure on food inflation 2011-12. The contribution of the fuel group remained high (Chart VI.3). VI.7 Food inflation increased significantly in recent months, driven largely by the increase in vegetable prices following the seasonal decline. Apart from vegetables, inflation was also high in pulses and edible oils in recent months. Advance estimates of production show shortfalls in the production of pulses as well as oilseeds during 2011-12. While cereals inflation remained moderate in the recent past (3.6 per cent on average during October 2010-March 2012), it increased to 6.4 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13 despite record foodgrains production in the previous year. Also, inflation in protein-rich items like milk, eggs, fish and VI.8 There could be a further build-up of food inflationary pressures during 2012-13. The slow progress of the south-west monsoon so far and the uncertainty about its quantum as well as spatial and temporal distribution has emerged as a major risk to food inflation in the near-term. For the marketing year 2012-13, the government has announced increase in the minimum support price (MSP) for various crops in the range of 15 to 53 per cent. The commodities for which MSP has been raised have a combined weight of 3.4 per cent in overall WPI and the average increase (using WPI weights) work out to 25.6 per cent. The impact of MSP on market prices could vary across different commodities. However, the price pressures from the MSP continue to remain a major risk to inflation as the increases in MSP tend to translate into increases in market prices for most commodities. 17.2 10.1* -8.0 Indicates the depreciation of the rupee against dollar.

Note: The composition of Indian Basket of Crude Oil represents average of Oman & Dubai for sour grades and Brent (Dated) for sweet grade in the ratio of 67.6:32.4. High fuel inflation continued as rupee depreciation partly offset lower crude prices Fuel inflation remained in double VI.9 digits, reflecting the increase in international crude oil prices over the past two years. Though global crude oil prices have declined since March 2012, lagged pass-through of past increases has led to further increase in fuel prices. The Oil Marketing Companies (OMC) raised petrol prices by `7.5 per litre on May 24, 2012 and subsequently adjusted the prices in line with changes in international prices. Also, the OMCs decided to implement the revised structure of \u2018state specific cost\u2019 with effect from July 24/25, 2012 to adjust for irrecoverable state taxes. This has led to changes in prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG across different states. While prices increased in some states, it declined in some other states reflecting the state specific tax structure. Since March 2012, the extent of crude oil prices decline in dollar terms has been substantial enough to reduce the price in Indian rupee terms despite depreciation of the rupee (Table VI.2). However, administered prices have not been revised for more than a year and therefore, risks to fuel inflation continue to remain significant (Chart VI.5). administered prices in line with trends in international prices will further expand under- recoveries, which will lead to considerable fiscal strain. Though price adjustments will exert inflationary pressures in the near term, the risk to medium-term price stability from a widening fiscal deficit will be addressed by adjustment of prices in line with market conditions VI.10 Currently, the estimated under-recovery by domestic OMCs for diesel is `9.95 per litre, for PDS kerosene `27.20 per litre and `319.00 per cylinder for domestic LPG. Not adjusting Inflation in non-food manufactured products muted by decline in growth VI.12 Manufactured non-food products inflation, an indicator of generalised inflationary pressures, moderated to below 5 per cent by March 2012 after two years. Since then, manufactured non-food products inflation remained subdued (4.8 per cent, provisional, June 2012), though price pressures are still visible in some manufactured commodities such as metals, fertilisers, pesticides and paints. Even though non-food manufactured products inflation declined in recent months, it still remains higher than the decadal average of 4.0 per cent during the 2000s. Also, core inflation in India in the recent period has been much higher than in AEs and EDEs. VI.13 The month-over-month seasonally adjusted annualised changes (3-month moving average) showed moderation of price pressures, notwithstanding a marginal pick-up in the latest month (Chart VI.6). Within non-food manufactured products, the \u2018basic metals and metals products\u2019 group, which has a substantial weight (10.7 per cent) in overall WPI, continued to have double digit inflation. Domestic metal prices have largely been following the global trends and therefore, the inflation in this category remained high as exchange rate depreciation partly offset the impact of moderating global prices (Chart VI.7). Apart from the pressure from global price trends and exchange rate movements, domestic constraints on supplies of key inputs like minerals and coal could also be a source of pressure on prices. These trends also indicate that the supply-side pressures do translate to generalised inflation through the input cost channel. These partly explain the lower than expected pace of moderation in non-food manufactured products inflation in the wake of significant slowdown in growth. Input cost pressures continued to VI.14 remain persistent as seen from the HSBC Markit Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) which indicates that the pace of expansion of input costs was much higher than increases in output prices (Chart VI.8). In an environment of significant decline in profit margins (see Chapter II for details) this could force manufacturers to pass on prices even when demand remains moderate. This is corroborated by the output price index in PMI picking up significantly in recent months. Wage pressures remain significant and may constrain the moderation in core inflation VI.15 The persistence of inflation can also partly be attributed to labour market conditions. The increase in wages in rural areas continued to be much sharper than compared to the comparable rate of inflation (Chart VI.9). The divergent pattern of this relationship between wage growth and inflation across major states also points out to region specific factors that influenced the wage-price dynamics (Chart VI.10). Similarly, in the formal sector, analysis of company finance data suggests that growth in staff costs, despite a moderate decline in the recent period, remained elevated (Chart VI.11). Rising real wages during the period of high inflation do protect the working population from the adverse impacts of inflation. However, rising real wages in excess of the productivity growth may not be sustainable in the medium-term and run the risk of a wage-price spiral. Inflation as per the newly introduced VI.16 Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained significantly higher than the WPI inflation (Table VI.3). There was also substantial divergence in inflation in certain product groups such as condiments and spices and vegetables. Notably, the divergence in the new CPI and the WPI inflation after excluding the volatile items (food and fuel) continued to be high. A comparison of similar items under the WPI and the new CPI indicate that there is divergence even among common product group inflation (Chart VI.12). This divergence between the new CPI inflation and the headline WPI inflation has raised concerns about the extent of the transmission of recent moderation in headline inflation to the consumers. Risks to inflation remain even as growth slowdown eases demand pressures VI.17 The difference in weighting pattern and coverage could also explain the divergence between inflation based on the CPI and the WPI. While food has a relatively larger weight in the new CPI, the WPI has more weight for manufactured products with items like metals and chemicals that do not enter the CPI directly. The new CPI includes housing and many services which are not covered under WPI. Comparable data for a relatively longer period of time is necessary to make a realistic assessment of the divergence between the new CPI and existing inflation measures. The new comprehensive CPI does not have adequate history to support data analysis and to be used as the sole headline measure of inflation. VI.18 Even though inflation declined during the latter part of 2011-12, the persistence of inflation in recent months above the 7 per cent mark points to the sticky nature of inflation, even as growth has slowed. Inflation in the non-food manufactured products category came down to below 5 per cent, partly reflecting the demand moderating impact of past monetary tightening and weakening of pricing power. However, high food inflation, especially in protein-rich items, and persistent fuel inflation kept headline inflation high. The near-term inflation outlook is conditioned on the spatial and temporal distribution of the south-west monsoon, the impact of exchange rate pass-through and likely trends in global commodity prices. While moderation in global commodity prices could ease the pressure from imported inflation, pass-through of rupee depreciation will partly offset the impact. The increases in MSP and sustained increases in wage levels could further exert pressure on overall inflation. The administered prices of fuel do not reflect the trends in global market prices and revision of these would be necessary to reduce the extent of suppressed inflation. The persistence of inflation in an environment of slowing growth is a major challenge for monetary policy. The outlook for the Indian economy remains weak. In an uncertain global economic environment, the interplay between growth slowdown, high inflation, wide current account, fiscal gaps and falling investment has weakened the economy. Surveys of business expectations confirm that confidence levels are low. On the other hand, inflation expectations remain sticky. The economy has reached a critical point, at which economic activity can spin up or down depending on how the policy uncertainty is addressed and supporting measures put in place. Leading indicators, especially credit growth and PMIs, suggest that a recovery is still possible with appropriate policy action. VII.1\t The\tIndian\teconomy\tslowed\tsignificantly\t during 2011-12, with growth decelerating to 6.5 per cent. The growth prospects for 2012-13 remain weak due to a combination of global and domestic macro-economic factors. Global growth is turning weaker than anticipated. Along with the sovereign debt overhang and financial\tmarket\tuncertainties,\tit\tis\timpacting\t global trade. VII.2 The IMF in its July update of the World Economic Outlook has made significant downward revisions in its current year growth estimates for India, UK, Brazil and China. As fiscal adjustments take shape in advanced economies\t(AEs),\tshrinking\tdeficits\tcould\tkeep\t AEs growth slow for an extended period. This could\tresult\tin\ta\tsignificant\tdrag\ton\tgrowth\tin\t India. VII.3 Recent indications suggest that global trade\tflows\thave\tebbed\tagain\tafter\tsome\tpick-up\t in Q4 of 2011-12. This trend could persist because of tight credit conditions, the adverse impact\tof\tdeleveraging\ton\ttrade\tfinance\tand,\t more importantly, growth slowdown in emerging and developing economies (EDEs), including China. If global trade loses steam, it can have ramifications\tfor\trecovery\tin\tIndia. VII.4 Growth in India has decelerated faster than envisaged. Some slowdown was inevitable as\tgrowth\tsacrifice\twas\tneeded\tto\tcombat\tthe\t high\tinflation\tof\tthe\tpast two years. However, the lack of a quick policy response to address structural bottlenecks and encourage investment, has exacerbated the slowdown. In view of the growth moderation, the Reserve Bank in its Monetary Policy Statement 2012-13 on April 17, 2012 frontloaded the policy rate reduction with a repo rate cut of 50 basis points on the premise\tthat\tthe\tprocess\tof\tfiscal\tconsolidation\t critical\tfor\tinflation\tmanagement,\twould\tget\t under way along with other supply-side initiatives. However, the absence of movement on\tfiscal\tcorrection,\talong\twith\tother\tpersistent\t risks\tto\tinflation\tduring\t2012-13,\tlimit\tthe\tspace\t for monetary easing and the Reserve Bank decided to hold the policy rate in its Mid Quarter Policy Review on June 18, 2012. VII.5 On the domestic front, the macro- economic and structural factors that are impeding growth still remain to be addressed. At the current juncture, some uncertainty is arising\tfrom\tthe\ttemporal\tand\tspatial\tdeficiency\t in the monsoon. Despite the recent revival, cumulative rainfall up to July 27, 2012 was 21 per cent deficient. The Reserve Bank\u2019s production weighted rainfall index (PRN) showed a 39 per cent drop from the normal during June 2012. However, there has been some improvement since then and the PRN deficiency\tis\tnow\t24\tper\tcent.\tThe\timpact\tof\tthe\t monsoon will emerge more clearly in the coming weeks. VII.6 Monsoon risks to overall growth could turn out to be limited due to the declining share of rainfed agriculture with improved irrigation, as also the small share of total agriculture output in GDP. However, from a welfare standpoint, the\timpact\tmay\tbe\tsignificant\tbecause\tit\taffects\t the\tpoor\tthrough\tinflation\tas\twell\tas\tincome.\t This\talso\thas\tfiscal\timplications\tthrough\tdrought\t relief, MGNREGA and other government welfare schemes. VII.7 The slowdown in industrial activity continues. Mining activity remains at a near standstill in the face of a lack of adequate regulatory environment to support good business. Manufacturing activity also remains sluggish in the face of a rise in input costs and slack domestic demand. High inflation has impacted consumption, at a time when investment activity is already weak, making the immediate\trevival\tof\tgrowth\tdifficult.\tSubdued\t global demand amid weakening consumer confidence has weighed down on services growth, which may continue to experience some spillover from the slow industrial growth. While construction growth remains subdued, the \u2018trade, hotels, transport and communications\u2019 segment has also slowed down. VII.8 Taking into account the increased risks, the growth outlook in 2012-13 may turn out to be lower than anticipated. However, a recovery, even if modest, still appears possible if appropriate policy correctives are quickly put in place. Credit expansion in Q1 of 2012-13 has picked-up and PMIs for manufacturing and services remain in expansion mode. This suggests that while growth has decelerated, a sharp dip can still be averted. Inflation risks remain significant VII.9\t Headline\tinflation\thas\tmoderated\tfrom\t near double-digit levels and remained in the range of 7-8 per cent for the past seven months. The extent of moderation, in spite of the negative output gap, has been constrained by a number of off-setting factors such as rupee depreciation and sustained pressures from input costs and wages. Typically, episodes of high inflation have been marked by inflation persisting for 2-3 years and have required sustained\tefforts\tto\tlower\tinflation\texpectations\t and\tinflation. VII.10 The near-term outlook on inflation continues to be marked by a number of upside risks, despite the significant slowdown in growth.\tBoth\tpersistent\theadline\tWPI\tinflation\t and\tretail\tinflation,\teven\tas\tthe\tcore\tinflation\t remains moderate, indicate continued supply- side\tpressures\ton\toverall\tinflation.\tThese\tare\t unlikely to be mitigated in the near term. The progress of the monsoon so far has been unsatisfactory. Some price pressures could emerge in coarse cereals, pulses and edible oils. The\tshort-term\ttrajectory\tof\tfood\tinflation\tcould\t shift upwards impacted by the adverse monsoon, large increases in the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) and structural pressures on protein inflation\tthat\tcan\tfurther\tbe\treinforced\tif\tfeed\t costs increase due to poor rainfall.

Business expectations indices suggest subdued business confidence VII.11 Various surveys portray weakening optimism about business prospects. The NCAER\tBusiness\tConfidence\tIndex,\twhich\t registered an improvement in business environment during April 2012, slid back during July 2012. Private sector firms appear apprehensive about the investment climate and their\tfinancial\tpositions,\teven\tthough\tcapacity\t utilisation levels remain relatively high. VII.12 The latest Dun & Bradstreet Business Optimism Index for July\u2013September 2012, conducted in June 2012 amid renewed domestic and global economic pressures, indicates increased pessimism, with a q-o-q decline in volume of sales, net profits, new orders, inventory and employee levels. Weak demand conditions are observed across sectors, especially in the intermediate and capital goods sectors.\tThe\tdemand\tfor\tfinished\tgoods\talso\t shows\ta\tsignificant\tmoderation,\tpointing\tto\ta\t further slowdown in capital expenditure by firms. VII.13 The CII business confidence index, however, registered moderate recovery, with almost three-fourth of the respondents expecting a 7 or higher per cent growth in 2012-13, with the primary concern being stagnancy in reforms. The survey indicates optimism about overall sales,\tnew\torders\tand\tpre-tax\tprofits\tin\tQ1\tof\t 2012-13, as results indicate a corresponding rise in the last quarter as well. VII.15 The Reserve Bank\u2019s 58th round of the Industrial Outlook Survey (http://www.rbi.org. in/IOS58), conducted during Q1 of 2012-13 with a sample of 1,404 manufacturing companies, showed a deterioration in business sentiments both in the assessment quarter Q1 and the expectations quarter Q2 of 2012-13. VII.16 The Business Expectation Index (BEI), a composite indicator based on several business parameters, shows moderation for assessment (Q1 of 2012-13) as well as expectation (Q2 of 2012-13) quarters (Chart VII.1). The fall in assessment index has been much sharper than the expectation index, indicating that the perceived plateauing was not realised. However, these indices remained in the positive growth zone (i.e., above 100, which is the threshold separating contraction from expansion). VII.14 Across surveys, higher input costs seem to be the major deterrent to business confidence (Table VII.1). The seasonally adjusted HSBC Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Indices (PMI) for both manufacturing and services (June 2012) suggest improved business conditions and rising output. Despite the increasing input costs, higher employment levels and rising output prices point to some optimism about growth revival. Business expectations remain positive. 1.

VII.17 Net response of major demand side parameters, viz., production, order books, capacity utilisation, exports and imports for Q1of 2012-13, remained positive, albeit, lower when compared on a y-o-y as well as a q-o-q basis. The outlook response shows similar results. VII.18 The results also point to lower optimism in\tthe\toverall\tfinancial\tsituation\tthrough\tH1\tof\t 2012-13.

While a higher percentage of respondents (on a net basis) assessed\tthat\tthe\tprofit\tmargin\tdeclined\tover\tthe\t last quarter, the outlook for Q2 of 2012-13 remains more or less balanced (Table VII.2). org.in/CCS9), conducted in June 2012, indicates that although the majority of respondents perceive current household circumstances to have improved, there has been a rise in the proportion of respondents reporting otherwise. This led to a fall in consumer confidence\tfor\tthe\tcurrent\tperiod.\tHowever,\tthe\t future expectations of households remained almost constant at the level observed in the last round (Chart VII.2). Consumer Confidence Survey indicates static future expectations External agencies see moderation in growth ahead VII.20 The revised GDP growth estimate for 2011-12 at 6.5 per cent came in sharply lower than the conservative estimates by external agencies (7.0-7.6 per cent).

Reserve Bank shows a downward revision in the median growth forecast for 2012-13 to 6.5 per cent.

The\taverage\tinflation\toutlook\thas\tbeen\trevised\t upward to 7.3 per cent for 2012-13 and moderation is expected from Q3 of 2012-13 onwards (Table VII.4).

Inflation and macro risks to condition growth-enabling policy actions VII.23 Domestic growth declined to its lowest in 29 quarters during Q4 of 2011-12. Early indications for Q1 of 2012-13 suggest that growth is likely to remain subdued. While growth\trisks\tare\tsignificant,\tpolicy\tchoices\thave\t been\tcomplicated\tas\tinflation\tremains\tabove\tthe\t comfort level. Further, inflation risks have increased\tand\tcontinue\tto\tconstitute\tsignificant\t risk to growth sustainability, thus making it imperative to not allow monetary conditions to aggravate these risks. Also, the wide CAD and high\tfiscal\tdeficit\tcontinue\tto\tlimit\tthe\tmonetary\t space and pose major challenges for macroeconomic policy. Though adjustments in the exchange rate could contribute to bridging the\tcurrent\taccount\tdeficit,\texcessive\tvolatility,\t particularly the risks of a downward spiral in the rupee, needs monitoring. Going forward, improved liquidity and monetary conditions suggest the possibility of a slow recovery in industrial growth. VII.24 Additional rounds of accommodative monetary policy across the globe, if sustained through 2012-13, can reverse the trend of falling commodity prices at some stage. Global food inflation\tis\talso\tlikely\tin\tthe\tface\tof\twidespread\t drought in US and elsewhere. Besides, monsoon shortfall\talso\tweigh\theavily\ton\tthe\tinflation\t outlook in India. Rising input costs have fed into output prices, though further pass-through may be limited. On the other hand, corporates are likely to raise prices to protect themselves against margin pressures in sectors where competitive structures are not in place and mark-ups can be protected. VII.25 The economy is now at a critical juncture where revival can be supported by restoring\tconfidence\tthrough\tpolicy\tactions\tto\t encourage investment. Removing constraints on FDI and improving the investment climate by moving quickly to address bottlenecks in infrastructure space are important. Also, speeding\tup\tfiscal\tconsolidation\tby\tputting\tin\t place an investment stimulus through large capital spending by the government but offsetting it by curtailing revenue spending by revamping the subsidy schemes could go a long way in reviving growth. Reviving infrastructure investment while addressing increased risks to lending to this sector is critical in this context. VII.26 In short, decisive policy action backed by credible commitment to a long-term strategy for correcting macroeconomic imbalances and stimulating investment is crucial at this stage to revive\tconfidence\tas\twell\tas\tprovide\tspace\tfor\t monetary policy to help sustain growth while keeping\tinflation\tunder\tcontrol.

Much of the global economy is in a synchronised slowdown, having lost the upward momentum seen in the early months of the year. Despite the slowing global economy, the outlook for commodity prices is uncertain. The situation in the euro area continues to cause concern even as the prospects of immediate default have been averted. While exports of emerging and developing economies (EDEs) have been dented by the weak global economic activity,\tcapital\tflows\tinto\tthem\thave\t declined markedly because of the strains in the euro area financial market conditions. 2. Domestically, the macroeconomic situation continues to raise concerns. While growth has slowed down significantly, inflation remains well above the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank.\tThe\tlarge\ttwin\tdeficits,\tviz. current account\tdeficit\t(CAD)\tand\tfiscal\tdeficit,\t pose\tsignificant\trisks\tto\tmacroeconomic\t stability. Against this backdrop of heightened global uncertainty and domestic macroeconomic pressures, the challenge for monetary policy is to maintain its priority of containing inflation and lowering inflation expectations. At the same time, monetary policy has also to be sensitive to risks to growth\tand\tfinancial\tstability. 3. In the above context, this Statement should be read and understood together with the detailed review in Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments released yesterday by the Reserve Bank. 4. This Statement is organised in four Sections: Section I provides an overview of global and domestic macroeconomic developments. Section II sets out the outlook and projections for growth, inflation and monetary aggregates. Section III explains the stance of\tmonetary\tpolicy.\tSection\tIV\tspecifies\t the monetary and liquidity measures. 5. The global economy is slowing down. In its latest update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised its projection for global growth in 2012 marginally downwards to 3.5 per cent, but has emphasised further downside risks to growth. In the US, output growth decelerated to 1.5 per cent (seasonally adjusted annualised rate) in Q2 from 2.0 per cent in Q1 of 2012. In the\teuro\tarea,\tgrowth\twas\tflat\tin\tQ1\tafter\t a contraction by 1.2 per cent in the previous quarter. In the UK, growth contracted by 2.8 per cent in Q2 of 2012 and 1.3 per cent in Q1. Output in Japan expanded by 4.7 per cent in Q1 after a low growth of 0.1 per cent in the previous quarter, supported by reconstruction related demand. The global manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) fell below the neutral level of 50.0 to 48.9 in June 2012 - the lowest in 3 years - suggesting contraction in manufacturing activity. The global composite (manufacturing and services) PMI at 50.3 in June 2012 suggests near stagnation. 6. The decisions by the European Commission (EC) Summit on July 2, 2012\timproved\tmarket\tconfidence,\tbut\t only temporarily. Without a sustained recovery in growth or moderation in sovereign debt stress, which are highly inter-linked,\tfiscal\tand\tfinancial\tstability\t pressures in the euro area remain the most significant source of systemic global risk. In recent weeks, renewed concerns about Greece and the need for greater collective support to Spain and Italy have amplified these risks. Consequently, the potential for negative spillovers to the euro area core countries and to the rest of the world have also increased. 7. Importantly, risks to global growth, which stem from persistent weakness in advanced economies, have increased with EDEs also exhibiting moderation in growth. Among the BRICS countries, growth in China fell from 8.1 per cent in Q1 of 2012 to 7.6 per cent in Q2. Growth also moderated significantly\tin\tBrazil\tand\tSouth\tAfrica\t in Q1. According to the IMF, growth in a number of major EDEs turned out to be lower than forecast by it earlier. 8.\t Inflationary\tpressures\tsoftened\t across advanced and emerging economies, reflecting both weaker growth prospects and moderation in commodity prices. International (Brent) crude oil prices declined from an average of about US$ 125 per barrel in March 2012 to an average of about US$ 95 per barrel in June 2012. In July, however, the average price increased to above US$ 100 per barrel. In advanced economies, spare capacity in both product and labour markets limits risks to core inflation. Among the BRICS countries,\tinflation\tfell\tsignificantly\tin\t China and Russia. It also eased in Brazil and South Africa. Even as growth in India is slowing, it is clearly an outlier insofar\tas\tinflation\tis\tconcerned. 9. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth decelerated over four successive quarters from 9.2 per cent in Q4 of 2010-11 to 5.3 per cent in Q4 of 2011-12. Significant slowdown in industrial growth as well as deceleration in services sector activity pulled down the overall GDP growth to 6.5 per cent for 2011-12, below the Reserve Bank\u2019s baseline projection of 7 per cent. 10. On the expenditure side, significant weakness in investment activity was the main cause of the slowdown.\tGross\tfixed\tcapital\tformation,\t which grew by 14.7 per cent in Q1 of 2011-12, moderated to 5.0 per cent in Q2 and then contracted by 0.3 per cent in Q3 before recovering to a growth of 3.6 per cent in Q4. Growth in private consumption also decelerated in 2011-12, even as it remained the key driver of growth. The positive impact of the rupee depreciation on exports is yet to be seen. 11. Growth in the index of industrial production (IIP) decelerated from 8.2 per cent in 2010-11 to 2.9 per cent in 2011-12. Further, IIP growth during April-May 2012, at 0.8 per cent, was significantly\tlower than the expansion of 5.7 per cent registered in the corresponding period of last year. The PMI rose marginally to 55.0 in June 2012 from 54.8 in May. The composite (manufacturing and services) PMI also rose to 55.7 in June from 55.3 in May. 12. During the ongoing monsoon season, rainfall up to July 25, 2012 was 22 per cent below its long period average (LPA). The Reserve Bank\u2019s production weighted rainfall index (PWRI) showed an\teven\thigher\tdeficit\tof\t24\tper\tcent.\t Further, the distribution of rainfall was very uneven, with the North-West region registering\tthe\thighest\tdeficit\tof\tabout\t39\t per\tcent\tof\tLPA.\tIf\tthe\trainfall\tdeficiency\t persists, agricultural production could be adversely impacted. 13. Capacity utilisation levels in Q4 of\t2011-12\tas\treflected\tin\tthe\tresults\tof\t the Reserve Bank\u2019s order book, inventories and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS) revealed the usual seasonal improvement over the previous quarter. However, lead information from the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey (IOS) indicates that capacity utilisation dropped in Q1 and Q2 of 2012-13. Moreover, overall business sentiment also moderated in both the quarters. 14. Headline Wholesale Price Index (WPI)\tinflation\tincreased\tfrom\t7.5\tper\t cent in April to 7.6 per cent in May before moderating to 7.3 per cent in June 2012. The\tstickiness\tin\tinflation,\tdespite\tthe\t significant growth slowdown, was largely on account of high primary food inflation,\twhich\twas\tin\tdouble-digits\t during Q1 of 2012-13 due to an unusual spike in vegetable prices and sustained high\tinflation\tin\tprotein\titems. 15.\t Fuel\tgroup\tinflation\tmoderated\t from 12.1 per cent in April 2012 to 11.5 per cent in May and further to 10.3 per cent in June on account of decrease in non-administered fuel prices, which in turn was due to decline in global crude oil prices. However, the reversal in crude oil prices in recent weeks may add to domestic\tinflationary\tpressure. 16. Non-food manufactured products inflation\twas\tat\t4.8\tper\tcent\tin\tMay\tand\t June 2012. The momentum indicator of non-food manufactured products inflation\t(seasonally\tadjusted\t3-month\t moving average annualised inflation rate), however, showed an upturn. Moreover, input price pressures persist due to both exchange rate movements and supply side constraints. Going forward, further pressure on non-food manufactured\tproducts\tinflation\tcannot\t be ruled out. The Consumer Price Index (CPI 17. new\tseries)\tinflation\tremained\tin\tdouble- digits in Q1 of 2012-13, driven by both food and non-food prices. The divergence between\tWPI\tand\tCPI\tinflation\twas\ton\t account of two factors. First, there are differences in the composition and weights of commodities, especially of food items in the two indices. Second, even\tin\trespect\tof\tsimilar\titems,\tinflation\t was higher in CPI than in WPI, suggesting that besides the incidence of higher service taxes, moderation in non-food manufactured products prices has not yet been transmitted to the retail level. The rate of increase in the prices of services, which is included in CPI but not in WPI, was also high. 18. Among other factors, urban households\u2019\tinflation\texpectations,\tas\tper\t the latest survey conducted by the Reserve Bank, increased slightly in Q1 of 2012-13 after a decline in the previous quarter. Notwithstanding some moderation,\twage\tinflation\tin\trural\tand\t urban areas remains relatively high. 19. An analysis of corporate performance in 2011-12, based on a common sample of 2,273 non- government\tnon-financial\tcompanies,\t indicates that the sales growth remained positive for the year even after adjusting for inflation. However, earnings decelerated due to an increase in expenditure, indicating decline in pricing power. Early results for Q1 of 2012-13 suggest that pricing power remained subdued. 20. While the money supply (M3) growth, at 14.3 per cent in mid-July, was marginally lower than the indicative trajectory of 15 per cent, non-food credit growth at 17.4 per cent was slightly above the indicative projection of 17 per cent. If we include banks\u2019 investment in commercial paper and other instruments, non-food credit growth was even higher at 17.7 per cent. 21. The flow of resources to the commercial sector, from both bank and non-bank sources, increased to `1.9 trillion in 2012-13 so far (up to July 13, 2012) as compared with `1.4 trillion during the corresponding period of last year. Amongst non-bank sources, resources raised through commercial paper\tincreased\tsignificantly. 22. Following the reduction in the repo rate in April, several commercial banks reduced their lending rates. The modal base rate of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) declined by 25 bps to 10.50 per cent during April-June 2012. Significantly,\ton\tthe\tbasis\tof\tthe\tweighted\t average lending rate (WALR) of commercial\tbanks,\tadjusted\tfor\tinflation,\t real rates are now lower than they were during\tthe\thigh\tgrowth\tfive-year\tperiod\t of 2003-08. Banks\u2019 actions on deposit rates, however, were muted due to the slowdown in deposit growth. Liquidity conditions have eased 23. considerably since the April Policy. The average daily net borrowing under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), which was 2.2 per cent of average net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in Q4 of 2011-12, declined sharply to 1.3 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13 and further to 0.7 per cent in July 2012 (up to July 26, 2012). The turnaround in liquidity conditions was due to a decline in government cash balances with the Reserve Bank, injection of liquidity of about `860 billion by way of open market operation (OMO) purchases of securities and increased use of the export credit\trefinance\tfacility\tby\tbanks\tafter\t the increase in the limit effected in the June Mid-Quarter Review. Reflecting\tthe\t improvement in the liquidity situation, the weighted average call money rate, which is the operating target of the Reserve Bank, stayed close to the policy repo rate. 24. During Q1 of 2012-13, yields on government\tsecurities\tsoftened\treflecting\t an improvement in liquidity, moderation in\tinflation\tand\tconcerns\tabout\tweakening\t of domestic and global growth. The 10-year benchmark yield was significantly\tlower\tat\t8.11\tper\tcent\ton\t July 26, 2012 as compared with 8.63 per cent at end-March 2012. 25. Housing prices continued to rise despite the decline in volume of transactions. The Reserve Bank\u2019s quarterly housing price index suggests that prices increased in Q4 of 2011-12 in most of the 9 cities for which the index is compiled. 26. During April-May 2012, while food subsidies were lower, fertiliser subsidies were more than twice the previous year\u2019s level. Clearly, if the target of restricting the expenditure on subsidies to under 2 per cent of GDP in 2012-13, as set out in the Union Budget, is to be achieved, immediate action on fuel and fertiliser subsidies will be required. 27. In 2011-12, the CAD rose to US$ 78 billion (4.2 per cent of GDP) from US$ 46 billion (2.7 per cent of GDP) in the previous year, largely reflecting a higher trade deficit on account of subdued external demand and relatively inelastic imports of petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) as well as gold and\tsilver.\tAs\tcapital\tinflows\tfell\tshort\t of the CAD, there was a net drawdown of reserves (on a BoP basis) to the extent of US$ 13 billion in contrast to a net accretion to reserves of more or less of the same order in the previous year. Reflecting the fragile global 28. situation, India\u2019s merchandise exports declined by 1.7 per cent to US$ 75 billion during Q1 of 2012-13. However, imports declined even more sharply, by 6.1 per cent, to US$ 115 billions led by a decline in imports of non-oil non-gold commodities.\tAs\ta\tresult,\tthe\ttrade\tdeficit\t was lower at US$ 40 billion in Q1 of 2012-13 as compared with US$ 46 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Based on preliminary data, services exports rose moderately by 3 per cent to US$ 35 billion, while services imports surged by 19 per cent to US$ 21 billion in Q1. Accordingly, net services exports of US$ 14 billion in Q1 of 2012-13 were lower by 12 per cent as compared with Q1 of 2011-12. 29. During 2012-13 so far (July 20, 2012), the 6-, 30- and 36-currency trade weighted real effective exchange rates (REER) depreciated in the range of 7-10 per\tcent,\tprimarily\treflecting\tthe\tnominal\t depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar by around 9 per cent. The depreciation was mainly on account of the\tslowdown\tin\tcapital\tinflows,\tthe\tlarge\t current account deficit, domestic economic uncertainty and growing apprehensions about the euro area problem. 30. Exchange rate depreciation in Q1 of\t2012-13\twas\tnot\tspecific\tto\tIndia;\t most EDE currencies also depreciated. However, among the EDEs with large current\taccount\tdeficits,\tthe\tdepreciation\t of the Indian rupee was relatively large, reflecting\tmoderation\tin\tcapital\tinflows. In the April Policy, the Reserve 31. Bank had projected GDP growth for 2012-13 at 7.3 per cent on the assumption of a normal monsoon and improvement in industrial activity. Both theses assumptions did not hold. The monsoon has\tbeen\tdeficient\tand\tuneven\tso\tfar.\t Also, data on industrial production for April-May suggest that industrial activity, despite some recovery, remains weak. In addition, several risks to domestic\tgrowth\thave\tintensified.\tFirst,\t global growth and trade volume are now expected to be lower than projected earlier. Given the greater integration of the Indian economy with the global economy, this will have an adverse impact on growth, particularly in industry and the services sector. However, the lagged impact of depreciation of the exchange rate could partly offset this. The\timpending\t\u201cfiscal\tcliff\u201d\tin\tthe\tUS\tin\t 2013, when temporary tax concessions expire and automatic spending cuts take effect, also entails additional risks to the growth\toutlook.\tSecond,\treflecting\tthe\t lagged impact of weak industrial activity and global slowdown, the services sector growth is also expected to slow down. On the basis of the above considerations, the growth projection for 2012-13 is revised downwards from 7.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent (Chart 1). 32. In the April Policy, the Reserve Bank made a baseline projection of WPI inflation\tfor\tMarch\t2013\tof\t6.5\tper\tcent.\t This was based, in part, on an assumption of\tnormal\tmonsoon.\tThe\tdeficient\tand\t uneven monsoon performance so far will have an adverse impact on food inflation. Notwithstanding some moderation, international crude oil prices remain elevated. This, coupled with the pass-through of rupee depreciation to import prices, continues to put upward pressure on domestic fuel price inflation. In addition, with the adjustment of domestic prices of petroleum products to international price changes still incomplete, embedded risks of\tsuppressed\tinflation\tcould\talso\timpact\t fuel prices in India going forward. The decline in non-food manufactured products inflation has not been commensurate with the moderation in growth. Input price pressures on account of exchange rate movements and infrastructural bottlenecks in coal, minerals and power may exert upside pressure on non-food manufactured products\tinflation. 33. Keeping in view the recent trends in food inflation, trends in global commodity prices and the likely demand scenario, the baseline projection for WPI inflation\tfor\tMarch\t2013\tis\tnow\traised\t from 6.5 per cent, as set out in the April Policy, to 7.0 per cent (Chart 2). 34.\t Although\tinflation\thas\tremained\t persistently high over the past two years, it averaged around 5.5 per cent during the 2000s, both in terms of WPI and CPI, down from its earlier trend rate of about 7.5 per cent. Given this record, the conduct of monetary policy will continue to condition and contain perception of inflation\tin\tthe\trange\tof\t4.0-4.5\tper\tcent.\t This is in line with the medium-term objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent with India\u2019s broader integration into the global economy. Monetary Aggregates 35. With nominal growth remaining broadly at the level envisaged in the April Policy, monetary aggregates are expected to move along the trajectories projected in the Monetary Policy Statement 2012-13. Accordingly, M3 growth projection for 2012-13 has been retained at 15 per cent and the growth in non-food credit of SCBs at 17 per cent. As always, these numbers are indicative projections and not targets. adversities in several parts of the world, the outlook for food and commodity prices, especially crude oil, has turned uncertain. These developments have adverse implications for domestic growth and\tinflation. The projections of growth and 36. inflation\tfor\t2012-13\tare\tsubject\tto\ta\t number of risks as indicated below: i) External risks to the outlook for the Indian economy are intensifying. Adverse feedback loops between sovereign and financial market stress in the euro area are resulting in\tincreased\trisk\taversion,\tfinancial\t market volatility, and perverse movements\tin\tcapital\tflows.\tWith\t the deteriorating macroeconomic situation in the euro area interacting with a loss of growth momentum in the US and in EDEs, the risks of potentially large negative spillovers have increased. India\u2019s growth prospects too will be hurt by this. ii)\t Reflecting\tthe\tsetback\tto\tthe\tglobal\t recovery as also weather-related iii) While inflation in protein items remains elevated due to structural demand supply imbalances, additional\trisks\tto\tfood\tinflation\t have\temerged\tfrom\tthe\tdeficient\tand\t uneven monsoon. This has the potential\tof\taggravating\tinflation\t and\tinflation\texpectations. iv) At current levels of the CAD and the\tfiscal\tdeficit,\tthe\tIndian\teconomy\t faces\t the\t \u201ctwin\t deficit\u201d\t risk.\t Financing the latter from domestic saving crowds out private investment, thus lowering growth prospects. This, in turn, deters capital inflows, making it more difficult to finance the former. Failure\tto\tnarrow\ttwin\tdeficits\twith\t appropriate policy actions threatens both macroeconomic stability and growth sustainability. 37. Keeping in view the slowdown in growth, the Reserve Bank front- loaded the policy rate reduction in April with a cut of 50 basis points. Subsequent developments suggested that even as growth\tmoderated,\tinflation\tremained\t sticky. Keeping in view the heightening risks to inflation, the Reserve Bank decided to pause in the Mid-Quarter Review (MQR) of June 2012, even in the face of slowing growth. 38. Against the backdrop of global and domestic macroeconomic conditions, outlook and risks, the policy stance in this review is shaped by three major considerations. 39. First, after moderating for a short period during December-January, headline\tWPI\tinflation\tedged\tup\tagain\t beginning February 2012 and has remained sticky, above 7 per cent, on account of increase in food prices, increase in input costs, and upward revision in prices of some administered items\tsuch\tas\tcoal.\tHeadline\tinflation\thas\t persisted even as demand has moderated and the pricing power of corporates weakened. Non-food manufactured products\tinflation\thas\talso\tnot\tdeclined\t to the extent warranted by the growth moderation.\tThis\treflects\tsevere\tsupply\t constraints\tand\tentrenchment\tof\tinflation\t expectations. 40. Second, growth decelerated significantly\tto\t6.5\tper\tcent\tin\t2011-12.\t Although more recent data suggest some pick up, overall economic activity remains subdued. Importantly, the current growth performance has to be seen in reference to the trend rate of growth\tin\torder\tto\tassess\tits\tinflationary implications. In this context, investment activity has remained subdued over the last two years. External demand has also remained weak due to the slowdown in global growth. Consequently, the post crisis trend rate of growth, which was earlier estimated at 8.0 per cent, has dropped to 7.5 per cent. While the current rate of growth is clearly lower than trend, the output gap will remain relatively small. Under these conditions, demand pressures on inflation can re-emerge quite quickly, exacerbating the existing supply pressures. Third, liquidity conditions play 41. an important role in the transmission of monetary policy signals. Although the situation\thas\teased\tsignificantly\tin\tthe\t recent period, it is necessary to ensure that liquidity pressures do not constrain the\tflow\tof\tcredit\tto\tproductive\tsectors\t of the economy. 42. Against this backdrop, the stance of monetary policy is intended to:    continue to provide liquidity to facilitate credit availability to productive sectors. 43. On the basis of the current assessment and in line with the policy stance outlined in Section III, the Reserve Bank announces the following policy measures. Repo Rate It has been decided to retain the 44. repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) at 8.0 per cent. 45. The reverse repo rate under the LAF, determined with a spread of 100 basis points below the repo rate, stands at 7.0 per cent. Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) Rate 50. The primary focus of monetary policy\tremains\tinflation\tcontrol\tin\torder\t to secure a sustainable growth path over the medium-term. While monetary actions over the past two years may have contributed to the growth slowdown \u2013 an unavoidable consequence \u2013 several other factors\thave\tplayed\ta\tsignificant\trole.\tIn\t the current circumstances, lowering policy rates will only aggravate inflationary\timpulses\twithout\tnecessarily\t stimulating growth. As the multiple constraints to growth are addressed, the Reserve Bank will stand ready to act appropriately. The MSF rate, determined with a 46. spread of 100 basis points above the repo rate, stands at 9.0 per cent. 47. per cent. 51. Meanwhile, managing liquidity within the comfort zone remains an objective and the Reserve Bank will respond to liquidity pressures, including by way of OMOs. 48. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks has been retained at 4.75 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). Statutory Liquidity Ratio 52. In a turbulent global environment, the risks of external shocks are high and the Reserve Bank stands ready to respond to any such shocks swiftly, using all available instruments. Expected Outcomes 49. \u2022 It has been decided to: reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks from 24.0 per cent to 23.0 per cent of their NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning August 11, 2012. 53. expected to: The policy actions taken are  anchor\tinflation\texpectations\tbased\t on the commitment of monetary policy\tto\tinflation\tcontrol;\tand maintain liquidity to facilitate smooth\tflow\tof\tcredit\tto\tproductive\t sectors to support growth. 54. The next Mid-Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2012-13 will be put The Second Quarter Review of 55. Monetary Policy for 2012-13 is scheduled for Tuesday, October 30, 2012. ", "file4": "Since the beginning of 2012, monetary 1. policy has been aimed at maintaining monetary conditions in line with the objective of containing in\ufb02 ation, while ensuring that liquidity conditions remain supportive of recovery. In this direction, the Reserve Bank used the available space to support growth by lowering the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 150 basis points on a cumulative basis, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) by 100 bps, the repo rate by 50 basis points and infusing over `1.7 trillion of liquidity through outright open market purchases. As a result, liquidity in 2012-13 so far has stayed in line with policy objective. Going forward, there is a need to calibrate monetary policy factoring in the evolving growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamics as also the progress that may be made in containing the twin de\ufb01 cits. Growth in Q2 of 2012-13 is likely to have 2. stayed low with no perceptible signs of improvement from the preceding quarter. Saving and investment rates have declined in recent years, pushing the economy\u2019s potential growth rate down to about 7 per cent. The reform measures announced since mid-September 2012 can help improve growth subject to quick implementation. As the policy environment, pace of clearances for projects and input supplies improve, the drag of stalled infrastructure investment on growth would decline. In\ufb02 ation has stayed sticky at around 7.5 3. per cent in 2012-13 so far. Non-food manufacturing in\ufb02 ation has not softened in spite of the negative output gap that has emerged as a result of slowing growth. Fiscal imbalances, past exchange rate depreciation and feeble supply response have impacted in\ufb02 ation. Going forward, in\ufb02 ation is likely to remain sticky in near months, but some relief may follow as demand-side in\ufb02 ationary pressures ebb after a period of high wage and cost push in\ufb02 ation. Global growth prospects weaken 4. Growth prospects, both in advanced economies (AEs) and emerging and developing economies (EDEs) have weakened in Q2 of 2012. In October 2012, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth projections for both these groups downwards. Weaker growth prospects largely re\ufb02 ect the impact of sovereign debt overhang and banking fragilities in the euro area coupled with \ufb01 scal multipliers impacting growth with on-going fiscal consolidation. Euro area risks have affected business con\ufb01 dence and caused world trade to decelerate. Consequently, several EDEs face weaker external demand on top of an already slowing domestic demand. Further downside risks to global growth stem from a possible \u201c\ufb01 scal cliff\u201d leading to sudden and sharp \ufb01 scal consolidation in the US. Global in\ufb02 ation likely to stay benign 5. With the slack in output and employment in AEs and falling growth in many large EDEs, global in\ufb02 ation pressures are likely to stay muted during rest of 2012. Global commodity prices are expected to remain range bound, but event risks can disturb the current stability. The renewed quantitative easing in some AEs poses Contagion risks persist in global \ufb01 nancial markets Risks of spillovers in global \ufb01 nancial 6. markets remain large despite of credible policy actions by major central banks. Unconventional monetary policies hinging on exceptional liquidity support and easy money have transitorily moderated uncertainties in the \ufb01 nancial markets keeping them in a risk-on, risk-off mode. However, the underlying stress has not diminished with incomplete deleveraging and un\ufb01 nished \ufb01 nancial sector reforms. This has kept the financial systems fragile and markets impacted by risk aversion. Growth remains sluggish, reforms may arrest downturn 7. Economic indicators suggest that the slowdown has continued in Q2 of 2012-13 with slack industrial activity and sub-par services sector performance. However, recent policy reforms should help, albeit with some lag, in contributing to arresting the downturn. They may support the recovery later upon successful implementation. The improved prospects for Rabi, following the reduction in monsoon de\ufb01 cit with late rains are also expected to contribute to improving growth and in\ufb02 ation outlook, even though the recovery may take some time to set in. Fiscal consolidation and removal of impediments to infrastructure investments hold the key to growth revival 8. Aggregate demand is weakening in 2012- 13 led by investment slowdown. Corporate sales growth has also moderated signi\ufb01 cantly. In spite of recent measures aimed at lowering \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cits, \ufb01 scal slippage is likely in 2012-13 reinforcing the need for further measures for fiscal consolidation to crowd-in private investment. Rebalancing of aggregate demand towards investment holds the key to growth revival. It is, therefore, necessary to remove the pending constraints in the power, coal and road sectors at the earliest. 9. External sector risks remain in spite of the improved balance of payments (BoP) during Q1 of 2012-13. Though the merchandise trade de\ufb01 cit in 2012-13 so far has been lower, it largely re\ufb02 ects contraction in import demand on the back of growth deceleration. Services trade surplus is lower, leaving the current account deficit (CAD) wide enough for re- emergence of \ufb01 nancing pressures should global risk aversion increase or domestic recovery falter. Recent measures, including those to augment FDI, should help in CAD \ufb01 nancing. However, external sector vulnerability and sustainable level of CAD would need to be considered, while framing medium-term trade and capital account policies. Reserve Bank infuses liquidity, calibrates monetary policy with evolving growth- in\ufb02 ation dynamics 10. Active liquidity management through reductions in the CRR, and the SLR backed by OMOs has kept liquidity largely in line with the policy objective, factoring in inflation persistence and the need to ensure credit supply to support growth. Liquidity conditions remained comfortable during Q2 of 2012-13. Monetary and credit aggregates, however, remained below the indicative trajectory. The current credit slowdown largely reflects tepid demand conditions and distinctively lower credit expansion in case of public sector banks, re\ufb02 ecting mainly their risk aversion engendered by deteriorating asset quality. Looking ahead, monetary policy will need to factor in output and in\ufb02 ation gaps, keeping in view the current trajectory of liquidity, monetary and credit aggregates. Markets respond to reform measures, but more needed to revive primary capital markets 11. Policy reform measures have shifted market sentiments, strengthening the equity prices and the rupee exchange rate. Gains for the bond markets have been limited despite of the G-sec auction calendar for the second half of the year remaining in line with the budgeted numbers. This may be due to markets factoring in the inadequate \ufb01 scal adjustment in the current year. There is need for steps to revive the primary capital markets so that \ufb01 nancing constraints for corporate investments are reduced. Inflation remains on a sticky path warranting caution for some more time 12. In\ufb02 ation has stayed sticky at around 7.5 per cent. Persistent non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation, despite the growth slowdown, has emerged as a concern. While the near-term in\ufb02 ation risks are on the upside, in\ufb02 ation should start moderating from Q4 of 2012-13. These expectations factor in the late revival of the monsoon that can have a salutary effect on current food in\ufb02 ation. With global in\ufb02 ation likely to remain benign and suppressed in\ufb02 ation pressures starting to recede, in\ufb02 ation could soften further in H1 of 2013-14. However, improved supply-responses and moderation of wage inflation is vital for bringing down in\ufb02 ation to comfort levels. Policy calibration needed as in\ufb02 ation risks persist, while growth remains weak 13. Business sentiments remain weak at the moment and global growth projections, including that for India, are getting revised downwards. Domestic constraints, especially in infrastructure space, have continued to impede investments. However, the falling growth cycle appears to have reached its trough. Recent policy measures have reduced macroeconomic risks, but speedy implementation and sustained reforms are important for turning the economy around. Meanwhile, in\ufb02 ation risks persist, warranting a cautious policy calibration. If macro-risks from in\ufb02 ation and twin de\ufb01 cits recede further, that could yield space down the line for monetary policy to respond to growth concerns. With both domestic and global factors that had impacted India\u2019s growth during 2011-12 remaining unresolved, growth remained sluggish during Q1 of 2012-13. Indicators suggest that the slowdown continued into Q2 of 2012-13 with slack industrial activity and sub-par services sector performance. Despite unconventional monetary easing by several advanced economies, global growth prospects have weakened since the previous quarter thus adversely impacting the near-term growth outlook for India. However, recent policy reforms by the government, albeit with some lag, should contribute towards arresting the downturn by easing some domestic constraints. Measures to remove constraints facing the infrastructure sector would be crucial for growth revival. Global growth prospects weaken over the previous quarter 2011, when global recovery had gained strength (Chart I.1). I.1 The global growth outlook has deteriorated further as the sovereign debt overhang, \ufb01 scal adjustments, banking fragilities and \ufb01 nancial market uncertainties, especially in the euro area, weighed on growth prospects. Sequentially, growth decelerated in Q2 of 2012 in the US, Japan and China while euro area and UK failed to register positive growth. Though there have been signs of a mild recovery in the US housing markets, the possibility of the occurrence of a US \ufb01 scal cliff poses a signi\ufb01 cant risk to the US and global recovery, despite the \u201copen-ended\u201d quantitative easing announced by the Federal Reserve. The \ufb01 scal cliff refers to a possible large reduction in the federal budget de\ufb01 cit between 2012 and 2013 on account of certain tax hikes and spending cuts becoming effective from January 2013. I.3 The US economy expanded by 2.0 per cent (annualised) in Q3 of 2012, faster than 1.3 per cent in Q1 of 2012. Euro area output contracted at a rate of 0.7 per cent (annualised) in Q2. The employment scenario in the AEs also continues to be grim. The unemployment rate in the US, however, declined to 7.8 per cent in September 2012 from 8.1 per cent in August 2012. I.4 Spillovers from AEs and domestic constraints have affected economic activity in EDEs as well. The BRICS economies continued to slow. China\u2019s growth decelerated for the seventh consecutive quarter to 7.6 per cent (y-o-y) in Q3 of 2012. Only Q2 data is available for the other countries. Russia\u2019s growth The IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook I.2 (WEO) released earlier this month, further marked down its global growth forecast for 2012 to 3.3 per cent from the July 2012 estimate of 3.5 per cent. This is mainly due to a downward revision in growth projection for EDEs to 5.3 per cent from 5.6 per cent in July 2012. The growth forecast for advanced economies (AEs) has been reduced by 0.1 percentage point to 1.3 per cent. The latest revision in global growth forecast for 2012 means a cumulative downward revision of 1.2 percentage points since April weakened further to 4.1 per cent in Q2 of 2012, decelerating continuously for three successive quarters. Brazil\u2019s growth fell for the tenth successive quarter to 0.5 per cent. South Africa\u2019s growth improved marginally, but has stayed below 3.0 per cent in the preceding four quarters. With risks to global growth and trade, near-term improvement in growth prospects for EDEs seems unlikely. I.5 Global industrial production grew at the rate of 1.7 per cent in August 2012, its slowest pace since zero growth in November 2009 (Chart I.2). Lead indicators such as Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) suggest no signi\ufb01 cant improvement in Q3. The volume of world trade fell in July 2012 (Chart I.3). Slowdown in global industrial activity and trade could adversely impact India\u2019s growth prospects, given the inter- linkages. 1.0 -2.2 -1.1 -0.4 -0.6 -0.2 Source: World Bank Estimates. * as per cent of GDP. current account as well, though some offset may be available if global commodity prices fall. Risks from the impending US \u2018\ufb01 scal cliff\u2019 remain signi\ufb01 cant I.6 A major downside risk to global growth is now looming from the US \ufb01 scal cliff. The US Congressional Budget Of\ufb01 ce forecasts that the US \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit will decline by 3.3 percentage points to 4 per cent of GDP in 2013. Such a sharp \ufb01 scal consolidation may have a deleterious impact on global growth (Table I.1). There could be an adverse impact of the US \ufb01 scal cliff on India\u2019s growth. If global growth slumps, there would be spillover impact on Growth in India was sluggish in Q1 of 2012-13 I.7 Growth during Q1 of 2012-13, at 5.5 per cent, was marginally higher than in the previous quarter, but much lower than the 8.0 per cent growth registered in the corresponding quarter of 2011-12. The deceleration was seen across all the three major sectors, particularly the industrial and services sectors (Table I.2). The slowdown in manufacturing has been particularly severe.

Negative output gap likely to persist in 2012-13 Since the second week of September I.8 2012, the government has announced a number of policy measures towards \ufb01 scal consolidation by reducing fuel subsidies and clearing stake sales in public enterprises. It has also taken several other reform measures (see Table VII.1 on reform measures). While these measures have helped improve sentiments, their impact on growth will be felt with a lag, particularly after the substantive implementation of the initiatives relating to FDI and infrastructure. The potential growth rate of the Indian I.9 economy peaked around the middle of 2007-08, and has since continued its downward slide into Q1 of 2012-13 (Chart I.4). There are many methodological issues surrounding the estimation of potential output and the range of empirical estimates leaves considerable uncertainty. Nevertheless, what is clear is that potential output has been impaired as a result of the fall in savings and investment, high in\ufb02 ation and domestic structural impediments compounded by cyclical global slowdown. Current estimates suggest that potential growth may have now dropped to around 7.0 per cent. The output gap has been negative for four consecutive quarters. Delayed and uneven monsoon has impacted kharif production though rabi prospects seem better In 2012, not only was there a delay in the I.10 onset of the south-west monsoon, but its progress and distribution was uneven, especially during the crucial kharif sowing period of June and July. This resulted in delayed sowing of most crops. Although rainfall improved during August and September, the cumulative rainfall for the country as a whole (up to September 30) was 8 per cent below the LPA. The production- weighted rainfall index (PRN) constructed by the Reserve Bank indicated a de\ufb01 ciency of 13 per cent for the season as a whole (Chart I.5). I.11 De\ufb01 cient rainfall resulted in shortfall in area sown for several crops, notably coarse cereals and pulses (Table I.3). The delay in sowing, particularly in July 2012 adversely impacted the production of kharif crops in 2012 as indicated by the First Advance Estimates. Revival of monsoon during the latter half of the season and the governments contingency plans to tackle the drought-like situation, to an extent, helped in moderating the adverse impact of de\ufb01 ciency of monsoon during June and July 2012. The late recovery of rainfall, especially during September has improved soil moisture content and reservoir levels, thus improving the prospects for winter and rabi crops which could help in compensating for the loss of kharif crops. I.12 The current stock of around 67 million tonnes (September 2012) of rice and wheat is more than suf\ufb01 cient to meet the requirements of buffer norms (Chart I.6).

Price situation). There was also a spurt in futures prices of some agricultural commodities during June-July owing to concerns about a weak monsoon. I.13 The growth in index of industrial production (IIP) decelerated sharply during April-August 2012 compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. This was mainly due to a decline in capital goods production highlighting the slowdown in investment activity (Table I.4). The contraction of the mining sector also contributed to the slowdown in industrial production. Excluding capital goods, the growth rate of overall IIP during April-August 2012 was 2.7 per cent (Chart I.7). I.14 The slowdown in industrial activity is reflected across all sectors. Manufacturing sector output did not grow during April-August 2012, re\ufb02 ecting subdued investment activity and moderation in external demand. Major sub- sectors of manufacturing, such as electrical machinery and apparatus, motor vehicles, food products and apparel contributed signi\ufb01 cantly to the overall decline in growth of manufacturing 2.0 3.0 8.2 0.5 6.0 9.5 0.6 0.0 4.8 output. The mining sector continued to contract due to regulatory and environmental issues. Policy uncertainties with respect to coal and iron ore mining may act as a deterrent for this key sector. Power generation moderated sharply during April-August 2012, both on account of shortages in coal supply and uneven monsoon conditions. I.15 As per the use-based classification, moderation in growth was seen in all categories except consumer durables. The contraction in capital goods production during April-August 2012 mainly re\ufb02 ects weak investment demand. There has, however, been partial substitution by increase in capital goods imports, which increased signi\ufb01 cantly during this period. I.18 Recovery in domestic industrial production could also be contingent on a revival in global growth. A strong co-movement between domestic and global IIP is observed; the correlation coef\ufb01 cient of which during the period April 2008 to August 2012 was as high as 0.7 (see Chart I.2). I.16 An analysis of the relationship between production and imports of manufacturing goods industries during April 2010 to March 2012 con\ufb01 rms that there is a statistically signi\ufb01 cant and negative relation between domestic production and imports in the case of textiles and electrical machinery. The negative association implies that textiles and electrical machinery industries have been subject to some loss of competitiveness, resulting in the substitution of domestic output by imports (Chart I.8). I.17 To support revival in industrial growth, there is a need to take expeditious decisions to accelerate investments, especially by easing policy constraints and removing major supply bottlenecks. The recent proposal to set up a National Investment Board (NIB) is intended to improved co-ordination and expedite investment clearances of large projects thus helping to improve investment climate. However, since a large number of project clearances are also required at sub-national levels, it is important to improve coordination amongst all concerned agencies, including those which may be beyond the ambit of NIB. Revival of investment cycle hinges on resolution of policy uncertainties facing power and coal industries I.19 The growth of eight core infrastructure industries decelerated to 2.8 per cent during April-August 2012 compared to 5.5 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart I.9). Going forward, a reversal of downturn facing these industries essentially depends on revival of investment activity. This, in turn, hinges on resolution of policy uncertainties facing the power and coal industries. Despite large new power capacities reaching gestation stage during the Eleventh Five Year Plan, these capacities have not yielded the desired results due to input supply constraints. Though about 55 GW of new capacity creation was achieved, a large part of new capacity in thermal power was affected by coal shortages. The coal requirement for thermal power generation during 2012-13 is estimated at 476 million tones, but indigenous supplies may be only 407 million tonnes, requiring the balance to be met through imports. This demand-supply gap is projected to rise further during the Twelfth Plan. New plants that have been commissioned on the basis of coal linkage are facing severe constraints in the absence of committed Fuel Supply Agreements (FSAs). Besides, power projects are held up for want for various clearances. Also, distribution of power has come under \ufb01 nancial stress, with state power distribution companies (discoms) sitting on an accumulated debt of `1.9 trillion as on March 2011. A large amount of bank \ufb01 nance is stuck in bad loans to these discoms. I.20 However, over the past two months substantive progress has been made towards resolving outstanding issues confronting the sector. New FSAs that provide reasonable graded penalty clauses at pre-agreed disincentive triggers of 80 per cent of the Assured Coal Quantity (ACQ) are now approved by the Coal India Limited (CIL) and are expected to be signed shortly. A scheme of financial restructuring of discoms has now been put in place, which will aim at bringing about a \ufb01 nancial turnaround of discoms (see para II.16). However, a comprehensive solution to the coal supply issue lies in addressing supply shortages through imports in the interim backed by appropriate price pooling or effective alternative mechanisms, as also getting the coal blocks auctions going so that issue does not linger beyond the Twelfth Plan period. So, while existing measures are steps in the right direction, rest of the issues would need to be resolved expeditiously to kick start the investment cycle in the infrastructure sector once again. I.21 Other decisions in the recent period such as revoking the ban on certain categories of projects by allowing government land alienation and permission for clearance of up to 40 hectare of forest land at the regional level, are signi\ufb01 cant steps towards mitigating policy uncertainties. It has been decided that both forest and environment clearances would be processed simultaneously to avoid delays. Further, the recent policy initiatives such as permitting FDI in retail trade, civil aviation and power trading exchanges and rationalisation of diesel prices will help improve the investment climate. I.22 On account of the slowdown in economic growth, capacity utilisation measured by the 18th round of the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank was at a three-year low in Q1 of 2012-13 (http://www.rbi.org.in/OBICUS18). There is a strong co-movement between capacity utilisation and de-trended IIP manufacturing (Chart I.10). The survey further shows that there was higher growth in new orders, both q-o-q and y-o-y, the latter partly 5.7* due to a lower base.

This was largely due to the weak performance of \u2018trade, hotels, transport, storage and communication\u2019 sector. The contraction of the industrial sector and weak demand conditions have constrained the growth of the services sector. Leading indicators of the services sector point towards further moderation in growth going forward (Table I.5). This is also corroborated by the Reserve Bank services sector composite indicator (Chart 1.11). #: Data pertains to April-August. *: Data pertains to April-July 2012. $: Refers to wireless subscriber additions in actual numbers.

The announcement of these reform measures in themselves are not suf\ufb01 cient to ensure recovery as their impact would critically hinge on successful implementation. Recent reform initiatives may help in turning the tide I.24 The slowdown in the Indian economy has been due to both domestic as well as external factors. The crucial domestic factor impinging on growth was policy uncertainties and lack of reforms. Since September 2012, a number of reforms have been announced that should improve the investment climate and help attract more investment, domestic as well as foreign. Aggregate demand weakened further in Q1 of 2012-13, led by patchy investment demand. Corporate sales have moderated signi\ufb01 cantly. On the \ufb01 scal front, the de\ufb01 cit indicators have considerably widened. While the slowdown has had an impact on indirect taxes, both excise and customs, public expenditure remained high, particularly on subsidies. Recent initiatives taken by the government, especially those related to its expenditure on fuel subsidies are welcome but are less than adequate to avert \ufb01 scal slippage in 2012-13. Further steps will need to be taken soon. Protracted slowdown in private consumption and investment II.1 Expenditure side GDP growth moderated sharply to 3.9 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13 from 9.0 per cent in the corresponding quarter of previous year (Table II.1). Private final consumption expenditure and gross \ufb01 xed capital formation, which account for around 60 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, of GDP and which had both decelerated in the previous year, slackened further in Q1 of 2012-13. II.2 The downturn in investment, as explained in previous reports, was led by non-monetary factors, though interest rates also had a material : Quick Estimates. # : Revised Estimates.

Despite its well-known limitations, expenditure-side GDP data are being used as proxies for components of aggregate demand. effect. At the same time, government final consumption expenditure (which excludes transfer payments such as subsidies), which accounts for around 11 per cent of GDP, picked up sharply in Q1 of 2012-13, partly re\ufb02 ecting a base effect. II.3 The decline in the weighted contribution of net exports and valuables in Q1 of 2012-13 is in line with the balance of payments, in contrast to the data for the previous quarter (Table II.2). Significantly, discrepancies continue to vitiate expenditure data. The table shows that the sum of the contribution-weighted growth rates of the different expenditure components works out to only 1.9 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13, which is much lower than the growth rate of 3.9 per cent derived from the production approach GDP (\u2018supply side\u2019) after adjusting for net indirect taxes. Since the production-approach GDP is considered as the firmer estimate in the National Accounts Statistics, the difference between the expenditure side GDP derived from the supply side and that obtained from the different components of expenditure is reported as a statistical discrepancy. The discrepancy largely arises due to the lack of \ufb01 rm data on the expenditure components and the consequent use of indicator based approach by the CSO. Such large discrepancy complicates the assessment of aggregate demand in the economy for monetary policy. Moderation in sales growth coupled with decline in profits and contraction in margins re\ufb02 ect slack demand II.4 The subdued demand is re\ufb02 ected in the dampened sales of non-government non- financial (NGNF) listed companies. Sales growth decelerated to a 10-quarter low of 13 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13 (Table II.3). Further, due to a higher rate of growth in expenditure compared to sales, net pro\ufb01 ts declined by 10.7 per cent. The decline in net pro\ufb01 ts on a q-o-q basis was even sharper at 18 per cent (Table II.4). II.5 Lower growth in pro\ufb01 ts (EBITDA/EBIT/ net pro\ufb01 ts) relative to sales led to a decline in pro\ufb01 t margins (EBITDA/EBIT/net pro\ufb01 ts as 1.

There was a marked improvement in growth of net pro\ufb01 ts. However, the early results are from a small set of companies which are not representative of the overall corporate sector. Investment remained subdued in Q1 of 2012-13 II.7 Moderation in the cost of projects sanctioned by major banks/FIs for new corporate investment persisted during Q1 of 2012-13 (Table II.6). While the number of approvals declined sharply, there was a marginal increase in the envisaged cost of projects during the quarter. Industry-wise analysis of investment intentions reveals that the share of the power sector in the total planned investment was the highest (Chart II.2). #: For companies reporting this item explicitly. *: Other income excludes extraordinary income/expenditure if reported explicitly. 1.

There is a deviation from the projected fiscal consolidation path as the \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit during the \ufb01 rst \ufb01 ve months of 2012-13 comprised nearly two-thirds of the budget estimate for the year as a whole. On the current reckoning, the centre\u2019s gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit (GFD/GDP) ratio in 2012-13 is unlikely to see a significant improvement from that in the previous year. This underscores the need for taking further steps soon, in addition to the measures taken since mid-September 2012. refunds than a year ago (Chart II.3). The growth in indirect tax collections, however, has moderated during the period. Deceleration in industrial growth and foreign trade has affected collections under union excise duties and customs duties, respectively. Service tax revenue increased sharply over the period due to an increase in the service tax rates as well as the widening of the services tax base since II.9 On the revenue side, the net collections under direct taxes improved during April- August 2012, with a growth rate higher than budgeted for the year, mainly re\ufb02 ecting lower July 2012. For the year as a whole, the gross tax-GDP ratio, is likely to be much lower than the budget estimates, re\ufb02 ecting the impact of slowdown in economic growth on tax collections. expenditure indicators, specifying the underlying assumptions and risks involved. Subsidies remain high and likely to overshoot budget estimates II.10 Overall, there could be some shortfall in centre\u2019s revenue receipts. With regard to non- debt capital receipts, the government recently approved partial disinvestment of its equity holding in four public sector enterprises. Given the recent buoyancy witnessed in the stock markets, it may be possible to meet the budgetary target for disinvestment proceeds. II.11 Total expenditure growth during 2012-13 (April-August) was higher than in the corresponding period of 2011-12 and the budgeted growth for 2012-13. The expenditure on subsidies was more than two-thirds of the budget estimates. For the year as a whole, a signi\ufb01 cant slippage in all three major subsidies \u2013 food, fertilisers and petroleum \u2013 is likely, resulting in higher than budgeted non-plan expenditure. Consequently, a cut-back in plan expenditure is envisaged to restrict the \ufb01 scal slippage. II.12 The recent measures such as upward revision in diesel prices, restriction on subsidised LPG and levy of service tax on railway freight and passenger fares are steps in the right direction but further corrective measures are required to contain the fiscal deficit within sustainable limit. In this regard, the Committee on Roadmap for Fiscal Consolidation (Chairman: Dr. Vijay Kelkar) has made recommendations for policy interventions. The report set out the targets as well as the steps for course correction that need to be adhered to. In accordance with the stipulations of the amended Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003, the government has placed before the Parliament in September 2012, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework Statement which sets out a three-year rolling target for the II.13 Notwithstanding the recent price revisions and quantitative restrictions in administered petroleum products, the required compensation for under-recoveries of OMCs is estimated to be higher than budget estimates. Though the government had budgeted for an absolute decline in the amount of fertiliser subsidy in 2012-13, these have already crossed the budget estimate for the year as a whole. The food subsidy in 2012-13, as per of\ufb01 cial sources, is estimated to be `924.9 billion, an increase of around 24 per cent over the budget estimates. II.14 Rationalisation and reprioritisation of government expenditure is imperative for \ufb01 scal consolidation. Strategically, overall expenditure on subsidies needs to be restricted, and complemented with better targeting and distribution in accordance with policy priorities. Direct cash transfer of subsidies in food, fertilisers and petroleum will help towards subsidy reduction. Financial restructuring of state distribution companies may have medium to long-term implications for state \ufb01 nances II.15 The consolidated key de\ufb01 cit indicators of states are budgeted to improve in 2012-13 over 2011-12 (RE), re\ufb02 ecting the intent to carry forward \ufb01 scal consolidation in line with the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission (Table II.8). The consolidated revenue surplus for states is budgeted to increase in 2012-13, primarily through an increase in revenue receipts. The improvement in the revenue account is expected to reduce the fiscal deficit and primary deficit by 0.2 percentages points of GDP each and would also provide resources for higher capital outlay. The  0.1 -0.1 -0.4 term liabilities of the discoms to lending institutions would be converted into bonds issued by the former, backed by state government guarantees. These bonds are to be taken over within 2-5 years and converted into special securities by the state governments. The restructuring/ rescheduling will be subject to state governments and discoms taking certain prior steps to improve the operational performance of the discoms. The financial restructuring plan will hence not have any immediate implications for state \ufb01 nances as there is a moratorium on repayment of the principal for three to \ufb01 ve years and even the interest payment would be due only in the next \ufb01 scal. This will, however, have a medium- to long-term impact on the state \ufb01 nances. RE: Revised Estimates. BE: Budget Estimates. Note: 1. Minus (-) sign indicates surplus. 2.

II.16 The recently announced scheme for financial restructuring of state distribution companies (discoms) proposes a strategy for their \ufb01 nancial turnaround. As per the announced scheme, 50 per cent of the outstanding short- Fiscal consolidation and boost to investment is key to growth revival II.17 High fiscal deficit has impacted the macroeconomic climate and contributed to the investment downturn. A credible fiscal consolidation strategy is now on the anvil but needs to be backed by further measures. Overall demand conditions during 2012-13 have stayed depressed, due mainly to slack in investment. With a number of initiatives to address structural impediments and augment FDI, the investment climate should start improving. As the structural constraints facing investment get removed, there could be some revival in investment demand going forward. India\u2019s balance of payments (BoP), which had deteriorated sharply in 2011-12, showed some improvement in Q1 of 2012-13. The merchandise trade de\ufb01 cit in H1 of 2012-13 has remained at the same level compared to H1 of 2011-12, as fall in exports due to sluggish global demand was almost equally matched by import contraction mainly re\ufb02 ecting slowdown in domestic economic activity. This, coupled with the trend of falling surplus in services trade over the medium term, is likely to leave the current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD) too wide for comfort. CAD \ufb01 nancing pressures can re-emerge in the face of event risks, although the recent policy measures announced by the government have helped boost portfolio in\ufb02 ows for now. The rupee strengthened on the back of these \ufb02 ows. Though external vulnerability indicators generally deteriorated in Q1 of 2012-13, India\u2019s net international investment position (NIIP) improved, largely due to valuation effects. Global growth uncertainties continue to impinge on export growth III.1 India\u2019s export growth, which had lost momentum in the second half of 2011-12, mainly owing to a slowdown in external demand, has shown further deterioration in 2012-13 so far (Table III.1). Exports contracted by 6.8 per cent in H1 of 2012-13, with the pace of decline turning more pronounced in Q2. This also shows that the expected positive effects of exchange rate depreciation on exports were muted by weak global demand in the more uncertain macroeconomic environment. Destination-wise data available up to August 2012 suggest that this uncertainty was particularly re\ufb02 ected in the considerable decline in exports to the euro area. Recently, growth in exports to China has also turned negative. Demand from other important export destinations, viz., the US and the OPEC countries however, remained somewhat intact. Export demand from most other regional and 6.8 -12.3 -5.5 -13.8 -5.3 -4.4 6.8 -9.4 -32.9 -4.6 non-traditional markets, in particular from Southeast Asia and Latin America, has moderated. III.2 Major exporting sectors that have been significantly affected due to weak external demand include engineering goods, gems and jewellery, textile and textile products and petroleum products. Apart from sluggish external demand, the softening of international commodity prices, particularly metal prices, might also have contributed to the reduced value of exports from some of these sectors. Despite the measures taken to ease economic and \ufb01 nancial conditions in the US and the euro area, the risk of a further worsening of global trade prospects continues. Against the backdrop of these uncertainties, achieving the export target of US$ 360 billion during 2012-13 looks challenging. the impact of a rise in customs duty, the policy to restrain gold loans by NBFCs and rupee depreciation. A decline in imports of export- related items and capital goods possibly indicates slowdown in export-oriented sectors and concerns relating to a slowdown in domestic investment. III.4 With fall in exports being almost equally matched with fall in imports in value terms, India\u2019s merchandise trade de\ufb01 cit at about US$ 89 billion in H1 of 2012-13 was at the same level as in H1 2011-12. Going forward, with global oil prices for the Indian basket remaining \ufb01 rm, a reduction in the total oil import bill may be dif\ufb01 cult. Further, export demand is likely to be constrained by deteriorating global growth prospects and decelerating global trade. Low import and export elasticities prevent improvement of trade balance despite signi\ufb01 cant depreciation III.3 Imports contracted by 4.4 per cent during H1 of 2012-13, mainly reflecting subdued domestic economic growth coupled with depressed export prospects (Chart III.1). While the signi\ufb01 cant deceleration in economic activity helped keep the growth in petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) imports at a moderate 6.8 per cent in H1 of 2012-13, non-oil imports declined by 9.4 per cent, largely led by signi\ufb01 cantly lower imports of gold. This possibly re\ufb02 ected III.5 Estimates show that the elasticity of India\u2019s non-oil exports to REER is around 0.4 with a lag of one year. This is essentially because of sizeable import content of exports and slower supply responses to price changes. Similarly, price elasticity of non-oil imports is estimated to be statistically insigni\ufb01 cant as it includes price insensitive components like gold and also fertilisers which does not have full pass-through. Furthermore, price elasticity of net POL imports is only 0.1. Even though these estimates are sensitive to the estimation methods, the time period used and the choice of variables, they indicate that the impact of depreciation of the exchange rate on India\u2019s exports and imports is low. Estimates assessing existence of \u2018J\u2019 curve effect show that changes in both overall trade balance (ratio of exports to imports) as also in the non-oil trade balance are statistically insignificant to REER movements. Fall in trade de\ufb01 cit and higher secondary income led to lower CAD in Q1 of 2012-13 encouraged by depreciation of the rupee. Nonetheless, the CAD-GDP ratio was marginally higher at 3.9 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13 compared with Q1 of 2011-12, mainly on account of lower nominal GDP in dollar terms partly due to depreciation of the rupee (Table III.2). Going forward, the trend in various components of services exports, particularly business services, and private transfers would largely depend on economic activities in trading partner countries and movement in the rupee exchange rate. Current indications are that CAD could widen again in Q2 of 2012-13. III.6 The impact of moderation in the trade de\ufb01 cit and improved net receipts on account of secondary income compared to Q1 of 2011-12, was discernible in a lower current account de\ufb01 cit in Q1 of 2012-13. Offsetting the impact of lower net receipts in services exports on CAD in Q1, secondary income, mainly representing private transfers, remained buoyant, perhaps Turnaround in FII \ufb02 ows may improve \ufb01 nancing of CAD III.7 Q2 of 2012-13 witnessed a turnaround in FII flows.

There was a surge in portfolio in\ufb02 ows after the reform measures were initiated in mid-September 2012, with net FII investment of over US$ 5.5 billion in a month and a half. FDI \ufb02 ows to India moderated to US$ 10.7 billion during April-August 2012 compared with US$ 19.6 billion during April- August 2011 (Table III.3). III.8 The strong FII inflows since mid- September 2012 are mainly the outcome of a perception change among foreign investors following policy measures announced by the government (refer to Table VII.1 for details).

Reserve is likely to be positive for capital \ufb02 ows to emerging economies like India. Nevertheless, the weak global and domestic growth outlook coupled with euro area risks may create uncertainty that can heighten global risk aversion. III.10 Among debt-creating flows, external commercial borrowings (ECBs) witnessed some recovery in Q2 of 2012-13 over the preceding quarter, but they remained substantially lower than Q2 of 2011-12. Despite the easing of policy measures with regard to ECBs in recent months, the Indian corporate sector seems to have shied away from raising ECBs, re\ufb02 ecting the rising risk aversion, as also the more limited demand for such funds given the rise in corporate leverage, and slack in investment demand. Given the exchange risk or hedging cost due to economic uncertainty, ECBs involve higher debt service cost in rupee terms for corporate borrowers. Flows under trade credit and NRI deposits have been robust so far. While rupee depreciation and deregulation/increase in interest rates accelerated the momentum in \ufb02 ows of NRI deposits in Q1, the pace of \ufb02 ows has moderated in recent months (Table III.4) III.11 Going forward, capital inflows will depend on credible implementation of reform policies, including \ufb01 scal consolidation, and global economic conditions. The recent announcement of QE3 by the US Federal Rupee exhibit strengthening bias on the back of FII in\ufb02 ows and QE III.12 Subsequent to a depreciation of 7.1 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13 over Q4 of 2011-12 (on average basis), the rupee remained relatively weak against the dollar in July-August 2012, largely guided by external developments. Nevertheless, net FII in\ufb02 ows of over US$ 3.7 billion during this period helped the rupee move in a narrow range of `54.6 to 56.4 per dollar. However, since the second week of September 2012, the rupee has shown recovery against the US dollar. This followed the announcement of QE3 by the US Federal Reserve that has since weakened the US dollar in the global currency markets, as also the surge in capital in\ufb02 ows to India following its reforms measures. Since October 8, 2012 however, rupee has weakened mainly due to demand for dollar by oil importing \ufb01 rms. Re\ufb02 ecting the trend in rupee in nominal terms, the REER based on 6-currency and 36-currency as on October 19, 2012 showed a depreciation of 4.1 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively, over end-March 2012 (Table III.5). 1.

Short-term trade credit witnessed a signi\ufb01 cant increase, due to higher utilisation of credit by oil companies because of the rise in international oil prices during the quarter. A noticeable aspect of the composition of external debt was that the stock of external commercial borrowings recorded a marginal decline due to higher repayments during the quarter (Table III.6). 1.

III.14 The CAD during Q1 of 2012-13 was largely financed through debt flows, with continued uncertainty in the global economy affecting the quantum of equity flows. However, the magnitude of increase in external debt was lower than that of the preceding quarter largely due to valuation gains of US$ 7.9 billion during Q1 resulting from appreciation of the US dollar against the Indian rupee and other international currencies. Thus, excluding the valuation gains, the stock of external debt as at end-June 2012 would have increased by 11.8 billion. External vulnerability indicators witnessed deterioration, but remain comparable with peers III.15 There was some deterioration in the major indicators considered for assessing the vulnerability of the external sector in Q1 of 2012-13 (Table III.7). Key indicators of external sector vulnerability, such as debt-GDP ratio, short-term debt as per cent to total debt as well as to foreign exchange reserves and import cover, deteriorated as at end-June 2012 compared to end-March 2012. billion at end-June 2012 from US$ 244.2 billion at end-March 2012. Accordingly, the NIIP/GDP ratio at end-June 2012 declined compared with that at end-March 2012. The improvement in NIIP was essentially on account of the valuation changes emanating from exchange rate movements (Table III.8). III.17 Historical data suggests some improvement in the major indicators of external vulnerability, such as foreign exchange reserves to total debt ratio, short-term debt to foreign exchange reserves and external debt to GDP ratio over the past two decades (Chart III.2). However, more recently, there has been some deterioration in these indicators. Short-term debt to total debt ratio has risen since 2004-05. Moreover, in the recent years, while the ratio of foreign exchange reserves to total debt has declined, the ratio of short-term debt to foreign exchange reserves has increased. These trends are a matter of concern although foreign exchange reserves provide a cushion.

According to the Global Development Finance Report, 2012, in terms of ratio of external debt to GNI at end-2010, India\u2019s position was the \ufb01 fth lowest among the top 20 developing debtor countries. In terms of short-term to total external debt stock, as also foreign exchange reserves to external debt stocks, India\u2019s position is comparable to other BRIC countries, except China. Even though China\u2019s short-term debt to total external debt ratio is very high, its foreign exchange reserves are also high, thus providing adequate cover (Chart III.3). III.19 In sum, India\u2019s external sector faces some sustainability issues that emanate from large current account imbalances. Although reserves coverage and manageable external debt provide some comfort, macro-\ufb01 nancial policies aimed at lowering in\ufb02 ation, containing demand by more restrained \ufb01 scal spending, improving trade competitiveness through structural and other policies and the direct use of trade policy measures would be needed for medium-term sustainability. Liquidity conditions have eased during 2012-13, as a result of calibrated and pre-emptive measures, which include OMO purchases and reduction in both the SLR and the CRR. The Reserve Bank also front loaded a reduction in its repo rate by 50 basis points in April 2012. However, with in\ufb02 ation remaining high, it has kept the policy rate unchanged since then. While the reserve money growth decelerated and broad money growth remained steady in Q2 of 2012-13, the aggregate deposit and non-food credit growth have been below the indicative trajectory. Going forward, the secondary impact of the CRR cut, appropriate liquidity conditions and seasonal pick-up in credit demand are expected to in\ufb02 uence the monetary aggregates, while the trajectory of the monetary cycle will be shaped by evolving growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamics. Reserve Bank injects liquidity to support credit \ufb02 ow, while calibrating monetary policy on growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamics IV.1 The Reserve Bank has calibrated monetary policy in line with evolving growth- inflation dynamics. Without fundamentally changing its policy stance that has primarily sought to contain inflation and inflation expectations over the past two years, it has been ensuring that liquidity conditions do not tighten excessively. As a result of the infusion of liquidity through CRR cuts of 125 bps in Q4 of 2011-12 and again by 25 bps in September 2012 (Table IV.1), coupled with over `800 billion of liquidity infusion through outright open market purchases during 2012-13 so far, liquidity conditions have remained easier in 2012-13 as compared with 2011-12. Besides, the Reserve Bank lowered the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) by 100 bps with effect from August 11, 2012 \u2013 a measure that was expected to support private credit. It also front-loaded a 50 bps policy rate cut in April, in anticipation of measures supportive of \ufb01 scal consolidation that have been partly taken in September 2012 (Chart IV.1). IV.2 Active liquidity management through CRR, OMO and SLR has kept liquidity largely in line with the policy objective that factored in the persistence of in\ufb02 ation at a substantially higher than the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level Note : 1. Repo indicates injection of liquidity. 2. Figures in parentheses indicate change in the key rates in percentage points. as well as the need to ensure that supply of credit is not a constraining factor for productive needs. Conditions transit back to a phase of comfortable liquidity IV.3 Since 2011-12, the liquidity conditions can be broadly divided into three distinct phases. After remaining within the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort zone during the \ufb01 rst phase from April 2011 to October 2011, the liquidity deficit crossed the one per cent of NDTL level (Chart IV.2). This large liquidity de\ufb01 cit was mainly caused by forex intervention and increased divergence between credit and deposit growth. The de\ufb01 cit conditions were further Reserve Bank. The increased use of the export credit refinance facility by banks after the increase in its limit announced in the Mid- Quarter review of June 2012 and the one per cent reduction in the SLR announced on July 31, 2012 also helped in improving liquidity conditions. aggravated by frictional factors like the build-up of government cash balances with the Reserve Bank that persisted longer than anticipated and the increase in currency in circulation. IV.4 The Reserve Bank had to actively manage liquidity to provide greater liquidity cushion to the \ufb01 nancial system, while at the same time guarding against the risk of resurgence of in\ufb02 ationary pressure. Consequently, liquidity conditions eased signi\ufb01 cantly in Q1 of 2012-13 and the extent of the de\ufb01 cit mostly returned to the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level from July 2012, marking the onset of the third phase. Three major factors that contributed to this turnaround in Q2 of 2012-13 were the injection of liquidity by way of open market operations (OMOs), decline in currency in circulation and a decline in government cash balances with the IV.5 Liquidity conditions improved signi\ufb01 cantly in July 2012 compared with June 2012, with average daily net liquidity injection under LAF declining to around `480 billion, which further declined marginally in August 2012. The first half of September saw a signi\ufb01 cant decline in liquidity injection, mainly on account of a decline in the government\u2019s cash balances. Anticipating possible pressure on liquidity in the subsequent period on account of advance tax payment, seasonal pickup in the credit demand and transitional pressure arising from the currency demand during the festive season, the Reserve Bank, in September 2012 reduced the CRR by 25 basis points, which resulted in around `170 billion of primary liquidity injection into the banking system. With advance tax out\ufb02 ows from the banking system, the average daily net liquidity injection increased to more than `700 billion in the second half of September 2012, which was less than the quarterly spikes generally associated with advance tax collections. There was no auction purchase under outright open market operation (OMO) in Q2 of 2012-13, although there were purchases of government securities through the NDS-OM trading platform. IV.6 The liquidity de\ufb01 cit eased in the \ufb01 rst week of October 2012, but it has increased once again from the second week of the month. With less than usual front loading by the banks, the spike was mainly on account of banks\u2019 demand for reserve requirements coupled with the rise in government\u2019s surplus with the Reserve Bank. The average daily net liquidity injection under the LAF was around `580 billion during October 1-24, 2012. IV.7 Overall, the liquidity stress in the banking system declined in Q2 of 2012-13. This was evident from the lower recourse to the marginal standing facility (MSF) by banks during this period. Despite the advance tax out\ufb02 ows and the increase in borrowing limit under MSF from April 2012, the SCBs did not avail of MSF in September 2012. Moreover, the monthly average call rate, which hovered between the repo rate and the MSF rate during November 2011-July 2012, declined subsequently and has mostly hovered below the repo rate since August 2012. Further, there was a sharp decline in volatility in the call rate in this \ufb01 nancial year so far, as measured by the standard deviation of the rate movements in a month (Chart IV.3). has addressed three crucial contemporaneous challenges, which include facilitating credit \ufb02 ows, ensuring smooth policy transmission and smoothing operational rate. Appropriate liquidity management provided a liquidity cushion to facilitate credit \ufb02 ows to the productive sectors of the economy. It, on the other hand, ensured that the drawls under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) broadly remained within the indicative target of (+/\u2013) 1 per cent of NDTL, thereby facilitating monetary policy transmission; and \ufb01 nally, the decline in volatility in the money market rate captured the central banks\u2019 tendency to smooth operational interest rate in line with an optimal monetary policy framework. Reserve money decelerated in Q2 of 2012-13 IV.9 There was marked deceleration in reserve money during Q2 of 2012-13. On the component side, while the currency in circulation growth (y-o-y) decelerated, the growth in banker\u2019s deposit (y-o-y) with the Reserve Bank declined and remained negative in the \ufb01 nancial year so far. This decline in bankers\u2019 deposits mainly re\ufb02 ects the reduction in impounded liquidity and, thus, the easing of liquidity conditions as envisaged by the 150 basis point CRR reductions since January 2012. The CRR adjusted reserve money (y-o-y) growth remained relatively stable and hovered around 12.5 in the \ufb01 nancial year so far, although it remained below the 16.5 per cent level recorded during the comparable period in 2011-12 (Chart IV.5 and Table IV.2). Broad money grew steadily in Q2 of 2012- 13 but remained below the indicative trajectory IV.10 During this financial year so far, the money supply (y-o-y) growth hovered around 13.6 per cent. While the deceleration in reserve money contributed to the lower broad money growth, the countervailing increase in the money multiplier, especially in Q2 of 2012-13, has contributed to steadying the monetary expansion. In Q2 of 2012-13, the increase in money multiplier has been driven by reductions in the currency-deposit ratio and the aggregate deposit to bankers\u2019 deposit ratio. With a CRR cut effective from the fortnight beginning September 22, 2012, there was a further reduction in the banker\u2019s deposit to aggregate deposit ratio, which lead to an increase in the money multiplier (Chart IV.6). Aggregate deposit and credit growth decelerated IV.11 On the component side, the year-on-year aggregate deposit growth has decelerated. It mainly re\ufb02 ected the underlying trend in time deposits, which constitute around 90 per cent of the aggregate deposit. The moderation in the net \ufb01 nancial saving rate of the household sector during 2011-12 partially re\ufb02 ected the slower growth in households\u2019 holding of bank deposits. Moreover, low real interest rates in time deposits and relatively high rate of returns in alternate assets (e.g., gold) might explain some part of the deceleration in time deposits (Chart IV.7). The sharp decline in aggregate deposits at end-Q2 could be due to the decline in deposit rates announced by various banks from September 7, 2012 as well as the advance tax Net Bank Credit to Govt. Bank Credit to Commercial Sector Net Foreign Assets of the Banking Sector Note: 1. Data are provisional. 2. *: Data pertain to October 19, 2012. out\ufb02 ow from the banking system. Following the seasonal pattern, the currency with the public also declined in Q2 of 2012-13. IV.12 Non-food credit growth, which had generally increased during Q1 of 2012-13, has decelerated in Q2. This has been mainly due to the slack investment demand and slowdown in the credit-intensive manufacturing sector. The increased risk perception of banks could also have played a role in the low bank credit disbursement. Despite the positive wedge between the y-o-y growth in credit and aggregate deposit, the wedge between the two narrowed in Q2 compared to Q1 of 2012-13. The decline in the divergence between these growth rates helped contain one of the structural factors causing de\ufb01 cit liquidity in the banking system during Q2 of 2012-13 (Chart IV.8). IV.13 There was a deceleration in credit growth (y-o-y) for all SCBs at end-September 2012. At the bank-group level, the deceleration was particularly sharp for the public sector banks (PSBs). As PSBs are the largest lenders in terms of outstanding credit, deceleration in their credit growth pulls down the overall credit expansion of all SCBs taken together. The credit growth of the foreign banks registered an even sharper deceleration. Private sector banks, which registered strong credit growth in the comparable period last year, continued to witness a robust credit growth (Table IV.3). IV.14 The deceleration in the credit growth re\ufb02 ected the slack investment demand, slowing economic activity and more importantly, deteriorating credit quality, especially in the case of PSBs. The ratio of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) to gross advances and the net NPA to net advances that had increased signi\ufb01 cantly during 2011-12, rose further in Q1 of 2012-13 across the bank groups (Table IV.4). The increases in these ratios were maximum for the PSBs, which account for the major part of the bank advances. The slippage ratio that indicates the fresh NPAs increased across the sectors signalling additional stress in the banking sector. Restructuring of standard assets also increased signi\ufb01 cantly for PSBs during Q1 of 2012-13. Deterioration in the assets quality and in the macroeconomic conditions resulted 1.

This led to a portfolio switch from credit creation to investments in G-secs on the back of large government market borrowing. The SCBs were holding around 28 per cent of their NDTL in SLR investments at end-September 2012. IV.15 An analysis of sectoral deployment of credit based on data from select banks (which cover 95 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all SCBs) for September 2012 reveals that the non-food bank credit growth (y-o-y) to industries, services and personal loans decelerated compared with the previous year. The year-on-year bank credit growth to industry at 15.6 per cent in September 2012 decelerated considerably, from 22.9 per cent in September 2011. Deceleration in credit growth to industry was observed in all the major sub-sectors, barring chemical and chemical products, cement Non-bank domestic sources dominated \ufb02 ow of resources to the commercial sector IV.16 The total \ufb02 ow of \ufb01 nancial resources to the commercial sector during 2012-13 (up to October 5, 2012) has marginally declined when compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. Though the decline in \ufb02 ow has been accounted for by both bank and non-bank sources, the \ufb02 ow from non-banks has remained an important source of financing to the commercial sector (Table IV.5). Among the non-bank sources, funds from domestic sources have witnessed an increase this \ufb01 nancial year so far, mainly due to the higher issuance of commercial papers and increase in net credit by housing \ufb01 nance companies (HFCs). Foreign sources of funding (up to September 2012), however, declined compared with the previous Source: Latest updated OSMOS database. * Includes LABs. # Based on the data collected from banks for special analysis.

Monetary and liquidity conditions evolving with growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamics IV.17 The movement of operational target (weighted average call rate) that tracks the policy rate has evolved in line with output and in\ufb02 ation gaps (Chart IV.9). Though the monetary policy was tightened due to large in\ufb02 ation gap, the economic slowdown could be attributed to several other factors apart from monetary tightening (see Chapter I). Despite appropriate liquidity conditions prevailing over most of Q2 2012-13, the deceleration in non-food credit The sovereign debt overhang continued to cause strains in global \ufb01 nancial markets. Signi\ufb01 cant monetary easing measures in the advanced economies ameliorated conditions temporarily, but credit and liquidity risks are still high. On the domestic front, the recently announced policy reform measures have induced investor optimism and led to enhanced market activity. The rupee witnessed a short spell of appreciation following the policy initiatives, though it somewhat weakened in recent weeks. However, the primary capital market, which still remains subdued, is unable to provide capital-raising options, and bring down the leverage ratios for \ufb01 rms to revive investments. Central banks\u2019 actions revive sentiments, but risks remain V.1 Global financial markets, which had undergone renewed turmoil for most part of Q1 of 2012-13, witnessed reduced stress since end- July. This followed the ECB President\u2019s statement on July 26, 2012 - that within its mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. Later, equity markets rallied in the \ufb01 nancial markets following the September 2012 announcements of \u201csterilised\u201d outright monetary transactions (OMT) by the ECB and an \u201copen-ended\u201d quantitative easing (QE-3) by the Fed (Chart V.1). The \u20ac500 billion permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), launched on October 8, 2012, further boosted market sentiments. V.2 Global risk-aversion among investors appeared to have eased since September with the credit default swap (CDS) spreads declining after the announcement of the policy measures (Chart V.2). Borrowing costs for euro area countries, especially Spain and Italy, have also fallen. V.3 Even after improvements in \ufb01 nancial market conditions, elevated bond yields in the euro area periphery compared to core euro area yields, signal continued concerns about risks in the euro area. Domestic money market rates eased re\ufb02 ecting improved liquidity conditions V.4 In India, the \ufb01 nancial market witnessed some stress during Q1 of 2012-13 with the equity markets underperforming and the rupee depreciating amid moderation in capital in\ufb02 ows. However, \ufb01 nancial market conditions improved signi\ufb01 cantly during Q2. Amidst comfortable liquidity conditions, the call money rate remained in line with the policy repo rate, even during the period of advance tax collections in September (see Chart IV.3). V.5 The rates in the collateralised segments (i.e., CBLO and market repo) moved in tandem with the call rate, but generally remained below it during Q2 of 2012-13. There was a shift in market volume in favour of CBLO and away from the call money in the overnight money market during Q2 (Table V.1). segment during Q2. While mutual funds (MFs) continued to be the major lenders in the CBLO segment, their share in total lending declined in the market repo segment. Nationalised banks emerging as the major lenders in the latter segment during the quarter. V.7 With lower demand for funds amidst credit slowdown, there has been a near 55 per cent q-o-q decline in the average fortnightly issuance of certi\ufb01 cates of deposits (CDs) to around `185 billion in Q2, and the weighted average effective interest rate (WAEIR) on CDs declined to 8.4 per cent in September 2012 from 9.3 per cent in June 2012. V.8 The corporate sector increased its average fortnightly issuance of commercial papers (CPs) by around 22 per cent (q-o-q) to `330 billion during Q2. The weighted average discount rate (WADR) on CPs declined to 9.0 per cent in September 2012 from 10.1 per cent in June 2012. \u2018Leasing and \ufb01 nance\u2019 and \u2018manufacturing companies\u2019 remained the major issuers of CPs. The yields on auction Treasury Bills (TBs) eased till October 23, 2012 in line with the declining short-term interest rates. G-sec yields decline marginally re\ufb02 ecting improved liquidity conditions V.6 Banks and primary dealers continued to be the major borrowers in the collateralised V.9 Yield movements during Q2 of 2012-13 were range bound, though with a softer bias. 1574.3 -913.0 -481.1 -462.2 -517.1 : Outstanding position. #: Average daily trading in corporate bonds. Note: In column 2, (-) sign indicates injection of liquidity. **: Average daily outright volume traded in central government dated securities. ##: Average daily turnover in BSE and NSE. Yields softened significantly in July 2012 mainly due to improved liquidity conditions and expectations that the monetary policy may be eased following market perceptions of abating in\ufb02 ationary pressures on the domestic front, and global cues of further slowdown in world economy. However, yields rose sharply on July 31, 2012, reacting to the Reserve Bank\u2019s policy announcement of a one percentage point cut in the SLR to 23 per cent while leaving the policy rate unchanged (Chart V.3). V.10 After some intermittent softening, the yields again hardened in mid-August following worse-than-expected in\ufb02 ation outcome, but the movement was checked by expectations of weak growth numbers for Q1 of 2012-13. Better-than- expected growth numbers, however, caused yields to temporarily \ufb01 rm up, but adherence to the budgetary numbers in the auction calendar for H2 of 2012-13 softened opening yields on September 28, 2012. However, pro\ufb01 t booking eroded the gains. Concerns about \ufb01 scal slippage have kept yields largely \ufb02 at during October 2012. V.11 Around 72 per cent of the budgeted borrowing programme of the central government through dated securities amounting to `4,090 billion has been accomplished so far. The weighted average maturity of dated securities issued up to October 23, 2012, increased to 13.6 years. There has been a general downward movement in the primary market yield during the \ufb01 nancial year so far. The weighted average yield of primary auctions stood at 8.43 per cent (Table V.2). Investor sentiment, however, was largely sustained. The bid-cover ratio stood in the range of 1.4 to 4.1. V.12 During 2012-13 so far, 25 states have raised `905.3 billion on a gross basis. The weighted average yield \ufb01 rmed up to 8.94 per cent as the yield spreads for 10-year state development loans issuances over the corresponding Government of India security, increased to 42-84 bps compared to a spread of 25-42 bps for the corresponding period of the previous year. Deposit and lending rates exhibit stickiness V.13 Following the reduction in the CRR in two steps by 125 bps during January-March 2012 and the reduction in the repo rate by 50 bps effective April 17, 2012, the modal deposit rate for scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) declined by 11 bps to 7.29 per cent during Q2 of 2012-13 while the modal base rate of SCBs continued to remain at 10.50 per cent (Table V.3). V.14 In general, there has been a convergence in average deposit and lending rates across public and private sector banks.

A few banks, mostly public sector banks, have already reduced their base rates. Reform measures announced by the government boost investor sentiments and lead to appreciation of the Rupee V.15 The rupee appreciated by 6.9 per cent in Q2 of 2012-13 (5.2 per cent in the month of September 2012 alone), driven by both global developments and domestic policy measures (See Table VII.1 and Chart V.4). However, since the second week of October 2012 the rupee has weakened. It stood at 53.63 on October 25, 2012. of \ufb01 ve years for import of capital goods; and rationalising overseas direct investment by Indian entities in respect of annual performance returns. Secondary equity markets improved with reform measures and FII in\ufb02 ows V.17 In the recent period (up to October 25, 2012), the Indian equity market witnessed gains on a y-o-y basis. At a level of 18,758, the BSE Sensex is 8.7 per cent higher than it was at the same time last year. Market sentiments, turned positive due to improved global liquidity conditions, FII in\ufb02 ows and the recent policy measures announced by the government. V.16 The Reserve Bank also undertook additional policy measures in September 2012 to facilitate capital inflows. These include enhancing the maximum permissible ECB for repayment of rupee loans and fresh rupee capital expenditure under the US$ 10 billion scheme from 50 to 75 per cent of average foreign exchange earnings realised during the previous three years; permitting infrastructure companies to avail of trade credit up to a maximum period However, governance issues and mixed Q2 results of some major companies pared some of the gains recorded earlier. During 2012-13 so far (up to October 23, 2012), FIIs made net investments of about `497 billion in the Indian equity market (Chart V.5). IPO market continued to be sluggish V.18 The primary market, on the other hand, showed mixed trends. Private placement and MFs witnessed substantial pick up during 2012- 13 so far, while the IPO market remained sluggish. During April-August 2012, the total resources mobilised through private placement grew by about 73 per cent (y-o-y), while the net in\ufb02 ow of funds into MFs schemes grew by around 41 per cent on account of the base effect. The MF inflows to the liquid and income schemes were higher, on the back of improved liquidity conditions while they were net sellers in the equity segment. withdrawn their proposals and two IPOs have not been fully subscribed in 2012-13 so far. V.20 The IPO market remained subdued due to weak investment demand arising from the slowdown in overall economic growth, persistent in\ufb02 ation and high \ufb01 scal and current account de\ufb01 cits. The IPO activity mirrored the trends in the secondary market, in line with cautious investor sentiments in the recent past. Second, many of the IPOs listed during 2011-12 are currently trading below their issue price. As on October 25, 2012, of the 34 IPOs listed in the equity market in 2011-12, 20 were trading below their issue price. Negative returns on IPO investments have adversely affected investor sentiments. Third, global IPO activities have also been subdued since 2011. During Q2 of 2012-13, the resources raised through global IPO markets were 48 per cent lower than in the previous quarter, even though the secondary equity market posted huge gains during this period. V.19 Both the number of issues and the amount raised through IPO issues are very low in comparison to the peak resource mobilisation achieved in 2007-08 (Chart V.6). Even the offer document i.e., Draft Red Herring Prospectus, \ufb01 led with SEBI during April-September 2012 declined by 90 per cent over the corresponding period in 2011-12. Many companies which had \ufb01 led their offer document to raise funds have Policy changes contemplated to support the capital market V.21 Apart from the policy reform measures mentioned earlier, the Kelkar Committee on \u2018Roadmap for Fiscal Consolidation\u2019 has made suggestions to revive the disinvestment programme.

All India index is a weighted average of city indices, weights based on population proportion. suggested setting up infrastructure debt funds to boost infrastructure \ufb01 nancing. transaction volume grew by 9.3 per cent (Table V.4). V.22 The SEBI has also taken various measures to revive mutual fund investments and IPO activity. MF companies will now have to shift to the \u2018one plan per scheme\u2019 model. Also, a proposal has been made for a mandatory \u2018safety net\u2019 to protect the interests of small investors. Further, substantial QE programmes of AEs along with low interest rates will boost global liquidity and revive FII in\ufb02 ows to the IPO market. FII in\ufb02 ows and reform measures that are fuelling the uptrend in the secondary market, may also have a positive impact on the IPO market. Investor con\ufb01 dence picks up, but further macro-\ufb01 nancial improvement is necessary V.24 With the continued slowdown in global growth, global investor sentiments remain muted, despite the recent bout of activity aided by policy measures, both global and domestic. Pending long-term solutions for the euro area crisis, global uncertainties continue to dominate. Nevertheless, the excess global liquidity in the wake of monetary easing measures by AEs, is expected to \ufb02 ow into emerging and developing economies (EDEs) in search of higher returns. Housing prices remain \ufb01 rm with rising volumes V.23 The Reserve Bank\u2019s quarterly House Price Index, based on data for 9 cities, indicates a q-o-q increase of 6.7 per cent at the all-India level. The annual increase in house prices show a marginal moderation in Q1, while the V.25 By pushing through a series of much awaited reform measures, the government has signalled a break in policy stasis. With the promise of more measures to follow, investor scepticism seems to have abated. However, further improvement in macro-financial conditions would be necessary. WPI in\ufb02 ation has stayed around 7.5 per cent during 2012-13 so far. This re\ufb02 ects a combination of factors: the spillover impact from \ufb01 scal imbalances, some pass-through from earlier exchange rate depreciation and feeble supply response. Persistence in the non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation, even as growth has slowed, has emerged as a concern. While the late revival of monsoon has helped cool the price pressure from commodities like vegetables, the projected shortfall in the kharif crop is likely to exert pressure on food prices, especially cereals, pulses and oilseeds. Though the administered price revisions effected in September 2012 will raise in\ufb02 ation in the near-term, they will also help in reducing the medium-term in\ufb02 ationary pressures by containing the \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit. The pressures on fuel in\ufb02 ation could soften if crude prices remain range-bound and rupee maintains a strengthening bias. Overall, the in\ufb02 ation path is expected to remain sticky in the near-term, barring major supply shocks. As global in\ufb02 ation conditions ease, India remains an outlier VI.1 Tepid growth, high unemployment and negative output gap along with weak demand have eased the in\ufb02 ation environment in the Advanced Economies (AEs). The average in\ufb02 ation for OECD countries declined to 2.0 per cent in August 2012 from 2.8 per cent in January 2012. India remains an outlier, with higher inflation than most Emerging and Developing Economies (EDEs), which re\ufb02 ects the role of structural as well as country-speci\ufb01 c factors. Further quantitative easing by AE central banks adds to global liquidity effects. However, the liquidity glut in AEs could get transmitted to EDEs given the interest rate differential, which may push up demand and lead to higher commodity prices. VI.3 Given the spare capacity in the US and the global economy, subdued wage pressures and limited impact of commodity prices on core in\ufb02 ation in AEs, pressures on in\ufb02 ation in the near-term may remain low. However, the medium-term impact of easing of liquidity on in\ufb02 ation and in\ufb02 ationary expectations cannot be overlooked. The impact of quantitative easing on commodity prices through the \ufb01 nancialisation of commodity markets is also likely to be a source of risk to in\ufb02 ation. VI.2 The monetary policy stance in most AEs remains accommodative of growth recovery (Table VI.1). The recent round of monetary easing by some central banks of AEs, notably the European Central Bank (ECB), US Federal Reserve (US Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) during September 2012 temporarily reduced \ufb01 nancial market stress and contributed to asset price build-up, particularly in equity markets as sentiments improved (for details see Chapter V). The exceptionally easy monetary policy of the US Fed and the BoJ is expected to weaken the dollar and yen and trigger gains in EDE currencies. This could feed into lower in\ufb02 ation in EDEs through exchange rate pass-through Global commodity prices remain volatile with uncertain outlook VI.4 International commodity prices increased markedly in Q2 of 2012-13, reverting from the moderation observed during Q1 (Chart VI.1a). The uptick in commodity prices in recent months has been driven by crude oil and food prices. However, metal prices have continued to decelerate since February 2012, except for the recent period, due to weak demand conditions in both AEs as well as EDEs. Taking into account the relatively subdued demand, given the growth slowdown and possible increases in oil production in OPEC countries, Brazil, Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation and the Jan 2012 to Oct 2012 (as on 25th Oct.) : Change is worked out from the minimum point of target range. #: Q3 (Jul-Sep). $: August.

However, the near-term path of energy prices could be conditioned by the Middle East geopolitics. food continue to remain signi\ufb01 cant and could turn out to be a source of in\ufb02 ation especially for countries that are net importers. In\ufb02 ation pressures persist in India despite weakening of growth momentum VI.5 Food prices, especially of wheat and coarse cereals, increased in recent months following supply disruptions in a number of countries (Chart VI.1b). The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that world cereal production in 2012 will be 2.6 per cent down from the previous year\u2019s record crop, but suggests that fears of serious global supply shortages are now behind us. Notwithstanding the early indications of improved crop conditions in 2013, the near-term price pressures on global VI.6 Headline WPI inflation (y-o-y) has remained sticky at around 7.5 per cent throughout the current financial year (7.8 per cent, provisional in September 2012). The build-up in price pressures continues to remain persistent as seen from the secular upward trend in the index (Chart VI.2). The momentum of price changes, as indicated by the 3-month moving average seasonally adjusted month-over-month changes in WPI, also indicates some uptick in the recent months (Chart VI.2d). VI.7 In the recent period, changes in administered prices have been a major driver of in\ufb02 ation (Chart VI.3). Revisions in coal prices in January 2012 and electricity prices in June 2012 led to higher in\ufb02 ation. The revision in diesel and LPG prices would add to in\ufb02 ation during the course of the year though it will help moderate in\ufb02 ationary pressures in the medium- term, by way of \ufb01 scal consolidation Food in\ufb02 ation remains elevated re\ufb02 ecting poor supply elasticities VI.8 Food in\ufb02 ation concerns persist. Although there has been some moderation in the in\ufb02 ation in fruits and vegetables in recent months following the late revival of the monsoon, a number of items within the primary food articles group witnessed significant price pressures (Chart VI.4a). In\ufb02 ation in cereals has reached double digits after more than two years, while pulses in\ufb02 ation has remained above 20 per cent since June 2012. Apart from the trends in primary food articles, there has been signi\ufb01 cant pressure on some manufactured food products like sugar and edible oils (Chart VI.4b). The de\ufb01 ciency of the monsoon during June and July 2012 impacted the crop prospects of key food products, which has translated into an increase in prices (Chart VI.5). capita consumption expenditure in rural and urban areas grew at an average rate of 8.7 per cent and 6.7 per cent per annum, respectively, during the period 2009-10 to 2011-12, compared with a growth of 1.4 per cent and 2.4 per cent per annum, respectively, during 2004-05 to 2009-10. Although these results could have been influenced by the fact that 2009-10 was a drought year, which could have led to underestimation of consumption, thereby giving a low base, the fact that real consumption expenditure expanded during a period of high food in\ufb02 ation indicates that the demand remains strong, feeding into higher price levels as supply elasticities remain low. VI.9 Since 2008-09 the average food in\ufb02 ation at 10.3 per cent has been much above the overall headline in\ufb02 ation of 7.6 per cent. Both supply and demand side factors could have played a role in keeping food in\ufb02 ation high. Signi\ufb01 cant increases in rural wages in recent years have contributed substantially to the increase in cost of production as productivity growth remains low. This has also led to a signi\ufb01 cant increase in the Minimum Support Prices for most crops. At the same time, increases in wages, both in rural and urban areas, could have pushed up demand for food, given that the share of food in total consumption basket is higher for wage earners than for other segments of the population. VI.10 The recently released key results of the NSSO 68th round survey (2011-12) on household consumption expenditure indicate that real per Fuel in\ufb02 ation re\ufb02 ects lagged pass-through; under-recoveries remain high VI.11 In\ufb02 ation in the fuel and power group remained in double digits since February 2010, except for July and August 2012. The uptick in fuel in\ufb02 ation to double digits in September 2012 was driven by revision in price of diesel and increase in prices of a number of freely priced fuel products. Electricity price increase since June 2012 also contributed to the pick-up in in\ufb02 ation in this segment. VI.12 Freely priced product prices moved in line with the changes in international prices, while administered fuel prices were not changed during June 2011- August 2012 (Chart VI.6). This has led to substantial build-up of under- recoveries to the tune of `856 billion during for diesel, `33.9 per litre for PDS kerosene and `468.5 per cylinder for subsidised domestic LPG. VI.15 Trends in global prices and exchange rates signi\ufb01 cantly impact domestic fuel prices, as more than 85 per cent of India\u2019s oil consumption is met through imports. Global crude oil prices (Indian Basket), which averaged US$112 per barrel during 2011-12 declined by 4.3 per cent to US$107 per barrel during 2012- 13 (up to September). Though crude prices have moderated from the levels witnessed in March 2012, the depreciation of the rupee, partly offset the favourable impact (Table VI.2). April-September 2012, with about 62 per cent of the under-recoveries coming from diesel. VI.13 Against this background, in September 2012 the government revised diesel prices by `5 per litre (excluding VAT) and capped the supply of subsidised LPG cylinders (of 14.2 kg) to each consumer to six cylinders per annum. Although the revision could put upward pressures on fuel in\ufb02 ation in the coming months, it will help in price stability over the medium term through \ufb01 scal consolidation. VI.14 However, even after the recent revision in oil prices, pass-through, which remains incomplete, has impacted the subsidies and the fiscal deficit (for details, see Chapter II). Currently (effective October 16, 2012), the estimated under-recovery by domestic oil marketing companies (OMCs) is `9.8 per litre VI.16 A stable rupee since the second half of September 2012 resulted in some moderation in the prices of freely priced fuel products in October 2012, as crude oil prices continued to remain range-bound. Pressure on fuel in\ufb02 ation could soften if crude prices remain range-bound and rupee maintain a strengthening bias. VI.17 The increase in electricity prices could further add to input cost pressures. The uncertainty regarding coal supply prospects following the de-allocations of many coal blocks by the government could also be a source of price pressures, if they are not compensated by imports. One positive impact of the revision in electricity prices is the improvement in the \ufb01 nancial conditions of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs). With more grid power forthcoming as a result of \ufb01 nancial improvement in the SEBs, there will be less dependence on genset power, thereby possibly reducing overall energy costs for producers. Generalised in\ufb02 ationary pressures persist VI.18 Non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation, the indicator of generalised in\ufb02 ationary pressures, remained above 5 per cent during 2011-12 so far (5.6 per cent in September 2012). The month-over-month seasonally adjusted annualised changes (3-month moving average) in WPI non-food manufacturing, though showed some moderation in the latest month, remain strong. 9.6 7.9* 1.9 Indicates the depreciation of the rupee against dollar. Source: Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). showing a price decline during the period where non-food manufactured products inflation remained elevated. Such a trend amidst the economic slowdown re\ufb02 ects the rigidities in relative price adjustments, which could keep core in\ufb02 ation high even when demand pressures remain muted. However, the reported price changes within non-food manufactured products in recent months indicate that the number of items reporting price increases has declined, while the number of items reporting price decreases has increased. This has not translated into a decline in overall inflation, as large positive changes in a few discrete items drive the overall change (Chart VI.8) VI.19 Within non-food manufactured products, the \u2018basic metals and metals products\u2019 and chemicals groups have been the major drivers of in\ufb02 ation (Chart VI.7). It is seen that the contribution of these product groups to in\ufb02 ation in non-food manufacturing has been signi\ufb01 cantly high compared to their weights. The recent pick-up in in\ufb02 ation in this segment has also been driven by the increase in the contribution of the textiles group, which had declined signi\ufb01 cantly and turned negative during the period of decline in non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation. Inflation in certain items contributes hugely to core in\ufb02 ation VI.22 Although the growth slowdown has been signi\ufb01 cant, the input cost pressures continued to remain persistent as seen from the HSBC Markit Purchasing Managers Index (PMI). Firms would be forced to pass on increase in input costs to output prices as the absorbing capacity has declined with signi\ufb01 cant decline in the pro\ufb01 t margins of corporates. This could also translate to persistence of non-food manufactured products inflation even with growth slowdown. Wage pressures remain persistent and could constrain in\ufb02 ation moderation VI.20 The contribution of individual commodities to the increase in non-food manufactured products prices has also been asymmetric. A few items, most notably gold and ornaments, ammonium phosphate and grey cement, have been contributing disproportionately to the in\ufb02 ation in non-food manufactured products inflation. While assessing the generalised price pressures from the movements in non-food manufactured products index, such disproportionate in\ufb02 uences need to be taken into account. VI.23 A major factor in high food prices and overall in\ufb02 ation is increase in rural wages; both in nominal and real terms. However, indications are that the pace of increase in rural wages Price adjustments have remained sticky downwards VI.21 Manufactured non-food products in\ufb02 ation has remained persistent during 2012-13 so far. The number of items showing a price increase signi\ufb01 cantly outnumbered the number of items moderated from a peak of about 22 per cent (y-o-y) in August 2011 to about 18 per cent in August 2012. This, along with an increase in in\ufb02 ation in rural areas in recent months, led to a moderation in real wage growth to about 8 per cent in August 2012 from 11 per cent in August 2011(Chart VI.9). There is a large variation in in\ufb02 ation and wage growth in rural areas across the major states, pointing to the presence of state speci\ufb01 c factors in conditioning the wage-price dynamics (Chart VI.10). VI.24 It is observed that even in the organised sector, the growth in staff costs grew at the rate of about 17 per cent during 2011-12 indicating persistent pressure from wage costs. After some moderation in the preceding quarters, the growth in staff costs again picked up in the recent quarter (Table II.3). CPI in\ufb02 ation continues to be above WPI VI.25 Inflation, as per the all-India new Consumer Price Index (CPI-combined (rural+urban)) remained elevated, with in\ufb02 ation for September 2012 at 9.7 per cent. The new CPI shows some moderation in recent months when the food and fuel components are excluded (Table VI.3). However, new CPI in\ufb02 ation excluding food and fuel component continues to remain higher than the comparable component of WPI. The contribution of the food and beverage group to overall in\ufb02 ation has increased in recent months, albeit marginally declining in September 2012. This has kept the overall in\ufb02 ation high even with a decline in in\ufb02 ation in the core component (Chart VI.11). The contribution of fuel & power and miscellaneous items (which includes services) in CPI in\ufb02 ation has declined in recent months. VI.26 Notably, significant divergences in in\ufb02 ation as measured by the WPI and the new CPI were observed in certain product groups such as condiments & spices, fruits & vegetables and clothing & bedding. A comparison of similar item groups under the two in\ufb02 ation measures indicates that except for fuel and power, CPI in\ufb02 ation is much higher than WPI inflation in most of the product groups. Differences in the weighting pattern, area coverage and coverage of markets could explain part of the divergence. This could also indicate that in\ufb02 ation is generally higher at the retail level than at the wholesale level, which could be due to factors such as higher transport and labour costs and rigidities within the supply chain. In\ufb02 ation path remains sticky; better supply response and enhancing productivity are critical for medium-term price stability. VI.27 Persistent in\ufb02 ation, even when growth has slowed signi\ufb01 cantly, has turned India into an outlier in a benign global inflation environment. From the supply side, high in\ufb02 ation in India re\ufb02 ects the lagged adjustments in prices of fuel as well as the role of structural factors. From the demand side, growth of real wages in excess of increase in productivity and high \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit have added to in\ufb02 ationary pressures. A sustained moderation in in\ufb02 ation, therefore, can be achieved through policy initiatives to address the structural constraints. Also there is a need to reduce unit labour costs by improving productivity levels in the economy so as to enable growth in real wages in a non- in\ufb02 ationary manner. VI.28 Going forward, the de\ufb01 cient and uneven monsoon and spikes in global food prices have added to concerns on food in\ufb02 ation. The revision in administered prices of oil could add to near- term price pressures, but could help improve the macroeconomic fundamentals. Although manufactured products inflation moderated during last quarter of 2011-12, it has remained sticky, as sustained input cost pressures, pass- through effects and signi\ufb01 cant wage pressures offset the impact of the slowdown in growth. In\ufb02 ation could remain around the current level in the near term and any signi\ufb01 cant moderation in in\ufb02 ation is conditional on improvements in structural factors. The in\ufb02 ation path for the current year in the face of moderation in growth and the negative output gap continues to be a concern. The dampened investment climate may revive gradually following the demonstrated intent for \ufb01 scal policy reforms and commitment to much-awaited active policy to propel the economy forward. This will help improve business sentiments which remained cautious driven by uncertainties in the global and domestic economies. External agencies and professional forecasters have signi\ufb01 cantly revised their growth projections for India downwards. If the announced domestic reform measures are well-implemented and complemented by further reforms, the economy would turn around, despite the current expectations and sluggish global growth. In the interim, cautious calibration is needed so that macroeconomic risks are contained. Recent actions by the government reduce macroeconomic risks, but implementation is important VII.1 Domestic growth has averaged 5.4 per cent over the previous two quarters. This is lower than the 6.5 per cent in 2011-12 and the crisis-affected growth of 6.7 per cent in 2008- 09. With an amalgamation of weaker economic indicators including falling savings and investment, rising twin de\ufb01 cits and in\ufb02 ation, potential growth also dropped by one percentage point in a little over a year. VII.2 Part of the slowdown was due to weak global growth amidst debt and \ufb01 nancial crises that has slowed down growth and trade across geographies. However, domestic factors have magni\ufb01 ed the growth slowdown in India. High and persistent inflation which necessitated monetary policy action to contain in\ufb02 ation and anchor in\ufb02 ation expectations, partly contributed to this. Monetary tightening was needed to consolidate macroeconomic stability and foster growth in the medium run. But, beyond this, inadequate movement on the policy and implementation fronts worsened the investment climate that had already suffered due to global uncertainties and the cyclical downturn in the Indian economy. VII.3 The slew of policy measures announced by the government, since mid-September 2012, have started addressing these concerns (Table VII.1). These reforms measures by themselves are not suf\ufb01 cient to address the macro and structural problems constraining growth and delivering the needed reduction in twin de\ufb01 cits. Yet, they mark a signi\ufb01 cant directional change. Speedy implementation of the proposed measures and further progress to contain twin deficits would be needed for sustainable recovery to set in. Economic downturn is getting arrested VII.4 By reducing the macro-\ufb01 nancial risks, the reforms should help arrest falling growth. Although, growth in Q2 of 2012-13 is unlikely to be signi\ufb01 cantly different, gradual recovery could follow later in the year. VII.5 Growth in 2012-13 has slowed more than anticipated due to multiple factors. The kharif crop has been adversely impacted following de\ufb01 cient monsoon. Good rainfall in August and September has improved the soil moisture content and reservoir levels, thus raising the prospects for a good rabi crop. However, agriculture is likely to pull the overall growth down as kharif crop shortfall may not be entirely recovered. VII.6 Contraction in mining sector continues following a clamp-down on illegal mining activity. Manufacturing output has stagnated as external demand as well as domestic investment and private \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure have decelerated. Services sector growth has also slowed as activity in trade, transport, hotels and Expected outcome \uf020 Diesel price hike by `5/litre Would reduce under-recoveries on sale of diesel by about `150 billion in 2012-13, making a small but signi\ufb01 cant contribution to \ufb01 scal consolidation. \uf020 Capping subsidised LPG cylinders at 6 p.a./household Would also lower suppressed in\ufb02 ation in the system, bringing medium-term bene\ufb01 ts, even though in\ufb02 ation may rise in the near term. \uf020 Up to 51% FDI in multi-brand and single brand retail subject to conditions \uf020 Up to 74% FDI in teleports, mobile TV and sky-broadcasting services. Moderate FDI in\ufb02 ows likely over next 1\u20133 years in retail. This will improve organised retail penetration, but its market share may still remain less than 10 per cent. Supply- chain management over the years should improve, helping to lower prices and improve consumer welfare. MSMEs would also bene\ufb01 t. Both exports and imports could rise. \uf020 Up to 49% FDI in aviation by foreign airlines. FDI in aviation would depend on restructuring and M&A. FDI in broadcasting may support digitisation through the cable and Direct-to-Home (DTH) segments over time. Raise `150 billion out of `300 billion budgeted for disinvestment the Union Budget 2012-13. Also improve ef\ufb01 ciency and market discipline and bring in greater shareholder accountability and better corporate governance in these PSUs. Reduction in withholding tax Reduced tax on overseas borrowings by domestic companies during July 2012\u2013June 2015 to 5 % from 20%, Subject to conditions Reduced cost for corporate borrowing abroad. This may increase debt in\ufb02 ows in the capital account. Accumulated losses of discoms are estimated at `1.9 trillion as at the end of 2010-11. The restructuring package may face several dif\ufb01 culties in implementation, but it is a signi\ufb01 cant step towards containing the \ufb01 nancial problems in the power sector. Proposal for National Investment Board (NIB) headed by the PM to clear infrastructure projects above a certain threshold. Faster clearances of infrastructure investment would provide greater clarity and reduce uncertainty. It would also avoid delays in the implementation of projects. Would help in capital infusion in insurance sector and also encourage domestic savings. Foreign investment ceiling in the pension sector at 26% or such percentage as may be approved for the insurance sector, whichever is higher. Would help tap a large pool of global savings to improve long-term growth in India. Such FDI would bring more stable capital in\ufb02 ows and bring about greater exchange rate stability. Approved by cabinet for placing it before the National Development Council (NDC) Would set the growth agenda for the next \ufb01 ve years with plans covering large infrastructure investments. Whether approval pending Cabinet approval pending IRDA, CBDT and CEBC noti\ufb01 cations pending NDC approval pending communication has been impacted given its linkages with the rest of the economy. VII.7 While a modest recovery can be expected later in the year as the investment climate improves, growth in 2012-13 will fall short of the earlier projection. In\ufb02 ation risks persist, warranting cautious policy calibration Notwithstanding the growth VII.8 deceleration, inflation remains significantly above comfort levels. This partly re\ufb02 ects the impact of past suppressed in\ufb02 ation that is now being re\ufb02 ected in current in\ufb02 ation numbers as administered prices are adjusted upwards. This has kept core in\ufb02 ation elevated in relation to the falling growth as cost-push pressures are getting re\ufb02 ected in prices. In addition, some latent demand-side pressures still persist, as there have been large wage inflation pressures in the economy in recent years. in Q1 and Q2 of 2012-13. NCAER\u2019s Business Con\ufb01 dence Index shows a declined in overall con\ufb01 dence over Q1 of 2012-13, but no change over a year. FICCI\u2019s business con\ufb01 dence survey, likewise, reveals a fall in the overall business con\ufb01 dence index in Q1 of 2012-13. According to FICCI, weak demand, high cost of credit and worsening employment prospects emerged as constraints. The CII Business Con\ufb01 dence Index fell during Q2 of 2012-13, reflecting low business sentiments. Stagnation in reforms and credit availability constraint emerged as important (Table VII.2). VII.11 Most of the responses for these surveys were received before the announcement of the reform measures. Those received later indicate improved business sentiments. The Dun & Bradstreet Business Optimism Index for Q3 of 2012-13 shows an improvement over the previous quarter, reflecting the improved sentiments. VII.9 Despite the recent moderation in the price of crude oil, liquidity impact of QE and geopolitical uncertainties constitute upward risks to commodity prices. On the domestic front, the reform measures-induced hike in administered prices would cause in\ufb02 ation to rise in the near-term but ease \ufb01 scal pressures in the medium-term, which will help soften in\ufb02 ation. Supply-side rigidities and less competitive market structures continue to put pressure on prices. For several commodities, the input cost pressures are signi\ufb01 cant. As a result in\ufb02 ation has now persisted for the third year, inspite of negative output gap, supported by the wage- price spiral that poses significant risk to medium-term in\ufb02 ation. In the short-run in\ufb02 ation may turn out to be slightly higher than anticipated. However, it is likely to soften from Q4 of 2012-13. Business sentiments are weak, but recent policy actions may improve con\ufb01 dence VII.10 Various business con\ufb01 dence surveys portray weak sentiment about business prospects VII.12 The seasonally adjusted HSBC Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for manufacturing remained \ufb02 at during September 2012, while that for services recorded the fastest expansion in business activity in the past seven months. However, input prices continue to rise in both sectors, while business expectations fell to a six-month low in the services sector. But there is a shift, however small, to a better outlook VII.13 The Reserve Bank\u2019s 59th round of the Industrial Outlook Survey (http://www.rbi.org. in/IOS59) conducted during Q2 of 2012-13 showed further weakening in the business sentiments of the manufacturing sector during the quarter. VII.14 The Business Expectation Index (BEI), a composite indicator based on several business parameters, declined to levels seen at the onset of the financial crisis in Q3 of 2008-09. However, the survey also revealed that the outlook for the ensuing Q3 of 2012-13 had improved marginally (Chart VII.1). VII.15 Demand conditions, as re\ufb02 ected in the net responses for production, order books, capacity utilisation, exports and imports, appear to have further weakened in Q2. However, the outlook for Q3 showed marginal improvement, except for exports and imports (Table VII.3). VII.16 The results also pointed to deterioration in the overall \ufb01 nancial situation in Q2 of 2012- 13, but showed a marginally improved outlook for the ensuing Q3. The cost of external \ufb01 nance is perceived to rise, but by a lower percentage of respondents. The cost of raw material is also expected to rise at a lower rate in the next quarter. The profit margin, which has been declining for the past few quarters, is expected to remain at the same level in Q3 of 2012-13. 1. Overall Business Situation 2. Overall Financial Situation 3. 4.

VII.18 The Current Situation Index, based on current perceptions of economic conditions, household circumstances, income, spending and price level, was estimated to be 106.2 compared with 106.7 in the preceding quarter. However, the Future Expectations Index, based on expectations of economic conditions, income, spending, price level, and employment prospects, declined substantially in this quarter (Chart VII.2). External agencies revise India\u2019s growth projections downwards VII.19 The latest forecasts of GDP growth by various agencies are in the range of 5.6 to 6.7 per cent (Table VII.4). These mark signi\ufb01 cant downward revision from their earlier estimates. The Asian Development Bank has lowered its growth forecast for India to 5.6 per cent from 6.5 per cent, citing delayed reforms contributing to falling investment and consumption, particularly in real estate and infrastructure. VII.20 The IMF also revised its growth projection for India downwards to 5.6 per cent in October 2012. In its World Economic Outlook, it noted that India\u2019s growth has suffered from waning business con\ufb01 dence amid slow approvals for new projects, sluggish structural reforms, policy rate hikes designed to rein in inflation, and flagging external demand. It added that given the high in\ufb02 ation, India cannot afford to loosen its monetary policy unless it slows down domestic demand with more \ufb01 scal adjustments. VII.21 Growth slowdown is also corroborated by the results of the 21st round of the \u2018Survey of Professional Forecasters\u2019 (http://www.rbi. org.in/SPF21) conducted by the Reserve Bank. The median growth forecast for 2012-13 has been revised downward to 5.7 per cent from the earlier 6.5 per cent. Overall, the GDP growth is expected to pick up from Q4 of 2012-13. Although, WPI in\ufb02 ation is expected to moderate from Q4 of 2012-13, it is expected to remain above 7 per cent till Q2 of 2013-14. The median : Corresponds to the latest World Economic Outlook projection of 4.9 per cent for GDP at market prices for calendar year 2012, revised downwards from 6.1 per cent in July 2012. 1 The forecasts re\ufb02 ect the views of professional forecasters and not of the Reserve Bank. forecasters also suggest some moderation in current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD), but a marked \ufb01 scal slippage in 2012-13 (Table VII.5). In\ufb02 ation expectations of households decline VII.22 The latest round of the Inflation Expectations Survey of Households (http://www.rbi.org.in/IESH29), indicates that the perception of the current quarter in\ufb02 ation (i.e., July\u2013September 2012), as well as the expectations on future in\ufb02 ation have decreased (q-o-q). The percentage of respondents expecting price rise \u2018more than current rate\u2019 in the next quarter has decreased. However, it has marginally increase in the case of expectation for the next year as compared with the last round. The survey was conducted before the diesel price hike. Credible policy co-ordination key to push the economy into growth gear VII.23 The policy actions announced by the government since September 2012 should be seen as major initiatives to reverse the course of the falling growth. As these measures are implemented and feed through the system, they will facilitate the recovery of India\u2019s realised as well as potential growth. Whether the recovery will be quick or slow-paced would depend on several factors, including global conditions, which at the moment are not very conducive despite some positive news on labour and housing markets in the US. However, the key to recovery lies in policy co-ordination among 1. Real GDP growth rate at factor cost (in per cent) a. Agriculture & Allied Activities 0.3 2.

VII.24 It is also necessary to retain focus on further improvement in macroeconomic conditions by lowering the twin de\ufb01 cits. This requires staying on the path of fiscal consolidation, keeping a tab on private consumption demand and supplementing it with selective use of expenditure-switching policies to lower the CAD. It is also important to ensure that in\ufb02 ation stays below the threshold beyond which high growth cannot be sustained. VII.25 The exchange rate is not a foolproof tool for addressing the challenges of structural in\ufb02 ation that we face today. Ultimately, \ufb01 scal policy needs to work towards expediting supply- side responses and keeping private consumption demand under reasonable control. VII.26 Monetary policy needs to be cautious in the interim, focussing on in\ufb02 ation while using the available space to support growth to the degree it can. Lowering in\ufb02 ation is important from consumer welfare and equity considerations, as also for sustainable growth over the medium-term. If risks to macroeconomy from in\ufb02 ation and twin de\ufb01 cit recede further, that could yield space down the line for monetary policy to respond to growth concerns.

Globally, even as the growth momentum has slowed, governments have had to manage the balance between fiscal consolidation and growth stimulus amidst visible signs that the two objectives are in conflict with each other. As the advanced economies (AEs) deal with these tensions and global demand conditions weaken, emerging and developing economies (EDEs) are also slowing down. 2. Liquidity infusions by central banks in AEs during the quarter have contributed to some stability in global financial markets. These measures cannot, however, substitute for robust structural solutions that can return the AEs to the path of recovery. At this stage, growth risks have risen and could well overwhelm the positive effects of enhanced liquidity. Moreover, with commodity prices still at elevated levels, notwithstanding some muted softening recently, risks of liquidity-driven price increases remain significant. Even as this process moves forward, the months ahead will be a period of heightened uncertainty for the global economy. Amidst this global slowdown and uncertainty, the Indian economy remains sluggish, 3. held down by stalled investment, weakening consumption and declining exports. However, recent policy initiatives undertaken by the Government have begun to dispel pervasive negative sentiments. As the measures already announced are implemented and further reforms are initiated, they should help improve the investment climate further. Meanwhile, the persistence of inflationary pressures even as growth has moderated, 4. remains a key challenge. In this respect, India is an exception to the global trend, which underscores the role of domestic structural factors. Of particular concern is the stickiness of core inflation, mainly on account of supply constraints and the cost-push of rupee depreciation. Consequently, managing inflation and inflation expectations must remain the primary focus of monetary policy. A central premise of monetary policy is that low and stable inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations contribute to a conducive investment climate and consumer confidence, which is key to sustained growth on a higher trajectory in the medium-term. Accordingly, over the past few quarters, monetary policy had to focus on inflation, 5. even as growth risks have increased. As recent policy initiatives by the Government start yielding results in terms of revitalising activity, they will open up space for monetary policy to work in concert to stimulate growth. However, in doing so, it is important not to lose sight of the primary objective of managing inflation and inflation expectations. 6. This policy review is set in the context of the above global and domestic concerns. It should be read and understood together with the detailed review in Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments released yesterday by the Reserve Bank. The Statement is organised in two parts. Part A covers Monetary Policy and is 7. divided into four sections: Section I provides an overview of global and domestic macroeconomic developments; Section II sets out the outlook and projections for growth, inflation and monetary aggregates; Section III explains the stance of monetary policy; and Section IV specifies the monetary measures. Part B covers Developmental and Regulatory Policies and is organised in six sections: Interest Rate Policy (Section I); Financial Markets (Section II); Financial Stability (Section III); Credit Delivery and Financial Inclusion (Section IV); Regulatory and Supervisory Measures (Section V); and Institutional Developments (Section VI). 8. Notwithstanding modest improvement in growth performance in parts of the world in Q3 of 2012, the global economy remains sluggish. In the US, growth in Q3 picked up relative to the earlier quarter. In the UK, after three consecutive quarters of contraction, growth turned positive in Q3. The euro area continued to experience contraction in output in Q2, and recessionary headwinds have persisted in Q3. Growth decelerated significantly in Japan. High unemployment relative to trend persisted in all major AEs, although in September the US unemployment rate declined to below 8 per cent for the first time in four years. As regards the other BRICS \u2013 Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa \u2013 they have also slowed in the first half of 2012, with China decelerating further in Q3. Reinforcing this perspective, the average level of the global composite PMI for Q3 remained nearly unchanged from the three year low in the previous quarter. In September, additional quantitative easing measures were announced by the US 9. Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan to which financial markets responded positively as reflected in the prices of risky assets and narrowing of spreads. According to the October 2012 Global Financial Stability Report of the IMF, however, risks to financial stability have increased since April as confidence in the global financial system remains fragile, notwithstanding greater monetary accommodation by central banks. 10. The loss of growth momentum that started in 2011-12 has extended into 2012-13 though the pace of deceleration moderated in Q1. Nevertheless, growth remains below trend and persisting weakness in investment activity has clouded the outlook. 11. After decelerating over four successive quarters from 9.2 per cent y-o-y in Q4 of 2010-11 to 5.3 per cent in Q4 of 2011-12, GDP growth was marginally higher at 5.5 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13. The slight improvement in GDP growth in Q1 of 2012-13 was mainly driven by growth in construction, and supported by better than expected growth in agriculture. 12. On the expenditure side, the growth of gross fixed capital formation decelerated from 14.7 per cent in Q1 of 2011-12 to 0.7 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13. The slowdown in growth of private consumption expenditure witnessed during Q4 of 2011-12 continued through Q1 of 2012-13. External demand conditions and crude oil prices have also remained unfavourable, adversely impacting net exports. 13. After declining for two consecutive months, the index of industrial production (IIP) posted a modest growth of 2.7 per cent in August. The upturn was visible in mining and manufacturing sectors. However, over the period April-August, industrial activity was lacklustre at 0.4 per cent as against 5.6 per cent during the corresponding period last year. Most significantly, reflecting the retrenchment of investment demand, capital goods production declined by 13.8 per cent during April-August. The seasonally adjusted manufacturing PMI in September was unchanged relative to 14. its August level, but was below its level in June. The headline services business activity index, seasonally adjusted, was marginally higher in September than in August. 15. Notwithstanding apprehensions earlier in the season, rainfall deficiency during the south-west monsoon was 8 per cent of the long period average (LPA). However, the uneven temporal and spatial distribution of the monsoon this year is expected to adversely impact the Kharif output. According to the first advance estimates, production of Kharif foodgrains at 117.2 million tonnes (MT) in 2012-13 will be lower by 9.8 per cent than the record output in the previous year. 16. According to the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), capacity utilisation of the manufacturing sector in Q1 of 2012-13 declined from the preceding quarter and a year ago. For Q2, business confidence, as measured by the business expectations index of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey (IOS), dipped relative to the previous quarter. 17. Headline WPI inflation remained sticky at above 7.5 per cent on a y-o-y basis through the first half of 2012-13. Furthermore, in September there was a pick-up in the momentum of headline inflation, driven by the increase in fuel prices and elevated price levels of non-food manufactured products. While this is in part attributable to some suppressed inflation in the form of earlier under-pricing being corrected, even after this, the momentum remains firm. Even while y-o-y inflation of WPI primary food articles moderated since July due to 18. the softening of prices of vegetables, prices of cereal and protein-based items such as pulses, eggs, fish and meat edged up. WPI food products inflation increased in September, mainly due to the firming up of the prices of sugar, edible oils and grain mill products. 19. Fuel group inflation registered a significant rise in September, primarily due to the WPI reflecting the sharp increase in prices of electricity effected from June, the partial impact of the increase in prices of diesel in mid-September and significant increase in non- administered fuel prices on account of rising global crude prices. 20. Non-food manufactured products inflation was persistent at 5.6 per cent through July- September and continued to exhibit upside pressures from firm prices of metal products and other inputs and intermediates, especially goods with high import content due to the rupee depreciation. The momentum indicator of non-food manufactured products inflation (seasonally adjusted 3-month moving average annualised inflation rate) also remained high. 21. The new combined (rural and urban) CPI (Base: 2010=100) inflation remained elevated, reflecting the build-up of food price pressures. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel groups ebbed slightly during June-September, from double digits earlier. Inflation based on the CPI for industrial workers recorded an upturn, primarily due to higher food inflation. The y-o-y increase in rural wages, though showing some moderation, has remained high. 22. Reflecting some softening in inflation from the high levels observed in the last two years, urban households\u2019 inflation expectations showed a marginal decline in Q2 of 2012-13, though they remained in double digits. The Reserve Bank\u2019s quarterly house price index suggests that house price inflation 23. remained firm in Q1 of 2012-13. Notwithstanding the increase in house prices, the volume of housing transactions grew y-o-y at a faster pace than in the preceding quarter. 24. An analysis of corporate performance in Q1 of 2012-13, based on a common sample of 2,308 non-government non-financial companies, indicates that y-o-y sales growth decelerated sequentially over the last three quarters, but remained positive after adjusting for inflation. Earnings, however, contracted sharply due to higher increase in expenditure relative to sales, indicating a decline in pricing power. The early results for Q2 of 2012-13 indicate that the drop in sales growth and earnings may be bottoming out. 25. Money supply (M3) moderated y-o-y to 13.3 per cent on October 5, 2012, lower than the indicative projection of 15 per cent set out in the Monetary Policy Statement 2012-13. This essentially reflected the deceleration of growth in aggregate deposits. Non-food credit growth at 15.4 per cent y-o-y was below the indicative projection of 17 per cent, reflecting the growth slowdown. Disaggregated data show that barring agriculture, credit growth decelerated on a y-o-y basis across all the major sectors, particularly infrastructure. The estimated total flow of financial resources from banks, non-banks and external 26. sources to the commercial sector at around `4,700 billion in 2012-13 (up to October 5, 2012) was lower than `5,000 billion during the corresponding period of last year. Apart from the decline in the flow of resources from banks, the flow from external sources declined on account of lower external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and foreign direct investment (FDI) into India. Following the cut in the policy repo rate in April and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) in 27. September, several commercial banks reduced their deposit and lending rates. During H1 of 2012-13, the modal deposit rates of scheduled commercial banks declined by 13 bps across all maturities and the modal base rate of banks also declined by 25 bps. 28. Liquidity conditions, as reflected in the average net borrowing under the LAF at `486 billion during July-September remained within the comfort zone of (+/-) one per cent of NDTL. However, liquidity conditions tightened in October, mainly on account of the build- up in the Centre\u2019s cash balances and the seasonal increase in currency demand, taking the average LAF borrowing to `871 billion during October 15-25, well above the band of (+/-) one per cent of NDTL. 29. During April-August, the Centre\u2019s fiscal deficit was nearly two-thirds of the budget estimate for the year as a whole. In view of evolving patterns of revenues and non-plan expenditure, the revenue deficit (RD) and the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) for 2012-13 are expected to be higher than budgeted. 30. During Q2 of 2012-13, yields on government securities (G-secs) eased and have remained range-bound in October. Equity markets also improved in Q2 of 2012-13 on account of revival in sentiment and the turnaround in foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows. 31. The adverse external environment and, in particular, the slump in world trade took its toll on export performance. Exports declined in September for the fifth month in succession. However, with imports also declining, the trade deficit in H1 of 2012-13 remained broadly at the same level as a year ago. In terms of external financing, net inflows on account of FDI and ECBs were sizably lower than in the first half of the preceding year, but the shortfall was largely offset by a surge in non-resident deposits and a turnaround in FII flows in Q2. Reflecting these developments, the nominal exchange rate of the rupee vis- a-vis the US dollar moved within a relatively narrow range during Q2 compared with its behaviour in Q1. Overall, in H1 of 2012-13, the rupee depreciated in nominal terms by 7.8 per cent. In real terms, it depreciated by 5.4 per cent. The impact of real depreciation on net exports is being offset by global demand conditions. 32. Global growth prospects have deteriorated further and downside risks have increased, even as monetary policy in AEs remains supportive. Much depends on concrete policy actions in the euro area to ease the sovereign debt stress, balance growth-friendly structural reforms with fiscal consolidation, and carry forward integration at the area level, particularly in banking and fiscal domains. In the US, determined political resolve to agree on a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy is critical to averting the fiscal cliff and to avoid once again encountering the debt ceiling deadline. In the absence of these efforts, the outlook for AEs appears bleak, with the risks of a prolonged downturn more real than before. Spillovers from AEs present a serious downside risk to the prospects for EDEs, notwithstanding their relatively stronger fundamentals and absence of financial strains. 33. In its October 2012 World Economic Outlook (WEO), the IMF scaled down its projection of world GDP growth for 2012 to 3.3 per cent from its July projections of 3.5 per cent, and for 2013 to 3.6 per cent from its earlier projection of 3.9 per cent. Since September 2011, the IMF has been scaling down its projection of global growth for 2012, evidencing persistent and more than anticipated weakness in the global economy. Inflation 34. According to the IMF (WEO, October 2012), consumer price inflation is likely to decline from 1.9 per cent in 2012 to 1.6 per cent in 2013 in AEs, and from 6.1 per cent to 5.8 per cent in EDEs. As a result of weakening of global economic activity, headline and core inflation are expected to ease. However, risks to this outlook remain as global commodity prices, particularly of crude oil, have corrected only marginally. Further accommodation in monetary policy in major AEs is likely to work in conjunction with supply constraints to keep commodity prices elevated and volatile. Domestic Outlook 35. In its April 2012 Policy, the Reserve Bank projected GDP growth for 2012-13 at 7.3 per cent. In the First Quarter Review (FQR) of July, this was revised downwards to 6.5 per cent on an assessment that risks to domestic growth from the global slowdown, weak industrial activity and slower growth of services had materialised. By the time of the Mid- Quarter Review (MQR) of September, growth risks had heightened on account of worsening global macroeconomic conditions, decline in domestic industrial activity and service sector growth falling below trend. Since then, global risks have increased further and domestic risks have become 36. accentuated by halted investment demand, moderation in consumption spending and continuing erosion in export competitiveness accompanied by weakening business and consumer confidence. Although industrial output picked up marginally in August and the services PMI showed a modest improvement in September, the outlook remains uncertain. Notwithstanding the improvement in rainfall in the months of August and September, the first advance estimates of the 2012 kharif production are somewhat less buoyant in comparison to the previous year. Accordingly, even while prospects for agriculture appear resilient, these considerations, the baseline projection of GDP growth for 2012-13 is revised downwards to 5.8 per cent (Chart 1). the overall outlook for economic activity remains subdued. On 37. Looking ahead, the path of inflation will be shaped by two sets of counteracting forces. On the downside, slower growth and excess capacity in some sectors will help moderate core inflation. Stable, or in the best case scenario, declining commodity prices will reinforce this tendency. An appreciating rupee will also help to contain inflationary pressures by bringing down the rupee cost of imports, especially of commodities. On the upside, persistent supply constraints may be aggravated as demand revives, resulting in price pressures. Rupee depreciation, which may result from global financial instability, will add to imported inflation. An important driver of inflation is the upsurge in both rural and urban wages, which is exerting cost-push pressures. Finally, as under-pricing in several products is corrected as part of the fiscal consolidation process, suppressed inflation is being brought into the open. As necessary a step as this is, it will result in higher inflation readings. 38. Taking into consideration the above factors, the baseline projection for headline WPI inflation for March 2013 is raised to 7.5 per cent from 7.0 per cent indicated in July (Chart 2). Importantly, it is expected to rise somewhat in Q3 before beginning to ease in Q4. 39. Although inflation has remained persistently high over the past two years, it is important to note that during the 2000s, it averaged around 5.5 per cent, both in terms of WPI and CPI, down from its earlier trend rate of about 7.5 per cent. Given this record, the conduct of monetary policy will continue to condition and contain perception of inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent. This is in line with the medium-term objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent with India\u2019s broader integration into the global economy. 40. Money supply (M3), deposit and credit growth have so far trailed below the indicative trajectories of the Reserve Bank indicated in the April Policy and reiterated in the July Review. Deposit growth has decelerated with the moderation in interest rates, especially term deposits. Credit growth has ebbed with the slowdown in investment demand, especially with regard to infrastructure, and lower absorption of credit by industry, in general. Keeping in view the developments during the year so far and the usual year-end pick-up, the trajectories of the monetary aggregates for 2012-13 are projected at 14.0 per cent for M3, 15.0 per cent for deposit growth and 16.0 per cent for growth of non-food credit. As always, these numbers are indicative projections and not targets. 41. The wedge between deposit growth and credit growth, in conjunction with the build- up of the Centre\u2019s cash balances from mid-September and the drainage of liquidity on account of festival-related step-up in currency demand, have kept the system level liquidity deficit high, with adverse implications for the flow of credit to productive sectors and for the overall growth of the economy going forward. Risk Factors 42. The projections of growth and 2012-13 are subject to several risks as detailed below: for remaining part of i) Downside risks to growth emanating from the global macroeconomic environment are now adjudged to be more elevated than at the time of the FQR of July and the MQR of September. Weak growth momentum and policy uncertainties are impacting the macroeconomic outlook of EDEs. Spillovers to the Indian economy through trade, finance and confidence channels could increase. Domestically, a revival in investment activity, which is key to stimulating growth, depends on a number of factors. In particular, recent policy announcements by the Government, which have positively impacted sentiment, need to be translated into effective action to convert sentiment into concrete investment decisions. ii) On the inflation front, despite recent moderation, global commodity prices remain high. While oil prices appear to have stabilised, balancing between weak demand prospects and abundant liquidity, upside risks from persistently high liquidity and geopolitical developments remain. Further, domestic prices of administered petroleum products do not reflect the full pass-through of global commodity prices, and under-recoveries persist. While corrections are welcome from the viewpoint of overall macroeconomic stability, their second-round effects on inflation will have to be guarded against. As regards food prices, drought conditions in important foodgrain producing areas of the world are likely to impart an upside and persistent bias to international food prices with adverse implications for all countries that have relatively high weights for food in their inflation indicators. The behaviour of food inflation will also depend on the supply response in respect of those commodities characterised by structural imbalances, particularly protein items. Finally, the persistent increase in rural and urban wages, unaccompanied by commensurate productivity increases, is also a source of inflationary pressures. iii) The large twin deficits, i.e., the current account deficit and the fiscal deficit continue to pose significant risks to both growth and macroeconomic stability. A large current account deficit poses challenges for financing it in the current global environment. In a situation of volatile capital flows, the deficit could exacerbate downward pressures on the rupee. A persistently large fiscal deficit reduces the space for a revival in private spending, particularly investment spending, without quickly re-kindling inflationary pressures. iv) Liquidity pressures pose risks to credit availability for productive purposes and could affect overall investment and growth prospects adversely. On the other hand, excess liquidity could aggravate inflation risks. In response to rising inflation pressures in the period January 2010 - October 2011, 43. the Reserve Bank started monetary tightening. This helped in moderating inflation from its peak of 10.9 per cent in April 2010 to an average level of 7.5 per cent over the period January-August 2012. Over this period, however, growth slowed down and is currently below trend. This slowdown is due to a host of factors, including monetary tightening. Since April 2012, the monetary policy stance has sought to balance the growth\u2013 44. inflation dynamic through calibrated easing. The transmission of these policy impulses through the economy is underway, and in conjunction with the fiscal and other measures recently announced, should work towards arresting the loss of growth momentum over the next few months. As inflation eases further, there will be an opportunity for monetary policy to act in conjunction with fiscal and other measures to mitigate the growth risks and take the economy to a sustained higher growth trajectory. It is important, however, to note that inflation turned up again in September. To some 45. extent, this reflected the partial pass-through of revisions of diesel and electricity prices which, notwithstanding their contribution to inflation, were absolutely necessary. Besides, underlying inflationary pressures reflected in non-food manufactured products inflation has remained stubbornly above comfort levels. Accordingly, it is critical that even as the monetary policy stance shifts further towards addressing growth risks, the objective of containing inflation and anchoring inflation expectations is not de-emphasised. 46. Against this backdrop, the stance of monetary policy is intended to: \uf020 manage liquidity to ensure adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of the \uf020 reinforce the positive impact of government policy actions on growth as inflation risks moderate; and \uf020 maintain an interest rate environment to contain inflation and anchor inflation 47. On the basis of current assessment and in line with the policy stance outlined in Section III, the Reserve Bank announces the following policy measures: It has been decided to:  reduce the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks by 25 basis points from 4.5 per cent to 4.25 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) effective the fortnight beginning November 3, 2012. 49. As as result of this reduction in the CRR, around `175 billion of primary liquidity will be injected into the banking system. 50. 8.0 per cent. The policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) has been retained at 51. below the repo rate, stands at 7.0 per cent. The reverse repo rate under the LAF, determined with a spread of 100 basis points 52. points above the repo rate, stands at 9.0 per cent. The Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate, determined with a spread of 100 basis The Bank Rate stands at 9.0 per cent. The reduction in the CRR is intended to pre-empt a prospective tightening of liquidity 54. conditions, thereby keeping liquidity comfortable to support growth. It anticipates the projected inflation trajectory which indicates a rise in inflation before easing in the last quarter. While risks to this trajectory remain, the baseline scenario suggests a reasonable likelihood of further policy easing in the fourth quarter of 2012-13. The above policy guidance will, however, be conditioned by the evolving growth-inflation dynamic. These actions and the guidance that is given are expected to: i. enable liquidity conditions to facilitate a turnaround in credit growth to productive sectors so as to support growth; ii. reinforce the growth stimulus of the policy actions announced by the Government as inflation risks moderate; and iii. anchor medium-term inflation expectations on the basis of a credible commitment to low 56. through a press release on Tuesday, December 18, 2012. The next Mid-Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2012-13 will be announced 57. January 29, 2013. This part of the Statement reviews the progress on various developmental and 58. regulatory policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank in recent policy statements and also sets out new measures. Since the Monetary Policy Statement of April 2012, risks to global financial stability 59. have increased, despite some improvement in markets associated with exceptional liquidity operations. In advanced economies, significant fiscal challenges could morph into broader macro-financial concerns. For emerging and developing economies (EDEs), financial stability risks are embedded in potential spillovers, apart from those associated with domestic challenges of managing slowdown in growth, while countering lingering inflationary pressures in some. These unsettled conditions have nevertheless spurred movements towards globalised regulatory reforms intended to make financial systems safer, less complex and more transparent, and financial institutions less leveraged, better capitalised and thus able to effectively manage various risks. Many of these reforms are at various stages of implementation. In India, in the face of a challenging global environment and a difficult growth- 60. inflation dynamic, developmental and regulatory policies have focused on building a sound, efficient and vibrant financial system that ensures the effective provision of financial services to the widest sections of society. Financial sector reforms have moved in step with evolving international best practices, but with a country-specific orientation. Accordingly, financial market development, credit quality, credit delivery, customer service and financial inclusion within a participative and consultative approach with involvement of all stakeholders have been pursued. 61. This review of Developmental and Regulatory Policies for SQR of Monetary Policy 2012-13 focuses on certain key areas while assessing the progress made on the measures instituted in recent policy statements: reviewing interest rate policies and products; carrying forward financial market development and strengthening the market infrastructure, including payment and settlement systems; further improving credit delivery and financial inclusion; expanding customer service initiatives; upgrading the regulatory and supervisory framework in terms of progress towards Basel III, risk based supervision (RBS), non- performing assets (NPAs) management/restructuring and resolution frameworks; and strengthening currency management. 62. In the Monetary Policy Statement of April 2012, it was noted that while interest rates on deposits are predominantly fixed, most of the retail loan products, especially home loans, are sanctioned on a floating interest rate basis, thereby exposing the borrowers to the uncertainties of interest rate movements and associated interest rate risk. In order to examine the issue, a Committee (Chairman: Shri K.K.Vohra) comprising external as well as internal experts has been set up to assess the feasibility of introduction of long-term fixed interest rate loan products by banks. \uf020 The draft report of the Committee will be put out on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website by mid-November 2012 inviting views/suggestions from the public/stakeholders. 63. Pursuant to the announcement made in the Monetary Policy Statement of April 2010, the reporting platform for over-the-counter (OTC) inter-bank foreign exchange forwards, swaps and options was launched in July 2012. It has been decided to extend this arrangement, in phases, in terms of a well-defined roadmap, so as to cover: \uf020 trades in foreign currency-rupee forwards and options, foreign currency-foreign currency forwards and options between banks and their clients under a suitable protocol to ensure confidentiality of client trades reported by banks to the repository. \uf020 currency (FRAs)/caps/floors/collars in foreign currency and client trades in rupee IRS. 64. As announced in the Monetary Policy Statement of April 2012, the report of the Working Group (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi) was put out on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website for feedback from market participants. Based on the feedback received, the Group finalised its report on August 10, 2012. The Working Group has recommended measures to promote liquidity in the secondary market, to improve retail participation in the G-secs market, and to develop the market for interest rate derivatives. Its recommendations include consolidation 14 of outstanding G-secs, gradually bringing down the upper limit on the Held to Maturity (HTM) portfolio, steps to promote the term repo market, centralised market makers for retail participants in G-secs in the long-run, and permitting cash-settled 10-year Interest Rate Futures (IRFs), subject to appropriate regulations. Some recommendations like truncating the time-window for bidding in the primary auction, and re-issuances of existing securities in State Development Loans have been implemented. Following the Group\u2019s recommendations, it has been decided to: \uf020 change the settlement cycle of the primary auction in Treasury Bills (T-Bills) from T+2 to T+1. \uf020 \uf020 standardise IRS contracts to facilitate centralised clearing and settlement of these contracts. 65. Operational guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. 66. consultation with stakeholders. The remaining recommendations are being examined by the Reserve Bank in 67. Under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999, it is obligatory on the part of exporters to realise and repatriate the full value of exports to India, and monitoring and follow-up in this regard is done by Reserve Bank through the Authorised Dealer banks. It has been observed that there has been an increase in the number of unmatched export transactions between customs and bank reporting which, in turn, attenuates export realisation follow-up. Accordingly, a Working Group (Chairperson: Smt. Rashmi Fauzdar) was constituted to identify gaps/lacunae in the current export reporting and follow-up procedure and to recommend suitable re-engineering of the system. The Group submitted its report on September 27, 2012, recommending implementation of an IT - based solution using a secured website of the Reserve Bank to update the export database on a real time basis to facilitate quicker follow-up/data generation/policy formulation. It has been decided: \uf020 to put in place the envisaged architecture by September 2013. 68. The fifth Financial Stability Report (FSR) of June 2012 observed that the domestic financial system remained robust, notwithstanding an increase in risks to stability. The Reserve Bank\u2019s Second Systemic Survey Review reflected concerns about evolving global risks. On the domestic front, lower growth, elevated inflation and high fiscal and current account deficits were identified as posing risks to financial stability. Despite rising NPAs in the banking sector, simulations of shocks under different scenarios for banks as at end-June 2012 showed that the system-level CRAR remained above the required minimum of 9 per cent. Banks also remained resilient to credit, market, and liquidity risks. However, distress dependencies between banks have risen, warranting closer monitoring. The Financial Stability Report reflects the collective assessment of the Sub-Committee of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on potential risks to financial stability. Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) and its Sub-Committees The Sub-Committee of the FSDC is assisted by two Technical Groups, viz., the 69. Technical Group on Financial Inclusion and Financial Literacy and the Inter-Regulatory Technical Group. In addition, the Sub-Committee approved the creation of an Inter- Regulatory Forum under the Chairmanship of the Deputy Governor in charge of banking supervision in the Reserve Bank with Executive Director level membership from other regulatory/supervisory agencies to institutionalise the framework for supervision of financial conglomerates (FCs) and for monitoring and management of systemic risks emanating from their activities. This Inter-Regulatory Forum would have responsibility for framing policies for FCs such as identification, group-wide risk management, and corporate governance as well as for conducting high-level supervision. The Forum would also seek to strengthen the supervisory co-ordination/cooperation mechanism amongst domestic supervisors for effective supervision. The Monetary Policy Statement of April 2012 mandated State Level Bankers\u2019 70. Committees (SLBCs) to prepare a roadmap covering all unbanked villages of population less than 2,000 and to notionally allot these villages to banks for providing banking services in a time-bound manner. Accordingly, detailed guidelines were issued to SLBC convenor banks on June 19, 2012. Furthermore, banks were advised to furnish details of allocation of villages to respective regional offices of the Reserve Bank by end-August 2012. Quarterly statements on district-wise and bank-wise progress in opening banking outlets are required to be submitted from the quarter ending September 2012 by the 10th of the following month to the Reserve Bank. 71. Moving towards universal financial inclusion has been a national commitment as well as a policy priority for the Reserve Bank. In order to spearhead efforts towards greater financial inclusion, the Reserve Bank constituted a Financial Inclusion Advisory Committee (Chairman: Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty). The collective expertise and experience of the members will be leveraged to explore viable and sustainable banking services delivery models focusing on accessible and affordable financial services, developing products and processes for rural as well as urban consumers presently outside the banking network and suggesting the appropriate regulatory framework to ensure that financial inclusion and financial stability move in tandem. The first meeting of the Committee will be held in December 2012. Redefining the Priority Sector 72. As indicated in the SQR of October 2011, the Reserve Bank constituted a Committee (Chairman: Shri M. V. Nair) to re-examine existing classifications and suggest revised guidelines with regard to priority sector lending. The Committee submitted its report in February 2012. Based on the comments/suggestions received, guidelines on priority sector lending were revised on July 20, 2012. The overall target under the priority sector for domestic scheduled commercial banks has been left unchanged at 40 per cent of the Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or 17 Credit Equivalent (CE) amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (OBE), whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year. Targets under both direct and indirect agriculture have also been kept unchanged at 13.5 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively. Foreign banks with 20 or more branches have been brought at par with the domestic commercial banks in terms of the target/sub-targets under priority sector lending. The target under the priority sector for foreign banks with less than 20 branches has been set at 32 per cent of ANBC or CE of OBE, whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year, without any sub-target. 73. To address concerns raised by banks on the revised priority sector guidelines, discussions were held with the Chairman and Managing Directors (CMDs)/Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and with operational heads of priority sector departments of select banks. Foreign banks have to prepare roadmaps for meeting the targets over a period of five 74. years and their performance vis-\u00e0-vis targets will be reviewed periodically. 75. Based on the feedback received, it has been decided that: \uf020 loans up to `20 million to partnership firms, cooperatives and corporates directly engaged in agriculture and allied activities under partnership, rural cooperative and corporate categories will also be classified as direct finance to agriculture. \uf020 bank loans to Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) for on-lending for housing up to `1 million per borrower, may be included under the priority sector, provided the interest rate charged to the ultimate borrower by the HFC does not exceed two percentage points above the lowest interest rate of the lending bank for housing loans. 76. Guidelines on additions/amendments have since been issued. 77. In the SQR of October 2009, the Reserve Bank had announced the introduction of repo in corporate bonds and issued the \u2018Repo in Corporate Debt Securities (Reserve Bank) from Directions, 2010\u2019 Federations/Associations of UCBs, it has been decided: requests \uf020 to include scheduled UCBs with strong financials and sound risk management practices as eligible participants to undertake repo transactions in corporate bonds. 78. Detailed guidelines are being issued separately. 79. Based on comments/feedback received from the public on the recommendations of the Expert Committee (Chairman: Shri Y. H. Malegam), it has been decided to initiate steps for setting up of new UCBs after issues relating to governance arrangements are resolved with the Government. The Committee on Financial Sector Assessment (Chairman: Dr. Rakesh Mohan and 80. Co-Chairman: Shri Ashok Chawla) had recommended that rural cooperative banks which failed to obtain a license by end-March 2012 should not be allowed to operate. The Reserve Bank, along with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), implemented a roadmap for issuing licenses to unlicensed state cooperative banks (StCBs) and district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) in a non-disruptive manner to ensure the completion of licensing work by end-March 2012.After considering the NABARD\u2019s recommendations for issuance of licenses, one out of 31 StCBs and 42 out of 371 DCCBs were unable to meet the licensing criteria by end-March 2012. Subsequently, the StCB and 16 of the 42 DCCBs were recommended by the 81. NABARD for issuance of licences, since these banks attained the licensing norms following release of funds by the State Governments. The remaining 26 DCCBs which have not met the licensing criteria within the extended period, i.e., before September 30, 2012 continue to be under directions. Task Forces set up by the Reserve Bank in these States for the purpose have observed that these DCCBs are unviable in their present form and their continued existence cannot be sustained. Various alternatives are being analysed to ensure that the cooperative structure in these States does not get adversely affected. 82. In order to examine issues of structural constraints and to explore strengthening of the rural cooperative credit architecture with appropriate institutions and instruments to fulfil credit needs, it was proposed to constitute a Working Group to review the Short-Term Cooperative Credit Structure (STCCS). Accordingly, the Reserve Bank constituted an Expert Committee (Chairman: Dr. Prakash Bakshi) to undertake an in-depth analysis of the STCCS and examine various alternatives with a view to reducing the cost of credit and the feasibility of setting up of a two-tier STCCS as against the existing three-tier structure. The report of the Committee is expected by end-December 2012. 19 In recognition of the problem being faced by the Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) 83. Sector, particularly with respect to rehabilitation of potentially viable sick units, the Reserve Bank had constituted a Working Group (Chairman: Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty), which recommended a change in the definition of sickness and in the procedure for assessing the viability of sick MSE units. It was decided that the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Government of India, would constitute a Committee to examine the proposal. Following the submission of the report by this Committee, it is proposed: \uf020 to modify the existing definition of sickness of micro and small enterprises (as defined in the MSMED Act, 2006) and lay down a procedure for assessing the viability of sick units in the sector. 84. Detailed guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. 85. Of the recommendations of the Committee on Customer Service in Banks (Chairman: Shri M. Damodaran) constituted by the Reserve Bank, 152 have been implemented, including 142 in respect of which the Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA) issued guidelines to banks. They include spelling out Most Important Terms and Conditions (MITCs) for products and services that are of critical importance to consumers; strict adherence by banks to the time schedule prescribed under extant regulatory guidelines for disposing of loan applications; and issue of ATM cards only at the option of the customers on written request. Ten recommendations implemented by issue of regulatory guidelines include instructions to banks on abolition of foreclosure charges on floating rate home loans; introduction of Basic Savings Account; Unique Identification Number (UID) as Know Your Customer (KYC) for opening of No Frills Account; and differential merchant discount/fee for debit cards. Banking Ombudsman Scheme (BOS) 2006 86. Drawing on the recommendations of the Committee on Customer Service in Banks and the suggestions given by the Rajya Sabha Committee on Subordinate Legislation in their 183rd report, a Working Group (Chairperson: Smt. Suma Varma) has been constituted in the Reserve Bank to review, update, and revise the BOS, 2006 in the light of the recommendations and suggestions. The Working Group is expected to submit its report by end-December 2012. 87. As announced in the Monetary Policy Statement of April 2012, the Reserve Bank issued guidelines on implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations on May 2, 2012 to all scheduled commercial banks (excluding LABs and RRBs). The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has finalised proposals on disclosure requirements in respect of the composition of regulatory capital, aimed at improving transparency of regulatory capital reporting as well as market discipline. As these disclosures have to be given effect by national authorities by June 30, 2013, it has been decided: \uf020 to issue draft guidelines on composition of capital disclosure requirements by end- December 2012. The BCBS has also issued an interim framework for determining capital requirements 88. for bank exposures to CCPs. This framework is being introduced as an amendment to the existing Basel II capital adequacy framework and is intended to create incentives to increase the use of CCPs. These standards will come into effect on January 1, 2013. Accordingly, it has been decided: \uf020 to issue draft guidelines on capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties, based on the interim framework of the BCBS, by mid-November 2012. 89. The Basel Committee has issued a revised version of the Core Principles in September 2012 to reflect the lessons learned during the recent global financial crisis. In this context, it is proposed: \uf020 to carry out a self-assessment of the existing regulatory and supervisory practices based on the revised Core Principles and to initiate steps to further strengthen the regulatory and supervisory mechanism. 90. As indicated in the Monetary Policy Statement of April 2012, a Working Group (Chairman: Shri B. Mahapatra) reviewed the existing prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances by banks/financial institutions. The report of the Working Group was submitted in July and was placed on the website of the Reserve Bank inviting comments from the stakeholders. 91. The recommendations of the Working Group as also the comments/suggestions received in this regard are under examination and draft guidelines will be issued by end- January 2013. As an immediate measure, it has been decided to: \uf020 increase the provision for restructured standard accounts from the existing 2.0 per cent to 2.75 per cent. 92. Detailed guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. 93. NPAs and restructured loans of banks have been increasing significantly. A major reason for deterioration in the asset quality of banks is the lack of effective information sharing among them, despite specific instructions issued in September and December 2008 regarding sharing of information on credit, derivatives and unhedged foreign currency exposure. It is, therefore, advised that: \uf020 banks should strictly adhere to the instructions regarding sharing of information relating to credit, derivatives and unhedged foreign currency exposures among themselves and put in place an effective mechanism for information sharing by end-December 2012; \uf020 any sanction of fresh loans/ad hoc loans/renewal of loans to new/existing borrowers with effect from January 1, 2013 should be done only after obtaining/sharing necessary information; and \uf020 non-adherence to these instructions would be viewed seriously by the Reserve Bank and banks would be liable to action, including imposition of penalty, wherever considered appropriate. 94. Detailed guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. 95. Unhedged forex exposure of corporates is a source of risk to them as well as to the financing banks and the financial system. Large unhedged forex exposures have resulted in accounts becoming NPAs in some cases. Banks were, therefore, advised in February 2012 that they should rigorously evaluate the risks arising out of unhedged foreign currency exposure of the corporates and price them in the credit risk premium while extending fund- based and non fund-based credit facilities. Further, banks were also advised to consider stipulating a limit on unhedged position of corporates on the basis of banks\u2019 Board-approved policy. Despite these instructions, these risks are not being evaluated rigorously and built into pricing of credit. It is, therefore, expected that: \uf020 banks should, in accordance with the guidelines of February 2012, put in place a proper mechanism to rigorously evaluate the risks arising out of unhedged foreign currency exposure of corporates and price them in the credit risk premium, and also consider stipulating a limit on the unhedged position of corporates on the basis of banks\u2019 Board- approved policy. Banks should furnish compliance/action taken reports to the Reserve Bank before end-December 2012 after obtaining the approval of their Board of Directors. 96. Detailed guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. 97. Credit Information Companies (CICs) are an important part of the financial sector infrastructure. The success of the credit information collection and dissemination system depends on the quality and timeliness of data supplied by credit institutions to the CICs, and also extensive use of data available with CICs by credit institutions for taking decisions on loan applications. Consequent to operationalisation of the CICs (Regulation) Act, 2005 with effect from December 14, 2006 four CICs are currently operating in India. 98. It has been observed that the number of credit information reports accessed by credit institutions at the time of sanctioning loans is considerably less than the number of credit applications considered by them. This shows that credit institutions may not be furnishing accurate and timely credit data to the CICs in some cases and also are not relying as much on available credit information at the time of taking credit decisions as they should, even after taking into account the fact that records pertaining to first-time borrowers may not be available in the system. It is, therefore, expected that: \uf020 credit institutions should furnish timely and accurate credit information on their borrowers and make extensive use of available credit information as a part of their credit appraisal process. 99. Detailed guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. 100. The subprime crisis brought to the fore the importance of a cross-border resolution regime to deal with the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) which may come under stress and require resolution. In October 2011, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) proposed a set of twelve core elements, viz., the \u201cKey Attributes\u201d, as essential components for effective resolution of SIFIs. As decided by the Sub-Committee of the FSDC, a Working Group on a comprehensive resolution regime for all types of financial institutions in India has been set up with Shri Anand Sinha, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank as the Chairman and Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, as Co-Chairman. 101. The Reserve Bank has received complaints pertaining to KYC norms relating to areas such as documentary proof of identity/address, need for introduction for opening of bank accounts, and periodicity for review of KYC documents. In view of these developments, it is proposed: \uf020 to review the existing KYC norms for simplifying them within the provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act/Rules (PML Act/Rules) and international standards. In terms of extant guidelines, no advances should be granted by banks against gold 102. bullion to dealers/traders in gold if, in their assessment, such advances are likely to be utilised for purposes of financing gold purchase at auctions and/or speculative holding of stocks and bullion. In this context, the significant rise in imports of gold in recent years is a cause for concern as direct bank financing for purchase of gold in any form viz., bullion/primary gold/jewellery/gold coin could lead to fuelling of demand for gold for speculative purposes. The Monetary Policy Statement of April 2012 announced the constitution of a Working Group (Convenor: Shri K.U.B. Rao) to study issues relating to gold imports and gold loans by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in India. The Working Group submitted its draft report in August 2012. Pending a decision on its recommendations, it is proposed to advise banks that: \uf020 other than working capital finance, banks are not permitted to finance purchase of gold in any form. 103. Detailed guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. 104. Currently, domestic scheduled commercial banks (excluding RRBs) are permitted to open branches, including Regional Offices and Zonal Offices in Tier 2 to Tier 6 centres (with population up to 99,999 as per Census 2001) and in rural, semi-urban and urban centres in the North-Eastern States and Sikkim without the requirement of taking permission from the Reserve Bank in each case, subject to reporting. With a view to further increasing operational flexibility of banks, it is proposed: \uf020 to permit domestic scheduled commercial banks (other than RRBs) to open offices performing purely administrative and controlling functions (Regional Offices and Zonal Offices) in Tier 1 centres, subject to reporting. 105. Detailed guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. 106. branding arrangement, it is proposed: In order to obviate the need for banks to approach the Reserve Bank for every co- \uf020 to accord general permission to banks for issue of co-branded debit and rupee denominated pre-paid instruments, subject to certain conditions. 107. Detailed guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. 108. As proposed in the SQR of October 2011, a Working Group on pricing of credit was constituted (Chairman: Shri Anand Sinha) to look into the principles governing proper, transparent and non-discriminatory pricing of credit. The report of the Working Group is expected by end-December 2012. Supervisory Policies, Procedures and Processes 109. The High Level Steering Committee (HLSC) (Chairman: Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty) set up by the Reserve Bank to review the existing supervisory policies, procedures and processes for commercial banks in India submitted its report on June 11, 2012. The HLSC has recommended a shift in the supervisory approach from a transaction-testing based CAMELS framework to a risk based approach for early identification of risks and for enabling appropriate supervisory intervention in a timely manner. A phased approach for transition to risk based supervision (RBS) is being adopted. While 50 per cent of banks are to be covered under RBS from the next supervisory cycle beginning April 2013, the remaining banks would be covered subsequently. In line with the Committee\u2019s recommendations, banks have been advised to assess their risk management architecture, culture, practices and related processes against the essential requirements identified as prerequisites for introduction of RBS. Banks should also assess and upgrade their human resources capacity for handling risk management systems, processes and MIS to facilitate the switch over to RBS. 110. Banks\u2019 lending to the infrastructure sector has grown significantly. As a multiplicity of definitions among various regulators gives rise to confusion and difficulties, the Government of India has notified a master list of infrastructure sectors/sub-sectors in March 2012. Accordingly, it is proposed: \uf020 to harmonise the definition of infrastructure for the purpose of banks\u2019 lending with the master list notified by the Government of India. 111. Detailed guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. 112. On August 14, 2012 the Reserve Bank issued draft guidelines on management of Intra-Group Transactions and Exposures (ITEs) applicable to scheduled commercial banks. The draft guidelines contain both quantitative limits for the financial ITEs and prudential measures for non-financial ITEs to ensure that banks engage in ITEs in a safe and sound manner in order to contain concentration and contagion risk arising therefrom. These measures require banks to maintain arms-length relationships in their dealings with group entities, meet minimum requirements with respect to group risk management and group- wide oversight and adhere to prudential limits on ITEs. Comments/feedback on the draft guidelines have been sought. It is proposed: \uf020 to issue final guidelines on management of ITEs by end-January 2013. 113. Commercial banks are required to periodically place reviews on different areas of banks\u2019 operations before their Board of Directors/Management Committee/Audit Committee of the Board. These reviews are put up as per the calendar prescribed by the Reserve Bank. This calendar is reviewed by the Reserve Bank from time to time to keep it relevant to the latest developments. Accordingly, a Working Group on Rationalisation of 26 Calendar of Reviews (Chairman: Shri Deepak Singhal) has been constituted to examine and review the contents of current prescriptions in this regard. The Group is required to submit its report by end-December 2012. 114. Following the announcement in the Monetary Policy Statement of April 2012, draft guidelines for overseas investment by Core Investment Companies were placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website in May 2012. Comments received from the public are under examination and it is proposed: \uf020 to issue the final guidelines by end-November 2012. 115. The report of the Working Group on NBFCs (Chairperson: Smt. Usha Thorat) was placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website in August 2011. Based on the feedback received and further discussions held with various representatives of the sector, it has been decided: \uf020 116. Following the notification by the Central Government of the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011, the Reserve Bank has put in place a detailed regulatory framework for NBFC- Factors on July 23, 2012. NBFC-Factors shall have a minimum Net Owned Fund of `50 million for registration; factoring activity should constitute at least 75 percent of total assets; and income derived from factoring business should not be less than 75 percent of gross income. NBFC-Factors intending to deal in forex through export/import factoring will need an authorisation under FEMA, 1999 from the Reserve Bank. Automated Data Flow from Banks 117. As stated in the Monetary Policy Statement of April 2012, banks are required to implement suitable solutions to generate all their returns to be submitted to the Reserve Bank from their source systems without any manual intervention. The process is expected to be completed by end March 2013. The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring the progress of implementation. It is reiterated that banks put in place the appropriate systems to meet the objective stated within the stipulated timeline. 118. The roadmap for effecting further improvements in the payments system in the country over the next three years was laid out in the document entitled \u201cPayment Systems in India: Vision 2012-15\u201d, released on October 1, 2012 after extensive public consultations. The Vision statement articulates the key goals to be achieved. The overall policy stance is oriented towards promoting a less cash society and, in doing so, aims to reach out beyond the currently served target groups, thereby facilitating greater financial inclusion in the country. As a first step, the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) was reduced for debit cards to encourage all categories and types of merchants to deploy the card acceptance infrastructure and also facilitate acceptance of small value transactions. Disincentivising Issuance and Usage of Cheques 119. Given the still high use of cheques, any strategy to discourage the use of cheques by individuals as well as institutional users has to have a multi-pronged approach encompassing cost and time considerations, incentives for use of electronic modes of transactions and disincentives for the use of paper-based instruments. Accordingly, it has been decided to prepare a Discussion Paper on the subject by end-December 2012 and place it in the public domain for comments. Electronic Payments: National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) 120. The NEFT system, introduced in 2005, is now a retail electronic payment product of system-wide importance. Banks were recently advised to proactively assist customers in correctly filling in the required details (such as Indian financial system code (IFSC) of destination bank branch) in the NEFT application form to ensure hassle- and error-free remittances. As an additional measure aimed at improving the efficiency of the system and enhancing customer service, it has been decided to introduce with effect from November 19, 2012 an additional batch at 8.00 am in the NEFT system. This is intended to meet the growing demand and increasing volume of NEFT transactions, and to decongest the build-up of transactions in the first batch on all days including Saturdays. Implementation of an electronic GIRO system in India, viz., a payment instruction 121. from one bank account to another bank account which is initiated by the payer and not the payee, has been identified as one of the key tasks in Payment Systems in India: Vision 2012- 15. Accordingly, it is proposed to set up a Committee (Chairman: Shri G. Padmanabhan) to finalise the modalities of GIRO payments - both electronic-and cheque-based. 122. In India, different payment systems use different codes for identifying the bank/branches for routing transactions. A Technical Committee (Chairman: Shri Vijay Chugh) comprising various stakeholders has been constituted to examine the feasibility of a uniform routing code and uniform account number across banks. The Committee will submit its report by end-December 2012. Using Aadhaar for Authentication for Securing Card Present Transactions 123. One of the recommendations of the Working Group formed for securing card present transactions (Chairperson: Ms. Gowri Mukherjee) was that banks could consider the Aadhaar biometric authentication along with the MagStripe as an additional factor of authentication for card present transactions at ATMs and POS terminals. In order to take this process forward, a pilot project using Aadhaar as an additional factor of authentication for card present transactions has been scheduled to be held in Delhi from November 15, 2012. Based on the outcome of the pilot project, further steps would be taken by the Reserve Bank. Cheque Truncation System (CTS) 124. Cheque Truncation System (CTS) is an important efficiency enhancement initiative undertaken by the Reserve Bank in paper clearing, as cheques are still an important mode of payment in the country. The pan-India roll-out of CTS is envisaged to be completed by end- December 2013. This is as per the roadmap drawn-up by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which has been entrusted with the task. Currency Management 125. Pursuant to the announcements made in the Annual Monetary Policy Statement of April 2012, the CMDs of banks were sensitised to their role in currency management. They have been advised to identify four-five branches at each of the centres where the Reserve Bank\u2019s Issue offices are located. These branches would provide exchange facilities for soiled/mutilated notes as also issue coins to the general public through their dedicated counters/coin vending machines. These identified branches have to be advised to the Reserve Bank by end-October 2012. In addition, banks may also take necessary steps to streamline their systems to provide smooth and unhindered exchange facilities at other currency chests and branches across the country. 126. In May 2012, banks were advised to re-align their cash management to ensure that cash receipts in denominations of `100 and above are not put into re-circulation without being machine-processed for authenticity. Banks have the option of either providing machines to their branches or ensuring that branches which do not have the machines are supplied only machine-processed notes for distribution among the public. 127. It is observed, however, that reporting of detection of counterfeit notes has not improved on the expected lines. It needs to be emphasised that although 90 per cent of the currency chests are with the public sector banks, they account for reporting a mere 10 per cent of counterfeit notes, while private sector banks with less than 10 per cent of currency chests are reporting 90 per cent of such cases. A review on the status of implementation of the Reserve Bank\u2019s instructions issued in May 2012 will be made in the first week of November 2012. It is reiterated that wherever counterfeit notes are detected but not impounded and reported, it will be construed as wilful involvement of the bank concerned in circulating counterfeit notes and may attract penal measures. 128. The High Level Committee constituted by the Government of India (Chairman: Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty) to examine the growing demand for coins submitted its report on August 14, 2012. Some of the major recommendations include the need for the Reserve Bank to focus exclusively on management and planning of the currency system, while the responsibility for distribution of coins and notes among individuals and institutions should be entirely with banks, subject to compliance with Sections 38 and 39 of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The Committee has also recommended that if the last mile connectivity for distributing coins/small notes has to be achieved, there is a need to introduce alternative avenues for distribution of small notes and coins on behalf of banks. Banks may, therefore, be encouraged to explore the possibility of introducing the franchisee model. 129. Furthermore, each bank may be allotted certain areas (districts/States) on the lines of the Lead Bank Scheme/Service Area Approach for priority sector lending for ensuring that the area is supplied with coins and clean notes in coordination with other currency chests and small coin depots in that area. Additional storage points or underground silos can be created in the space available in mints which can be used as counter- cyclical buffers - they will store/absorb coins during surplus years and release them during shortages. ", "file6": "Growth since Q4 of 2012-13 is expected to 1. stage a gradual recovery aided by some revival in investment demand and the favourable effect of some moderation in inflation on consumption. Inflation in Q3 of 2012-13 has trended down, though upside risks remain from suppressed inflation which could impart stickiness to inflation trajectory in 2013- 14. Core inflation pressures have receded markedly and are unlikely to re-emerge quickly on demand considerations. However, high food and fuel inflation still remain a concern and this in part is reflected in high CPI inflation. immediate risk of the fiscal cliff in the US has been averted due to a hurried deal on tax rate hikes, the debt ceiling limit and the sequester issue pertaining to expenditure reduction are still unsettled. Growth in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) may have bottomed out, but an enduring recovery hinges on global headwinds. Global commodity price inflation likely to remain soft, although with some risks from QE Since the beginning of 2012, the Reserve 2. Bank has worked towards easing monetary and liquidity conditions in a calibrated manner so as to not jeopardise the trend of moderating inflation. The strategy yielded dividends, as headline and core inflation moderated during Q3 of 2012-13. However, monetary policy needs to continue to be calibrated in addressing growth risks as inflation remains above level the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort and macroeconomic risks from twin deficits persists. 4. Inflation in AEs is likely to remain moderate as demand remains weak, leaving the global inflation scenario benign in the near term. As a baseline case, improved supply prospects in key commodities such as oil and food are also likely to restrain commodity price pressures. However, upside risks persist, especially on the back of some recovery in EMDEs and large quantitative easing (QE) by AE central banks. In the presence of significant excess global liquidity, triggers for supply disruptions or incremental news flow on reduced slack could exacerbate price volatility and become a source of inflationary pressure. Unconventional monetary policies reduce global financial stress in the interim, but risks remain ahead 4.

Unconventional monetary policies reduce global financial stress in the interim, but risks remain ahead 3. Though the US registered high growth in Q3 of 2012 and the pace of economic contraction moderated in the euro area, growth prospects for advanced economies (AEs) in 2013 remain subdued. While the International financial market stress 5. moderated greatly following aggressive monetary easing measures by the central banks of AEs, as also recent policy initiatives on fiscal consolidation in the euro area economies, encouraging capital flows into EMDEs. However, in the absence of credible long-term fiscal consolidation in the US, and generally reduced fiscal space in AEs, the efficacy of monetary policy actions may get subdued. Risks to the global financial sector, although moderating, are likely to persist. under control and protecting, if not enhancing capital expenditure. Going forward, the key to demand revival lies in improving the investment climate as well as investor sentiments through sustained reforms. Growth remains below trend, recovery likely in 2013-14 The Indian economy further decelerated in 6. the first half (H1) of 2012-13, with moderation in all three sectors of the economy. The weak monsoon dented agricultural performance. Policy constraints, supply and infrastructure bottlenecks and lack of sufficient demand continued to keep industrial growth below trend. Subdued growth in other sectors and weak external demand pulled down the growth of services as well. Though a modest recovery may set in from Q4 of 2012-13 as reforms get through implemented, sustaining recovery 2013-14 would require all-round efforts in removing impediments to business activity. Widening of CAD and its financing remains a key policy challenge 8. The current account deficit (CAD) to GDP ratio reached a historically high level of 5.4 per cent in Q2 of 2012-13. Low growth and uncertainty in AEs as well as EMDEs continued to adversely impact exports in Q3 of 2012-13. This, combined with continuing large imports of oil and gold, resulted in a deterioration of the trade balance. For the time being, strong capital flows have enabled financing of CAD without a significant drawdown of foreign exchange reserves. However, the possibility of volatility in these flows, which may put further pressure on the external sector, cannot be ruled out. A two-pronged approach, of lowering CAD in the medium term while ensuring prudent financing of CAD in the interim, is necessary from the policy perspective. With tightening cycle gradually impacting inflation, the Reserve Bank takes measures to combat tight liquidity conditions Improvement in investment climate is a pre-requisite for economic recovery Demand weakened in H1 of 2012-13. There 7. was significant moderation in consumption as private consumption decelerated even as government expenditure accelerated. On the fiscal side, near-term risks have diminished due to the government\u2019s repeated avowal of commitment to the revised fiscal deficit target of 5.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the year. However, sustainable fiscal consolidation would require bringing current spending, especially on subsidies, 9. Monetary policy in India has sought to balance the growth-inflation dynamics that included a frontloaded policy rate cut of 50 basis points (bps) in April 2012 and several liquidity enhancing measures. These included lowering of the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 bps on top of a 125 bps reduction in Q4 of 2011-12 and the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) by 100 bps in a bid to improve credit flows. The Reserve Bank also infused liquidity of over `1.3 trillion through outright open market operation (OMO) purchases during 2012-13 so far. However, growth in monetary aggregates remains below the indicative trajectory. Domestic reform initiatives and surging capital flows improve market sentiment and revive the IPO market Improved global sentiments along with 10. recent policy reforms by the government beginning September 2012, and market expectations of a cut in the policy rate in the face of moderation in inflation, aided FII flows into the domestic market. The equity markets showed significant turnaround, while the rupee remained range-bound. In addition, revival is witnessed in the IPO segment. Although Indian financial market sentiments improved significantly in Q3 of 2012-13, some macroeconomic concerns persist, as witnessed in the inverted yield curve. Sustained commitment to curtail twin deficits and nurture growth without fuelling inflation is critical to support investor confidence. Headline and core inflation moderated, but suppressed inflation poses risks Headline inflation moderated in Q3 of 11. 2012-13 with significant moderation in non- food manufactured products inflation. Both weakening domestic demand and lower global commodity prices contributed to the softening of headline inflation. Though the recent hike in diesel prices will put some pressure on the overall price level, the near-term inflation outlook indicates that the moderation may continue through Q4 of 2012-13. While the pressure from generalised inflation remains muted at the current juncture, risks from suppressed inflation, pressure on food prices inflation expectations getting and high entrenched into the wage-price spiral need to be reckoned with. The inflation path for 2013- 14 could face downward rigidity as some of the risks from suppressed inflation materialise. Balance of macroeconomic risks suggest continuation of calibrated stance 12. Reforms since September 2012 have reduced immediate risks, but there is a long road ahead to bring about a sustainable turnaround for the Indian economy. Business sentiments remain weak despite reform is initiatives and consumer confidence edging down. The Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of professional forecasters anticipates a slow recovery in 2013-14 with inflation remaining sticky. Fiscal risks have somewhat moderated in 2012-13, but a sustained commitment to fiscal consolidation is needed to generate monetary space. Widening CAD, which is at historically high level, remains a constraint on monetary easing. Against this backdrop, while growth can be supported by monetary policy inflation risks recede, credible fiscal correction with improved execution in infrastructure space to boost investment would be needed for a sustained revival. The balance of macroeconomic risks suggest continuation of the calibrated stance while increasingly focussing on growth risks. if India\u2019s growth slipped to 5.3 per cent in Q2 of 2012-13 from 5.5 per cent in Q1. Agricultural growth in 2012-13 is likely to be below trend as the rabi crop is unlikely to fully compensate for the kharif deficiency. Industrial growth is expected to stay below its trend due to supply and infrastructure bottlenecks and slack in external demand. Growth in the services sector has decelerated due to lackadaisical conditions in commodity-producing sectors and some of its own drivers faltering. Consequent to these factors, growth in 2012-13 may fall below the Reserve Bank\u2019s October 2012 projection of 5.8 per cent. Even though a modest recovery may set in from Q4 of 2012-13 as reforms and efforts to remove structural constraints get underway, sustaining this recovery through 2013-14 would require all-round efforts in removing impediments for business activity. With global recovery likely to stay muted in the near term, closing the output gap in India would be challenging. Fiscal adjustments likely to keep global recovery muted in 2013 There was a mild improvement in I.1 macroeconomic advanced conditions economies (AEs) in Q3 of 2012. However, the sustainability of this improvement through 2013 remains uncertain in view of the fiscal adjustment agenda facing most AEs. I.2 the US economy expanded significantly by 3.1 per cent (q-o-q annualised) in Q3 of 2012, growth in Q4 is expected to be lower than in Q3. The pace of contraction in the euro area slowed from 0.7 per cent in Q2 to 0.3 per cent in Q3 of 2012 (Chart I.1). Spain, Italy and Portugal continued to be in recession, while GDP contracted in the Netherlands. The euro area\u2019s composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for December 2012 suggests that recession continues in the region. German economy, the largest in the region, is estimated to have contracted in Q4 of 2012. I.3 Labour markets in AEs exhibited a mixed picture in Q4 of 2012. The unemployment rate in the US remained steady at about 7.8 per cent in December 2012 after improvements seen in the preceding quarter. In the UK, the unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage points to 7.7 per cent for the period September- November 2012. However, in the euro area the unemployment rate reached a new high of 11.8 2 4 6 8 per cent in November 2012. The unemployment rate in Spain and Greece exceeds 26 per cent, with youth unemployment rates of about 57 per cent. Such levels clearly impart a socio- economic constraint to fiscal consolidation to support adjustment and programmes stabilisation in the euro area. As such, risks to global growth emanating from euro area remain significant. I.4 in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) turned weaker during Q3 of 2012. However, there are signs of a modest improvement in Q4. China registered its first acceleration in growth in two years in y-o-y terms in Q4 of 2012. Brazil\u2019s PMI also showed a marked improvement in November and December 2012. The readings indicate that growth may have bottomed out. I.7 remain heightened about economic fundamentals and policy adjustment in the euro area. In Japan, though the government has announced further fiscal stimulus of US$116 billion to ride the economy out of recession, concerns remain about the level of public debt. I.8 In the EMDEs, the short-term growth recovery hinges upon the extent to which the external risks relating to escalation of uncertainties in the euro area crisis and the possibility of bumpy fiscal adjustment in the US are averted. Against the backdrop of uncertain growth prospects and generally low and stable inflation, central banks in many EMDEs held or reduced policy rates to low levels in 2012. The need and scope for monetary policy action, however, differs across economies, mainly reflecting varying growth and inflation risks, and risks to financial stability from past stimuli. I.5 Despite signs of improvement in activity in recent months, prospects for recovery in 2013 remain highly uncertain. International agencies have sequentially scaled down their forecasts for growth in 2013 (Chart I.2). The patchy deal on fiscal cliff in the US, I.6 through enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, has lowered the immediate risks. However, the deal is still likely to have some adverse effect on the US recovery in 2013. Under \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, the fiscal cliff was estimated to hike revenues close to 20 per cent and also lower spending a little. The deal has substantially reduced the tax side of the cliff but not eliminated it. The budget sequestration on the spending side will still have an impact if not negotiated before the automatic spending cuts take effect on March 1, 2013. Overall, the deal may still result in a deficit reduction of about a third of the original estimate. Also, even though the US is on its way to temporarily suspend the requirement for the Congress to approve a higher debt ceiling as the US$16.4 trillion borrowing limit is reached, concerns about long term debt sustainability remain. Growth slowdown in India continues, revival may take some more time I.9 Growth in India continued to be subdued at 5.3 per cent in Q2 of 2012-13 and is likely to remain low in Q3 as well. The slowdown reflects the uncertain global macro-economic environment as well as domestic factors such as low growth in real investment (gross fixed capital formation) and a weak south-west monsoon. Consequently, growth in the first half (H1) of 2012-13 was 5.4 per cent and r e b m e c e D below trend, compared with growth of 7.3 per cent in H1 of 2011-12 (Chart I.3). I.10 Looking ahead, even as inflation is moderating and growth is likely to have bottomed out, the Reserve Bank\u2019s growth projection of 5.8 per cent for 2012-13 could face downside risks. This is largely because the positive impact of the various policy measures announced by the government is yet to show up fully or definitively in the various data releases, partly reflecting inherent gestation lags of the policy initiatives and partly the persistence of structural supply bottlenecks. Moreover, real fixed investment has been trending down since peaking in Q1 of 2005-06 (Chart I.4). Agriculture and industry further drag down growth in Q2 of 2012-13 sectors, the Planning Commission has scaled down the average annual growth target of the economy to 8.0 per cent (8.2 per cent earlier) during the Twelfth Five Year Plan. Growth during the previous Plan period was 7.9 per cent. Overall, the growth rate is projected to progressively increase to 9.0 per cent by 2016- 17, the terminal year of the Twelfth Plan. This is arduous as a quick revival appears difficult with slack in global demand and serious structural issues that need to be addressed. Total investment in the infrastructure sector during the period is estimated at `56.3 trillion (about US$1 trillion). The attainment of this target is contingent on increasing the share of private investment in total investment in infrastructure from 38 per cent in the previous Plan to about 48 per cent during the Twelfth Plan. The deceleration in growth in H1 of 2012- I.11 13 was seen across all the major sectors. The agriculture sector was adversely impacted due to the weak south-west monsoon. Industrial slowdown was on account of moderation in manufacturing and \u2018electricity, gas and water supply\u2019. The dip in services sector growth was mainly on account of \u2018trade, hotels, transport, storage and communication\u2019, even as the other sub-sectors showed improvement (Table I.1). 5 10 Rabi crop expected to be normal despite deficient rains rainfall during I.13 recovery of August-September helped maintain soil moisture. Even though the north-east monsoon continued to be below normal (by 21 per cent as on December 31, 2012) sowing of rabi crops has not been affected as the water level in major reservoirs is satisfactory. Sowing under major rabi crops so far in the year is comparable with the level in the previous year (Table I.2). The high stock of foodgrains indicates I.14 that the country is currently self-sufficient in wheat and rice (Chart I.5). In recent months, however, cereal prices, particularly of wheat and rice, have remained elevated. Weakness in industrial performance likely to persist Industrial growth has remained subdued I.15 since July 2011 due to weak global demand, weak supply linkages, high input costs and sluggish investment activity.

I.16 The manufacturing sector witnessed sharp moderation in growth during April- November 2012. Within the manufacturing sector, capital goods industries such as machinery and equipment, electrical machinery and computing machinery registered a contraction in output. The slowdown in consumption demand has affected the growth of motor vehicles, food products and apparel industries. I.17 Lack of reliable power supply has emerged as a challenge in capacity utilisation of small- and medium-scale industries. Electricity generation decelerated sharply during April- November 2012 due to a weak monsoon and shortages in coal supply. Capacity utilisation or plant load factor (PLF) of thermal power plants was 69.6 per cent during April-December 2012, compared with 71.9 per cent during the same period in the previous year. Shortage of coal is one of the main reasons for lower PLF in the current year.

There is strong co-movement between domestic and global IIP, the correlation coefficient between the two during April 2008 to November 2012 was 0.7. Recovery of core industries yet to pick up momentum I.19 infrastructure in eight core industries decelerated to 3.5 per cent during April-November 2012 compared to 4.8 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year. While the production of coal, cement and petroleum refinery products accelerated during the period, it was offset by the deceleration in the production of electricity and steel (Chart I.7). government for the allocation of new coal blocks and commencement of production from CIL\u2019s new coalfields are expected to boost coal output going forward. However, in the interim, constraints in infrastructure sector remain (see Chapter 2). I.21 Capacity utilisation as measured by the 19th round of the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank increased marginally in Q2 of 2012-13 after bottoming out during the previous quarter (http://www. rbi.org.in/OBICUS19). There is a broad co- movement between capacity utilisation and de-trended IIP manufacturing (Chart I.8).

The moderation of services sector I.22 growth in H1 of 2012-13 was largely due to the sharp deceleration in the growth of the \u2018trade, hotels, transport, storage and communication\u2019. Slowdown in services associated with trading activity reflects the sluggish domestic industrial scenario. Y-o-y growth in GDP services excluding community, social and personal services (right scale) Services Sector Composite Indicator t c O The telecom industry in India has I.23 witnessed significant moderation in growth in the recent period due to increased saturation and regulatory uncertainties. Heightened competition has led to aggressive pricing which has reduced the average revenue per user to one of the lowest in the world. Stagnating revenues from voice services imply that business would now be largely driven by wireless data services. At the same time, for continued growth of the telecom sector it is critical to establish appropriate mechanisms to achieve a balance between competition and consolidation to benefit both the users and the providers of telecommunication services. I.24 Going forward, various indicators of the services sector activity as also the Reserve Bank\u2019s services sector composite indicator point towards weakening of growth (Table I.4 and Chart I.9). There has been significant deceleration in automobile sales and railway freight earnings during November-December 2012. The pace of foreign tourist arrivals has been slack through 2012-13 and cargo handled at ports contracted significantly during November-December 2012. Services exports too are likely to remain low given the uncertain outlook for global growth. 1 Tourist arrivals Cement Steel Automobile sales Railway revenue earning freight traffic Cargo handled at major ports Civil aviation Domestic cargo traffic Domestic passenger traffic International cargo traffic International passenger traffic Financial Services Indicator Aggregate Deposit Non-food Credit *: Data refers to Apr-Oct. #: Data refers to Apr-Nov.

However, there were gains in employment in recent years. As per the latest Annual Survey of Industries, organised industrial sector employment increased by 7.8 per cent in 2010- 11 while wage per worker rose by 14.8 per cent. There was a significant increase in both employment and wages in the second half of the decade 2001-10 (Table I.5). to persist I.26 kharif, overall growth in agricultural and allied activities during 2012-13 may remain positive. Foodgrain and non-foodgrain crops account for about a third of this output, with horticulture and livestock accounting for about half and forestry and fishing the rest. I.28 covery is likely to shape up in 2013-14 with progressive implementation of some of the reforms announced since mid- September 2012. These include, inter alia, liberalisation of FDI in multi-brand retail, amendment of the Banking Regulation Act and the setting up of the Cabinet Committee on Investments chaired by the Prime Minister to expedite decisions on approvals/clearances for implementation of mega projects. The setting up of debt funds to provide long-term resources for infrastructure projects would help in reducing financing constraints currently facing the sector. Financing is also expected to improve with the government accepting the major recommendations of the Expert Committee on General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR) that will bring about greater clarity on taxation aspects. I.27 still remaining sluggish, growth is likely to remain below trend during H2 of 2012-13. Weak industrial growth and unfavourable global economic conditions pull down the momentum in the services sector, which accounts for about two-third of GDP. However, the construction sub-sector has generally been robust thus far, and is likely to improve further with the ending of the monsoon season. I.29 temporarily reduced in terms of part resolution of the US \u2018fiscal cliff\u2019 issues and financial fragility issues in the euro area. However, going forward the euro area risks remain significant, as key economies in the region are contracting. In this milieu, it is imperative that reform measures continue to be executed efficiently and domestic inflation recedes further, to support sustainable recovery in India. Global risks may have Demand conditions in the economy remained tepid during Q2 of 2012-13. Private consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand, continued to decelerate, reflecting the impact of high inflation. However, government consumption accelerated during the first half of the year. The envisaged fiscal correction now underway is expected to improve demand management. Steps to contain subsidies need to be persisted with and expedited so that fiscal imbalance is reduced and resources are freed to step up capital expenditure next year. There was a marginal sequential rise in investment in Q2 of 2012-13, as reflected in a modest increase in gross fixed capital formation as also the sanctioned project assistance during the quarter. A turnaround in the investment cycle, which has been in downturn for two years, crucially hinges on increased public investment to crowd in private investment and resolution of power and road sector bottlenecks. Expenditure side of GDP continued to show weak demand II.1 in GDP at market prices decelerated sharply to 2.8 per cent in Q2 of 2012-13 from 6.9 per cent in the corresponding period of 2011-12, the lowest in the previous 13 quarters (Table II.1). Though private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) continues to be the major driver of growth, its contribution to growth has declined since Q4 of 2011-12 (Table II.2). consumption. The announced efforts towards restrain fiscal consolidation could also government final consumption somewhat. More definitive indication of a pick-up in gross fixed capital formation is yet to be seen. On the whole, the growth process during 2012-13 would be largely driven by private consumption. Problems facing infrastructure sector still constraining investment II.2 During H1 of 2012-13, growth in GDP at market prices was significantly lower than that at factor cost due to lower growth in net indirect taxes. The deceleration was reflected in all components except government final consumption expenditure (GFCE). Growth in private consumption moderated due to high inflation coupled with lower income growth during 2012-13 so far. Net exports growth continued to be negative partly due to weak external demand. This is in line with the record current account deficit observed during Q2 of 2012-13. Going forward, possible moderation inflation would support private final As on November 1, 2012, out of 563 II.4 central sector projects (of `1.5 billion and above), largely concentrated in five sectors, viz., road transport and highways, power, petroleum, railways and coal, nearly half were reported to be delayed. As a result, there were significant cost overruns in many of these projects. The major factors reported for the time overruns were delays in land acquisitions/ environmental clearances/tie-up of project financing/finalising of engineering designs, lack of infrastructure support and linkages, change in scope and other contractual issues. The maximum number of delays was reported for two key infrastructure sectors \u2013 power, and road transport and highways.

On the coal linkage issue, while power producers have started signing new fuel supply agreement with Coal India Limited that commits supply of 65 per cent of the assured coal quantity through domestic sources and another 15 per cent in the form of imported coal, the key issue of price pooling remains unresolved.

The state governments and their state electricity boards need to quickly commit themselves to the restructuring of their debt with all attendant requirements. II.6 In the road sector, the record tendering by the National Highways Authority of India awarding 6,491 kilometres of road projects in 2011-12 has not helped in reversing the declining investment in this sector as a very large number of these projects have not achieved environmental clearances. Some projects are also stuck due to land acquisition issues. In addition, firms engaged in these projects are finding it difficult to achieve financial closure. Investment in road sector has collapsed in 2012-13, with scant interest in new projects, large delays and poor execution in existing projects. Even the projects being awarded on engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) basis, where the state bears the cost, are making little headway. This is because the new legal framework necessitates upfront environmental clearances for even small stretches of land, before private contractors execute the project. Sales growth moderates further, indicating slack demand Sales growth for listed non-government II.7 non-financial (NGNF) companies moderated and reached its lowest level in three years in Q2 of 2012-13 (Table II.3). The deceleration in sales was spread across manufacturing, IT and non-IT services sectors, all size groups and all use-based groups, except intermediate groups, with sharper deceleration in motor vehicles, iron and steel, and textiles. However, net profits recorded a growth of more than 25 per cent in Q2 of 2012-13 reversing the declining trend of the previous four quarters. The growth in profits was on a low base and reflected support from other income and lower rate of growth in interest payments. Resultantly, profit margins also improved during the quarter (Table II.4). the Inventory accumulation, reflected Change in stock # to Sales Interest Burden EBITDA to Sales EBIT to Sales Net Profit to Sales #: For companies reporting this item explicitly. *: Other income excludes extraordinary income/expenditure if reported explicitly 4.7 -4.1 -5.4 5.6 6.6 -7.4 -23.3 -3.0 -12.1 8.1 -1.9 -17.4 change in stock-to-sales ratio, went up during the quarter but remained below the recent peak observed in Q3 of 2011-12 (Chart II.1). II.8 Early results of 166 companies for Q3 of 2012-13 indicate continued moderation in sales. Expenditure growth also decelerated further and profit margins remained almost intact. However, the early results are from a small set of companies which are not representative of the overall corporate sector. II.9 Based on data received from 39 banks/ financial institutions as also on financing from external commercial borrowings (ECB) and foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCB), there was a small increase in the total cost of projects sanctioned in Q2 of 2012-13. However, the amount of sanctioned assistance was much lower than during the corresponding quarter of the previous year (Chart II.2). Fresh policy measures helping fiscal consolidation II.10 the government announced a revised fiscal roadmap following the the Report of the Committee on Roadmap for Fiscal Consolidation (Chairman: Dr. Vijay L. Kelkar). As per the revised roadmap, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) for 2012-13 is estimated at 5.3 r e p n i h t w o r g y - o - Y r e p n i o i t a R Note: Capex figures include data reported by 39 banks and financial institutions.

The government\u2019s fiscal consolidation plan envisages fiscal deficit to decline to 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2013-14 and by 0.6 percentage points every year thereafter to reach 3.0 per cent of GDP in 2016-17. by monetising government\u2019s unutilised and under-utilised land resources. These resources could be used to finance infrastructure needs particularly in urban areas. Such innovative measures would need to be examined though, as such asset sales do not support a structural correction in the fiscal position II.11 The government has taken several steps to curtail deficit and put government finances on a more sustainable path. In a significant move, in January 2013, the government partially deregulated the prices of diesel, allowing full adjustment of prices for bulk consumers and a staggered increase for others. On the other hand, the annual supply of subsidised LPG cylinders per household has been increased to nine, from the cap of six announced in September 2012. These measures on the whole constitute an important signal to address fiscal imbalances, though its impact in the current fiscal year is expected to be negligible. II.12 Renewed thrust to disinvestment of public sector undertakings so as to meet the budgetary target, cut-back in both plan and non-plan expenditure and increased reliance on direct cash transfers to cut leakages in subsidies also constitute important steps in reducing fiscal deficit. The government has, however, committed to retaining allocations to all flagship schemes to protect the poor. On tax reforms, it has committed to introducing the goods and services tax (GST) and reviewing the Direct Tax Code (DTC). More recently, the government has reiterated its stance of restricting expenditure in the last quarter of the financial year to 33 per cent of the budget estimates, and that during March to 15 per cent, to curb the bunching of expenditure towards the close of the financial year. II.13 Further fiscal consolidation measures would be necessary in near term. The Kelkar committee has recommended several steps in this direction. For instance, over the next two to three years, resources could be raised Fiscal deficit remains high as slowdown impacts revenues II.14 During the first eight months of the current year, the fiscal deficit amounted to 4.1 per cent of GDP or 80.4 per cent of the budget estimates (Table II.5). Revenue deficit, at 3.1 per cent of GDP, was marginally lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year. Given the current trends, significant shortfall in tax revenues and some shortfall in budgeted spectrum receipts likely. Realisation of budgeted disinvestment proceeds crucially hinges on market conditions. However, the government is working to achieve the revised fiscal deficit target of 5.3 per cent with containment of both plan and non-plan expenditure during the last quarter of the year. is Growth slowdown remains a drag on revenue collections Revenue collections remained sluggish II.15 at 47.6 per cent of budget estimates during April-November 2012 (49.7 per cent in the previous year). The growth in collection of corporation tax and excise duties remained modest due to continued growth moderation, while customs duty collections were adversely impacted, reflecting in imports. Collections under personal income tax, however, remained buoyant partly due to lower refunds compared to previous year. Non-tax revenue receipts, at 46.3 per cent of budget estimates, were also significantly lower than the receipts of 57.7 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year due to the poor response to spectrum 1.

Non-plan expenditure continues to exert pressure despite a moderation in total expenditure Quality of fiscal adjustment remains a concern II.16 During April-November 2012, the total expenditure of the government was lower at 58.2 per cent of the budget estimates (60.5 per cent in the previous year). The deceleration in expenditure has been more pronounced since September 2012, with a narrowing down in the differential between the current year\u2019s expenditure (as per cent of budget estimate) and the respective three-year average (as per cent to actual), indicating the government\u2019s efforts to rein in expenditure (Chart II.3). 1 3 5 7 9 : Difference between the current year's revenue receipts/total expendiure (aspercentofbudgetestimate)andtherespectiveprevious3-yearaverage (as percentofactuals). compromise the quality of fiscal adjustment. During April-November 2012, plan expenditure and capital expenditure as percentages to budget estimates were significantly lower than those in the preceding year. Plan expenditure as a percentage of budget estimate was lower for major departments/ministries such as power, road transport and highways, rural development and women and child development. Lower public investment in crucial infrastructure would have implications for growth. While the quality of expenditure remains an area of concern, fiscal augmentation through increased recourse to disinvestment proceeds and one- off receipts such as spectrum auctions may not be sustainable. Additional market borrowing likely to be averted this year, but further steps needed II.19 The government announced the first supplementary demand for grant, which entails a net cash outgo of `308 billion mainly to provide part compensation for estimated under- recoveries to oil marketing companies (`285 billion) and infusion of equity in Air India (`20 billion). This additional expenditure may not entail any additional market borrowings. However, the subsidy provision made so far appears inadequate. Reviving investment demand is the key to economic turnaround The government has made a commitment II.20 to bring down the level of the fiscal deficit. However, if the compression in government expenditure is mainly from plan/capital heads, it raises concerns relating to quality of the fiscal consolidation. As the reforms announced by the government take effect, the improvement in investment climate would help in reviving growth. Increased public investment to crowd- in private investment along with removal of structural impediments slowing private investment is needed to pull the economy out of the current slowdown. The CAD\u2013GDP ratio reached a historic high of 5.4 per cent in Q2 of 2012-13, heightening concerns about the sustainability and financing of CAD. Worsening trade deficit and slower growth in services exports were the major factors behind the sharp rise in CAD. Weak external demand, which affected merchandise exports adversely, combined with continuing high imports of POL and gold, resulted in deterioration of the trade balance in Q3 of 2012-13. Despite the policy initiatives taken by the government, export revival is contingent on economic recovery in advanced economies as well as EMDEs. Even though capital flows have been sufficient to finance CAD for the time being, the volatility therein can put pressure on the external sector. Clearly, it is imperative to lower the CAD, while ensuring in the interim its prudent financing. Weak external demand continues to affect merchandise exports adversely India\u2019s export performance continued III.1 to show the adverse impact of low growth and uncertainty in the advanced as well as major Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs). The downturn in the global manufacturing cycle in both advanced economies and EMDEs has impacted the overall world trade volume, which is also reflected in negative export growth of major EMDEs, including India, Brazil, Russia, South Africa and Indonesia (Chart III.1). Even though the export growth of China remains positive, it has also decelerated in the recent period. Despite policy actions, revival of export growth remains uncertain India\u2019s subdued exports performance, III.2 which began in H2 of 2011-12, showed further deterioration during 2012-13 so far. Since the outlook for global growth remains weak, it is unlikely that exports will reach even the previous year\u2019s level. Commodity- wise data show that growth in exports of engineering goods, petroleum products, textile products, gems & jewellery and chemicals & related products was severely affected because demand conditions in key markets such as the US and Europe continued to remain sluggish. Demand from new export destinations explored under diversification efforts also weakened. For instance, apart from export growth to developed countries, export growth to developing countries has also either decelerated or declined in recent quarters (Chart III.2). During April-November 2012, EU accounted for 27.4 per cent of total decline in merchandise exports, followed by Singapore (21.0 per cent), China (20.7 per cent), Hong Kong (4.8 per cent) and Indonesia (4.6 per cent). Lower growth in export-oriented Asian economies caused by setbacks to global recovery has clearly weighed on India\u2019s external demand from these economies. III.3 In view of the lacklustre performance of the exports sector, the government announced export promotion measures on December 26, 2012. These include (i) the extension of the interest subvention scheme for select r e p n i h t w o r g y - o - y 20 40 60 Continued high imports of POL and gold may widen India\u2019s trade deficit further r e p n i h t w o r g y - o - y 10 20 III.4 since September 2012, mainly due to a pick-up in the quantum of POL (Chart III.3). With the uptrend in the international price of gold in recent months, gold imports stayed at an elevated level in recent months. On the other hand, non-oil non-gold imports registered a decline, reflecting a slowdown in domestic economic activity. Import growth has surged employment-oriented sectors up to end-March 2014, (ii) the introduction of a pilot scheme of 2 per cent interest subvention for project exports through EXIM Bank for countries of the SAARC region, Africa and Myanmar, (iii) broadening the scope of the Focus Market Scheme, Special Focus Market Scheme and Market-Linked Focus Product Scheme and (iv) incentives for incremental exports to the US, EU and countries of Asia during the period January\u2013March 2013 over the base period. To enhance the flow of credit to the export sector, the Reserve Bank introduced a US dollar-rupee swap facility for scheduled banks to support incremental Pre-shipment Export Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC) by banks on January 14, 2013. Despite these measures, quick recovery in exports to major trading partners may not take place unless III.5 With imports growth turning positive from September 2012 and exports growth remaining subdued, concerns regarding a deteriorating trade deficit have been reinforced. During April\u2013December 2012, the trade deficit was 7.2 per cent higher than that in April\u2013 December 2011 (Table III.1). Going forward, apart from global and domestic growth conditions, the trend in POL and gold imports will be critical determinants of India\u2019s overall trade deficit. been to deftly III.6 balance the genuine interests of the gold business, as also the need of the savers to hedge against inflation, against the overwhelming need to dampen gold imports with a view to preserving current account and macro-financial Policy attempt so far has 25.0 r e p n i h t w o r g y - o - y 10.0 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 n o i l l i b $ S U n o i l l i b $ S U 20.0 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A l e r r a b r e p $ S U 118.6 183.4 137.3 147.2 64.5 98.9 68.7 85.4 54.1 84.4 68.6 61.8 19.7 34.8 31.9 28.7 7.0 10.0 10.1 11.7 stability. The gold demand in recent years has also picked up for speculative purposes. Against this backdrop, the Reserve Bank had constituted a Working Group to Study the Issues Related to Gold and Gold Loans by NBFCs in India (Chairman: Shri K.U.B. Rao). The Group, in its report, noted that high gold imports have implications for external sector vulnerability. The Group has recommended like measures introduction of new gold-backed financial products, supply management measures such as channelising the existing supply of scrap gold, and the introduction of tax incentives on gold-related instruments as well as steps to increase the monetisation of gold. The Reserve Bank placed the report of the Group on its website on January 2, 2013 for comments from stakeholders and the public. to contain gold demand III.7 Besides enhancing the customs duty from 4 per cent to 6 per cent on gold imports, the government has proposed to unfreeze or release a part of the gold physically held by mutual funds under Gold ETFs and enable them to deposit the gold with banks under the Gold Deposit Scheme. The minimum quantity as well as minimum tenure of gold deposits (from 3 years to 6 months) have been reduced. Concerns about sustainability of CAD heighten as the CAD\u2013GDP ratio reaches a historic high in Q2 of 2012-13 III.8 India\u2019s current account deficit (CAD) increased further in Q2 of 2012-13 mainly due to the worsening trade deficit, decelerated growth in net export of services and higher outflows under primary income (Table III.2). The CAD\u2013GDP ratio at 5.4 per cent is not only unsustainable, but is also the highest-ever peak level. Early indications are that in Q3 of 2012- 13, CAD as a percentage of GDP may increase further from this peak. Subdued growth conditions in major advanced economies seem to have impacted growth in India\u2019s export of software services in recent quarters. However, results of major IT firms for Q3 of 2012-13 suggest some improvement in their dollar revenues. Even though global IT spending is projected to increase by 4.2 per cent in 2013, 1 1.

Unless global economic and trade conditions improve significantly and boost India\u2019s export of goods and services, the high CAD may continue to be challenging. Strong capital flows facilitate financing of CAD III.9 ics shows that improved capital flows were about adequate to finance an expanding CAD during Q2 of 2012-13, as evident from only a marginal drawdown of foreign exchange reserves (Table III.3). III.10 While net inflows under FDI moderated somewhat during April-November 2012, net inflows by foreign institutional investors (FII) have shown a significant uptrend. Net FII inflows during 2012-13 (up to January 18) at US$ 18.8 billion were significantly higher than during the corresponding period of the previous year (US$ 7.6 billion), thus providing temporary comfort for financing of CAD (Table III.4). s improved global liquidity and III.11 sentiment, robust FII inflows were largely the outcome of improved perception about the domestic economy, driven by recent reforms announced by the government since September 2012. These reforms include, inter alia, liberalised FDI norms for the retail, insurance and pension sectors, a roadmap for fiscal consolidation and an increase in FII limits in the corporate and government debt markets. The FII investment limits in government securities and corporate bonds were raised by US$ 5 billion each, taking the total investment limit in domestic debt (including corporate debt for infrastructure) to US$ 75 billion. While the increased limit may enhance debt inflows, they do not provide a solution to CAD financing on a sustainable basis.

On the other hand, a range-bound currency after a bout of depreciation has made the Indian equity market attractive for FIIs. Going forward, the implementation and acceleration in domestic reforms would be critical for sustained equity flows to the economy. Though the risk aversion in global markets declined during the previous quarter, the flows could be volatile given the euro area risks. 0.5 0.6 0.3 III.13 interest rates and a weakening rupee, non-resident Indians (NRIs) nearly doubled their deposits with banks in India during April\u2013November 2012 compared with the corresponding period of 2011-12. Net flow through external commercial borrowings (ECBs) was higher during Q3 of 2012-13 compared to previous quarter, despite high principal repayments made by the Indian corporate sector. ECBs were mainly raised for the import of capital goods, new projects and the redemption of FCCBs. Benefitting from higher External debt witnessed steep rise in Q2 of 2012-13 III.15 India\u2019s external debt as at end-September 2012 was significantly higher than in the preceding quarter, with a rise in both long- term as well as short-term components of debt (Table III.6). In particular, there was a surge in non-resident external rupee-denominated the continued deposits (NRE), reflecting interest shown by non-residents due to better returns and rupee depreciation. After depreciating in October and November, the rupee exchange rate was range bound in December 2012 The rupee had recovered in September III.14 2012 due to the announcement of various reform measures by the government and increasing global risk appetite. However, challenged by concerns relating to high CAD and uncertainty regarding domestic growth, the rupee again showed a downtrend during October and November 2012 and subsequently remained range bound (`54.2\u201355.1 per US dollar) in December 2012. Reflecting the trend in the rupee in nominal terms, the REER based on 6-currency and 36-currency as on January 18, 2013 showed a depreciation of 3.5 per cent and 3.9 per cent, respectively, over end-March 2012 (Table III.5). 1 36- REER 36-NEER 6-REER 6-NEER `/US$ (end-March) NEER: Nominal Effective Exchange Rate.

III.16 The share of short-term debt in the composition of external debt has been rising in recent years, except for a dip in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis (Chart III.4). The dip in share of short-term debt immediately after the financial crisis was mainly due to a deceleration in short-term trade credit.

While the ratio of external debt (measured in terms of the rupee) to GDP showed marginal improvement, the ratio of short-term debt (original maturity) to external debt stayed at the same level as in the preceding quarter. However, the ratio of foreign exchange reserves to external debt deteriorated (Table III.7). investment III.18 position represented by net international liabilities, increased to US$ 271.5 billion at end-September 2012 from US$ 223.8 billion at end-June 2012. The rise in net liabilities occurred mainly due to a significant increase in liabilities and the valuation changes emanating from exchange rate movements. Accordingly, the NIIP-GDP ratio at end- September 2012 deteriorated compared with that at end-June 2012 (Table III.8). India\u2019s NIIP has shown gradual deterioration during the post-crisis period, as net international liabilities as a per cent of GDP increased from 5.5 per cent as at end-March 2008 to 15.3 per cent as at end-September 2012 due to the widening current account deficit. III.19 In sum, concerns about the sustainability of India\u2019s external sector have increased. Despite the second round of export promotion measures announced by the government, uncertainty relating to recovery in global economic and trade conditions may continue to weigh on India\u2019s exports. In order to bring the CAD on a sustainable path, the trends in India\u2019s imports, particularly POL and gold imports, need close monitoring. Even though the recent policy announcements in advanced economies have eased the global financial stress, re-acceleration of economic activity which is critical for recovery in global trade prospects may take time. Growth prospects for EMDEs also needs to improve in order to strengthen external demand for India. Even though abundant global liquidity augurs well for capital flows to economies like India, lowering CAD is important even as a sound domestic economic and business environment would continue to be critical to facilitate sustained capital flows and financing of CAD without stress. Monetary policy in this financial year so far has sought to balance the growth\u2013inflation dynamics through a combination of measured steps for liquidity easing and policy rate cut. While reserve money growth adjusted for CRR has maintained reasonable pace during Q3, broad money growth remained below the indicative trajectory. Aggregate deposit growth lagged behind credit growth, even as credit expansion remains moderate due to slack in activity and deterioration in the asset quality of banks. Despite considerable primary liquidity infusion by the Reserve Bank through CRR cuts and open market purchases of government securities, liquidity conditions tightened in Q3 of 2012-13. This was mainly because of an increase in government cash balances with the Reserve Bank. Going forward, contingent on further moderation in inflation, monetary policy could increasingly shift focus and respond to growth, giving due cognizance to the evolving macro-financial factors. Tightening cycle gradually inflation IV.1 financial year, growth has slowed markedly, even as inflation remained above the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level. Monetary Policy has responded to this evolving growth-inflation dynamics through calibrated easing. After lowering the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 125 basis points (bps) during Q4 of 2011-12, the Reserve Bank frontloaded a reduction in its repo rate by 50 bps in April 2012. Even as elevated inflation and the twin deficits have severely restricted impacted the space for further easing of the policy rate since April 2012, subsequent measures were directed towards ensuring adequate liquidity to facilitate a turnaround in credit deployment to productive sectors for supporting growth. As part of liquidity management measures, the CRR was reduced in two stages by a further 50 bps in a pre-emptive manner to ease monetary and liquidity conditions. Also, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) was reduced to improve the credit conditions facing the private sector (Table IV.1). Figures in parentheses indicate changes in policy rates/ratios. * : Per cent of Net Demand and Time Liabilities. IV.2 ore, apart from supplying liquidity through daily liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), the Reserve Bank made active use of the auctions under outright open market operations (OMOs) and injected primary liquidity of about `1.1 trillion coupled with liquidity injection of around `229 billion through anonymous trading platform (NDS- OM) in 2012-13 so far. The judicious use of the two sets of instruments, i.e., keeping the policy rate unchanged since April and pro- active liquidity easing measures conferred dual benefits that were evident as inflation gradually declined from its peak and credit off-take showed signs of improvements during most of November and December to 2012. Inflation, however, continues remain above the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level (Chart IV.1). measures, the liquidity deficit declined and returned to the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level and remained mostly there until the beginning of November 2012. To pre-empt any prospective tightening of liquidity conditions arising out of frictional factors such as advance tax outflows, festive season currency demand and increase in the wedge between the growth rates of credit and deposit, the Reserve Bank reduced the CRR by 25 bps in September 2012 in addition to the 100 bps SLR cut effective from August 2012 (Table IV.1). Since November 2012, the inter-bank market has witnessed a tightening of liquidity conditions mainly due to the build- up of government cash balances and rise in currency in circulation with the liquidity deficit crossing the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level of (-1) per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) (Chart IV.2). Reserve Bank takes measures to combat tight liquidity conditions Liquidity conditions since April 2012 IV.3 can be broadly classified into three phases. The financial year started with the spillover of the tight liquidity condition from the previous year, which was beyond the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort zone. The deficit was managed through a combination of primary liquidity injection through OMOs and LAF as well as an enhancement of the export credit refinance limit. The second phase commenced in July 2012 when, consequent upon these policy To address the tightness, the Reserve IV.4 Bank, after considering the prevailing macroeconomic situation, again reduced the CRR of scheduled banks by 25 basis points to 4.25 per cent of their NDTL effective November 3, 2012. Consequently, about `175 billion of primary liquidity was injected into the banking system. Liquidity deficit worsened due to an unprecedented increase in currency demand during the first half of November 2012. The quarterly advance tax outflows in December 2012 further increased the liquidity deficit (Chart IV.3). 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A 200 700 1200 Currency CRR *: (+) indicate injection while (-) indicate absorption of liquidity from the banking system.

The Reserve Bank injected primary liquidity through open market purchases to the tune of `391 billion during the month in addition to the liquidity injection through its LAF operations averaging about `1.2 trillion during the month. the large liquidity shortage since November 2012, there has been only one instance of recourse to Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) during November-December 2012. The call rate generally hovered around the repo rate, without significant spike, indicating the depth and resilience of the inter-bank market. This reflects the favourable effect of the new monetary policy operating procedure. Reserve money adjusted for CRR expanded at reasonable pace in Q3 of 2012-13 In January 2013, with an increase in IV.6 government spending, the recourse to LAF declined compared with the previous month. However, it continues to mostly remain higher than the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level. The Reserve Bank remains committed to actively liquidity conditions. Despite manage IV.7 Reserve money growth generally decelerated during Q3 of 2012-13, despite large injection of primary liquidity by the Reserve Bank through OMO and LAF (Chart IV.4).

On the components side, the decline in bankers\u2019 deposits with the Reserve Bank due to CRR cuts eroded the effect of the increasing trend in the currency in circulation that was observed during the quarter. The quantum of reserve money, adjusted for the first-round impact of the CRR cuts, however, increased during the quarter compared to a decline in previous quarter. The release of impounded liquidity through CRR cuts was expected to stimulate credit creation and positively impact the broad money growth through the multiplier mechanism. Broad money growth remains below indicative trajectory IV.8 Broad money growth decelerated in Q3 and fell below the indicative trajectory of the Reserve Bank, mainly due to deceleration in the growth of aggregate deposits (Table IV.2). On the sources side, both the global and domestic macroeconomic situation had some dampening impact on credit growth, which also muted the multiplier expansion that was expected to boost broad money growth (Chart IV.5).

With already tight liquidity conditions, the widening wedge poses a concern as it is likely to worsen the tight liquidity condition. Risk aversion impacting credit as asset quality concerns accentuate Increased wedge between credit and deposit growth remains a concern In 2012-13, the lack of commensurate IV.10 growth in aggregate deposit to fund the credit growth has given rise to an asset-liability gap, which is also indicated by the increase in the credit-deposit ratio (Chart IV.6). The deceleration in the term deposits, which constitutes the major component of aggregate deposit, could be largely attributed to the low and declining real interest rates on time deposits. Moreover, with an increase in the wedge IV.11 Besides sluggish demand, a major factor that could have led to the low credit growth of the PSBs over the past quarters is the deterioration in their asset quality (Table IV.3). Asset quality indicators of the banking sector, which had deteriorated significantly during 2011-12, have further deteriorated in the financial year so far (Table IV.4). The worsening asset quality during Q2 of 2012-13 continued to be led by public sector banks, which account for the major portion of bank advances. Deterioration in asset quality and 1 1.

This, in turn, led to a portfolio switch from credit creation to investment in SLR securities on the back of large government market borrowings (Chart IV.7). year so far. Though the impact of these policy measures is still unfolding, available data suggest that the transmission of the policy rate to deposit and lending rates of banks is relatively less pronounced than money market rates, reflecting the presence of structural rigidities in the credit market. Lagged monetary policy transmission to lending rate also indicates structural rigidities in the credit market Taking a cue from the reduction in the IV.12 policy rate (repo rate) by 50 bps in April 2012 and the subsequent reduction in the SLR by 100 bps in August 2012 and the CRR by 175 bps during January-November 2012, several banks have reduced their deposit and base rates during 2012-13 (up to January 15, 2013). Accordingly, the modal deposit rate and modal base rate of banks declined during the financial Non-bank domestic sources augmented flow of resources to the commercial sector IV.13 The total flow of financial resources to the commercial sector for the financial year so far (up to January 11, 2013) was higher compared with the corresponding period of the previous year (Table IV.5). The increase in flow has been accounted for by both bank and non-bank sources, though the latter played a dominant role. Among the domestic sources, non-food credit and non-SLR investment by SCBs, net issuance of commercial paper, net credit by housing finance companies, systemically taking NBFCs, witnessed large increase compared to corresponding period previous year. Foreign sources of funding (up to December 2012), also recorded marginal increase compared with the previous year, mainly on account of a higher external commercial borrowings/ foreign currency convertible bonds and short- term credit from abroad.

Monetary conditions may evolve with shifting growth-inflation dynamics Since January 2012, monetary policy IV.14 has sought to balance the growth\u2013inflation dynamics through a combination of liquidity easing measures and policy rate cut. It has reduced the CRR and the SLR and infused through open market primary purchases. After front-loading a 50 bps repo rate cut in April 2012, the Reserve Bank has maintained a pause on policy rate so far because of inflation remaining above its comfort level and the lack of requisite adjustments to fiscal and current account imbalances. Going forward, if inflation continues to trend down, monetary policy could increasingly shift focus and respond to growth moderation. However, the exact policy path would be contingent upon the evolving dynamics of inflation and growth, the trajectory of monetary and credit aggregates and other macroeconomic and financial parameters. Policy actions, both domestic and global, augured well for the Indian financial markets in Q3 of 2012-13. With aggressive monetary-easing measures by central banks of advanced economies and some policy initiatives in distressed euro area economies, capital flows surged into emerging economies. The Indian rupee and equity markets greatly benefitted from the improved investor optimism. Despite the domestic macroeconomic stress, expectations of a turnaround in the economy drove the rally in the Indian markets. Improved investor confidence was also visible from the pick-up in the IPO market after a subdued year. Global financial markets improve on euro area policy action and fiscal cliff agreement V.1 International financial market conditions improved in Q3 of 2012-13 despite a fragile global economic outlook. Recent financial market developments indicate a perceived reduction in some major downside risks to the world economy. The easing of stress can be seen in the positive streak shown by Bloomberg\u2019s Composite Financial Conditions Index (BFCIUS Index) that tracks the overall stress in money, bond, and equity markets, thereby enabling assessment of the availability and cost of credit (Chart V.1a). near-term The V.2 the euro area crisis also worsening of appears to have declined following new policy announcements and the extension of financial help troubled periphery to economies. In December 2012, the euro area finance ministers empowered the European Central Bank (ECB) as the common bank supervisor from 2014. They also approved \u20ac39.5 billion aid to Spanish banks. International leaders also agreed upon a deal to again restructure Greece\u2019s debt, with further large hair cuts that paved the way for the release of \u20ac34.4 billion in aid payment. Following these developments, credit default swap (CDS) spreads for European economies have reduced. V.3 With the improvement in borrowing conditions in the financial markets, the 10-year G-sec interest rate spread between distressed euro area countries such as Spain, Italy, Ireland and Portugal, and Germany declined (Chart V.1b). The Italian and Spanish governments were also able to raise longer-maturity debt from the markets with improvements in funding conditions. V.4 Global equity prices showed major gains in 2012, as investor preference to hold risky assets increased following quantitative stimuli announced by major central banks, despite weak corporate earnings. The mini- fiscal deal clinched by the US also aided the rally in global markets in 2013 so far (Chart V.1 c). Stock market uncertainty, as measured by implied volatility, also decreased during the period under review (Chart V.1d). AE central banks\u2019 unconventional policy stimuli boost market sentiments V.5 Unprecedented monetary stimuli by central banks of advanced economies (AEs), which include QE3 and recently announced additional purchase of long-term treasury securities to the tune of US$ 45 billion per month by the US Federal Reserve (Fed), the outright monetary transactions (OMT) programme by the ECB and the asset purchase programme by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), as well as measures taken by the European Union to contain the 0.5 1.0 1.5 t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 2.0 2.5 3.0 : e s a B euro area debt crisis, have helped revive global financial market sentiments. Concomitantly, the balance sheets of these central banks have expanded significantly (Chart V.2). V.6 Despite the positive impact of central banks\u2019 unconventional monetary policy actions, the future impact of such policy is of concern as latter rounds of QE had a subdued effect (Chart V.3a). Monetary policy stimuli in Q4 of 2012 did not necessarily have a dampening effect on the long-term treasury yield in the US (Chart V.3b). This could be because, in the absence of a credible long-term fiscal consolidation plan, yields may have become less responsive to central bank actions. On the whole, the evaluation of the success of QE would require further research.

India and other Asian countries, such as South Korea, Philippines and Thailand, received higher FII inflows in 2012 than in 2011 (Chart V.4). Apart from the push factors discussed V.8 above, various pull factors emanating from domestic factors, such as the continued dependence of the Indian economy on domestic consumption unlike other export- driven economies and the relatively stable earnings of listed companies, aided the surge in flows into India. The domestic reform measures announced by the government since mid-September 2012 also boosted investor sentiments. Indian equity markets showed rupee turnaround, while significant remained range-bound. Money markets remained stable despite liquidity deficit V.9 liquidity conditions due to advance tax payments, high government cash balances and rise in currency in circulation, the weighted average call money rate generally remained around the repo rate in Q3 of 2012-13. The rates in the collateralised segments i.e., CBLO and market repo, which constitute the predominant share (around 80 per cent) of the overnight money market, moved in tandem with the call money rate (Chart V.5).

Increased risk aversion by banks to lend V.11 to the corporate sector, as evident from the moderation in credit off-take, also manifested in a significant uptick in the size of fortnightly issuance of commercial paper (CP). The weighted average discount rate (WADR) of aggregate CP issuances decreased to 9.0 per cent at end-December 2012 from 12.2 per cent at end-March 2012. Yield curve gets inverted on economic slack and as borrowing programme stays on track V.12 During Q3 of 2012-13, G-sec yields firmed up in October, but declined markedly since December, with bonds rallying in response to four major factors. First, the market assessed that the year may pass without borrowing. Second, expectations of a rate cut were built on moderating inflation. Third, resumption of OMO purchases by the Reserve Bank also led to a rally in G-sec market. Fourth, on review of the government\u2019s cash position, the auction of dated securities scheduled for January 4, 2013 got postponed to late February 2013, which also caused the yields to soften. The 10-year generic yield declined from 8.63 per cent at end-March 2012 to 7.99 per cent on January 1, 2013 and further to 7.88 per cent as on January 24, 2013 (Chart V.6). r e p n i d l e i Y r e p n i d l e i Y However, during Q3, the fall in short V.13 term yields was not as significant, largely on account of persistent tightness in liquidity and the government\u2019s decision to increase the quantity of T-bill issuances during the last quarter of the fiscal. With the spread between the yield on the 10-year G-sec and 91-day T-bill turning negative, the G-sec market showed an inverted yield curve. During the financial year, up to January 21, 2013, the weighted average maturity of the dated securities issued has increased to 13.5 years from 12.5 years during the corresponding period last year. The bid-cover ratio stood in the range of 1.36-4.10 as against 1.39-5.12 in the previous year (Table V.2). In the same period, 27 states have V.14 raised `1.3 trillion on a gross basis compared with around `1.1 trillion raised during the corresponding period of the previous year. Rupee exchange rate remained range bound in Q3 of 2012-13 Following in September 2012, the rupee movement turned range bound with a weakening bias, reflecting the wide trade deficit (Chart V.7). V.16 As on January 23, 2013, the rupee showed lower depreciation over end-March 2012 compared to other major EMDEs like Brazil, South Africa and Argentina (Table V.3). V.15 including liberalised FDI limits for certain sectors and the announcement of a fiscal consolidation path, enhanced global investor confidence in the Indian economy. This, along with announcements of quantitative easing by the US Fed and the BOJ, boosted capital inflows to India and aided the recovery of the rupee. 1. Brazilian Real 10.8 10.4 3. Mexican Peso 4.

Following the global equity market rally driven by a spate of generally better international economic data and policy actions, the Indian bourses also picked up. The BSE Sensex and S&P CNX Nifty crossed the 20,000 and 6,000 mark, respectively after two years.

V.19 indicators, such as market capitalisation and daily turnover, have shown an increasing trend in 2012, reflecting the positive sentiment in the Indian stock market. Further, the PE ratio of the BSE Sensex increased in 2012, indicating a rise in the valuation of Indian stock over the year. V.22 As at end-December 2012, the BSE Bankex, which represents major banks in India, recorded much higher y-o-y gains of 57 per cent than the BSE Sensex (26 per cent), despite concerns about modest loan growth, deterioration in asset quality and alleviated that the BSE Bankex favourably influenced are the strong balance sheet performance by some private sector banks, stable net interest margin owing to a reduction in the CRR by 175 basis points of NDTL and expectation of treasury profit as bonds rallied.

V.23 During September\u2013December 2012, `110 billion was mobilised through 18 issues compared to `23 billion mobilised through 11 issues during the corresponding period last year (Chart V.9). Various measures taken by SEBI, such as allowing qualified foreign investors (QFIs) to invest in the primary as well as secondary markets, electronic initial public offers (e-IPOs), requiring companies to attain the minimum public shareholding of 25 per cent by June 2013, introduction of the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme, 2012 and the disinvestment programme by the government may also enhance primary market activity. House prices show slight moderation, but with increasing volumes The annual growth in the Reserve V.24 Bank\u2019s quarterly House Price Index at the all- India level remains strong at 23 per cent in Q2 of 2012-13. The q-o-q increase, however, moderated to 3 per cent, the lowest in the past seven quarters. Transaction volumes have Markets improve, but uncertainty still significant for 2013 V.25 Reduced fiscal space in several AEs and limited scope for monetary policy actions due to the enlarged balance sheets of central banks are expected to keep sentiments and markets range bound. The stress in the global financial markets has eased in view of reduced uncertainties in the euro area and the temporary resolution of the fiscal cliff in the U.S. However, a credible fiscal consolidation by the US can generate a more significant impact. Quantitative easing by the AEs has translated into higher capital flows to EMDEs, including India, which may witness some moderation going forward, but is nevertheless, likely to remain positive in the near term. V.26 Looking at domestic factors, commitment to reforms and efforts for sustainable fiscal consolidation would provide a positive impetus to the markets. Stronger signs of global and domestic recovery are crucial to support investor optimism. Headline inflation moderated from over 8 per cent in September 2012 to 7.2 per cent in December 2012. The significant slowdown in growth below trend led to a decline in non-food manufactured products inflation. Food inflation, however, continued to persist at elevated levels as new drivers emerged, which was also reflected in double-digit consumer price inflation. Inflation is expected to moderate gradually, supported by softer global commodity prices and weak domestic demand even though some pressure could be felt from the staggered increases in diesel prices. Also, there are continued risks from persistent price pressures from food, high inflation expectations and wage-price spiral, leading to further pressure on generalised inflation. Global inflation conditions remain benign, albeit with some pressure in EMDEs VI.1 Subdued global inflation environment in AEs continued into Q3 of 2012-13, as weaker global growth dampened demand conditions and commodity prices remained range bound. The average inflation in OECD countries was 1.9 per cent in November 2012, with core inflation (excluding food and fuel) being lower at 1.6 per cent. Among the major EMDEs, China recorded inflation of 2.5 per cent in December 2012, while inflation in Russia, Brazil and South Africa ruled above 5 per cent. exceptionally low levels of 0 to 0.25 per cent until at least mid-2015 with an indication to do so till: (i) the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent, (ii) inflation between 1\u20132 years ahead was projected at no more than a 0.5 percentage point above its 2 per cent longer-run goal, and (iii) longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well-anchored. However, in January 2013 it indicated the possible end of QE before the end of the year on concerns over the sustainability of such large-scale asset purchases in view of risks associated with financial stability and the size of its balance sheet. Fresh round of quantitative easing (QE) enhances global liquidity VI.2 Continued weakness in the global economy has forced the central banks in most AEs to continue with extremely easy monetary policy of near zero nominal interest rates and quantitative easing (Table VI.1). VI.3 The US Federal Reserve (US Fed) expanded its QE from the start of 2013 with the expiry of Operation Twist. The Bank of Japan expanded the size of its QE further and in January 2013 adopted a revised inflation target of 2 per cent. The US Fed also tweaked its September 2012 forward guidance of keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at VI.4 As the recovery prospects for the global economy remain weak (see Chapter 1) amidst high unemployment, spare capacity and subdued wage pressures, the monetary policy stance of AEs is likely to continue to remain accommodative. Following significant slowdown in growth in the recent period, more and more central banks in EMDEs have reduced their policy rates to address growth concerns.

Source: Websites of respective central banks/statistical agencies. Crude oil prices moderated as supply prospects improved and geo-political tensions eased in the Middle East. Moreover, the prospects of a weaker global economy also played a role in keeping oil prices range-bound. Metal prices continued to show signs of weakening as demand has slowed significantly, especially from China. VI.6 The near-term outlook on global crude oil prices indicates a softening bias as many of the factors that led to lower crude prices in 2012 continue to play out. While continued slow growth of AEs and EMDEs is expected to keep demand subdued, the prospects of improved production from a number of oil-producing economies along with a possible step-up in shale oil and gas production could keep overall demand-supply conditions in favour of lower price levels. However, a major decline in oil prices seems unlikely given the tight demand- supply balance, offsetting pressure from QE and the risks of geo-political tensions further feeding into oil prices. VI.7 International food prices moderated in recent months from the sudden spike witnessed in Q2 of 2012-13 following severe droughts this year in the US, a large part of Europe, central Asia and Australia. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the shortfall in global production of cereals, especially for wheat and coarse cereals could be met by drawdown of stocks. Despite some moderation, the current level of food prices remain significantly high compared to historical levels and food prices remain extremely vulnerable to shocks induced by weather-related disturbances, which have increased in the recent period. 9 0 - r p A 9 0 - g u A 0 1 - r p A 0 1 - g u A 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A Headline consumer price inflation remained high VI.8 Headline Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation (y-o-y) in India moderated from 8.1 per cent in September 2012 to 7.2 per cent (provisional) in December 2012. The moderation in inflation during Q3 of 2012-13 was faster than expected during the second quarter review. Vegetable and fruit prices declined as the south-west monsoon revived in the latter half. The moderation was also driven by a decline in the prices of freely- priced fuel products and metals in line with some moderation in their global prices. A range-bound exchange rate further helped this course. Moreover, the indirect impact of the diesel price hike in September 2012 remained contained, indicating that firms did not pass on rising input costs to output prices on account of weak demand conditions. inflation moderated, September 2012, as prices remained range- bound in all the three major groups of the WPI (Chart VI.3). VI.10 Though headline inflation moderated somewhat, price increases for items under administered prices have been much higher than those for freely-priced products in the recent period (Chart VI.4). Moderation in inflation, commensurate with slowdown in growth, is getting constrained by suppressed inflation coming into the open with administered price revisions, especially on fuel products such as diesel and electricity. Though such revisions add to near-term price pressures, they are desirable from a medium-term price stability objective, as suppressed inflation could lead to fiscal costs in terms of mounting subsidies that could turn inflationary. VI.9 The build-up in price pressures seems to have tapered off in recent months, as the headline WPI remained almost flat (Chart VI.2). The momentum of price changes, as indicated by the 3-month moving average seasonally adjusted month-over-month changes, also indicate significant moderation. The financial year build-up of inflation during 2012-13 (up to December 2012) indicates that the price pressures that were building up in the initial months have eased significantly since 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A mill products, edible oils and oil cakes. The increase in edible oil and oil cake prices could be attributed to significant increases in oilseeds prices in the recent period. Though there has been some moderation in December 2012, y-o-y price increases in oilseeds remain high at 29 per cent. The increase in the price of oil cake, used as a fodder, could spill over to milk prices. 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A Food inflation remains persistent as new drivers emerge VI.11 Food inflation continued to remain high as new drivers of food inflation emerged (Chart VI.5). With the late revival of the monsoon, prices cooled off, especially for vegetables and fruits. Price pressures, however, continued to remain significant for cereals and pulses, with financial year build-up of cereals inflation at 16 per cent and pulses at 19 per cent (up to December 2012). It may be noted that the impact of the delayed and skewed south-west monsoon was significant on the production of cereals and pulses. Inflation in protein-rich food items remained elevated, notwithstanding some moderation in recent months. VI.12 Manufactured food products inflation also remained near double digits, as price increases were significant in sugar, grain VI.13 inflation has emerged as a major challenge for inflation management. There has been a significant increase in the cost of production in agriculture, driven largely by the increase in wage costs, which has also resulted in higher minimum support prices. Also, the changing pattern of consumption in favour of protein-rich items has not been matched by supply elasticities, which add to price pressures in these products. Augmenting supply capacities and integrating the supply chain by removing inefficiencies could be critical in achieving the goal of stable food prices. Moderate decline in fuel inflation aided by rupee appreciation, but suppressed inflation persists `5 per VI.14 The revision in diesel prices by litre in September 2012 led to fuel inflation reverting to double digits. However, in October and November 2012, prices of freely-priced fuel products declined aided by a stronger 5.0 15.0 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A 25.0 5.0 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A rupee and some decline in international crude oil prices. In December 2012, there was a marginal increase owing to higher bitumen prices. VI.15 The revision in administered fuel prices and some decline in freely-priced fuel product prices led to partial closing of the gap between the two price levels (Chart VI.6). Despite this, the magnitude continues to remain large, which has resulted in the build-up of under-recoveries of the oil marketing companies (OMCs) to the tune of `1.25 trillion during April-December 2012, of which 59 per cent was on account of diesel. VI.16 Given this unsustainable level of under- recoveries, the government on January 17, 2013 allowed the OMCs to raise the retail price of diesel in a staggered manner and to charge bulk consumers of diesel taking supplies directly from the installations of the OMCs at non-subsidised prices. Accordingly, the retail price of diesel was increased by `0.45 per litre (excluding VAT) and the price of diesel for bulk consumers was increased by `9.25 per litre (excluding VAT) from January 18, 2013. The government also decided to raise the number of subsidised LPG cylinders per customer from 6 to 9 in a financial year. While the increase in diesel prices could lead to higher price levels in the near-term, the reduction in fiscal burden as prices get adjusted would help in medium- term inflation management. VI.17 domestic fuel inflation at a time when global fuel prices remained range-bound reflects the role that administered prices play in shaping the inflation trajectory. For most periods, inflation in administered fuel products freely-priced remained well below products under the fuel group, contributing to suppressed inflation. Now, revisions of administered prices are driving up fuel inflation at a time when freely-priced products show a significant decline in inflation, thereby making fuel inflation more persistent (Chart VI.7). VI.18 Though global crude price (Indian basket) declined by about 2 per cent in dollar terms during April-December 2012 compared to the corresponding period in the previous year, in rupee terms it increased by about 13 per cent, owing to the depreciation of the rupee. Administered price revisions were much lower than the increase in global prices, which further increased the subsidy burden. This had also limited the demand adjustments to price and exchange rate signals, thereby leading to a widening of the current account deficit (see Chapter III for details). The recent revision in diesel prices could be expected to correct some of these imbalances. Core inflation pressure has eased and is likely to remain subdued amidst the slowdown VI.19 inflation, Non-food manufactured 10 20 9 0 - r p A 9 0 - g u A 0 1 - r p A 0 1 - g u A 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A 30 5 0 - g u A 6 0 - g u A 7 0 - g u A 8 0 - g u A 9 0 - g u A 0 1 - g u A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - g u A inflationary pressures, declined considerably to 4.2 per cent (provisional) in December 2012 from 5.8 per cent in August 2012. The month-over-month seasonally adjusted annualised changes (3-month moving average) also indicate significant moderation in price pressures in recent months. VI.20 The decline in inflation in this segment reflects both the impact of the growth slowdown, which has impacted the pricing power, as well as the pass-through of lower commodity prices, especially that of metals, as the exchange rate volatility has reduced. This also indicates the moderating impact of tight monetary policy on inflation, which is now becoming increasingly visible, albeit with a lag. VI.21 manufactured non-food products, \u2018basic metals and metals products\u2019 has been the major driver of the recent decline in inflation. It is also seen that the contribution of metals and chemicals to inflation in non- food manufacturing has been significantly high in the recent period (Chart VI.8). Month- over-month price changes in most commodity groups remained marginal, indicating that the pressure on generalised inflation has ebbed significantly in the recent period. year was expected to provide some comfort in on generalised items such as metals and chemicals, that have a significant weight in the non-food manufactured products component of the WPI. However, the depreciation of the rupee offset this favourable impact for most of this period, thereby leading to the persistence of inflation (Chart VI.9). Risks to inflation persist from high fiscal deficit, if not contained VI.23 The high level of fiscal deficit and higher revenue expenditure by the government may add to the inflationary process. Incomplete pass-through of energy prices may result in higher subsidies, which are also inflationary. While in the present macroeconomic scenario of below-trend growth the risks to inflation from the fiscal deficit may not be visible in the near term, the medium-term inflationary impact cannot be overlooked. Empirical estimates indicate that the fiscal deficit significantly contributes to inflation in the long run. There is, therefore, a need to move towards further fiscal consolidation. Depreciation of the rupee offset the impact of softer global commodity prices on domestic inflation VI.22 The impact of softer global commodity prices during 2012 compared to the previous Persistent wage inflation pressures may constrain inflation moderation VI.24 ral wages indicate that the pace of increase in rural wages moderated from a peak of about 22 per cent (y-o-y) in August 2011 to about 18 per cent in s t n i o P e g a t n e c r e P n i n o i t u b i r t n o C 10 1.0 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A 20 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A Rupee depreciation vs US$ November 2012. This, along with an increase in inflation in rural areas in recent months, led to a decline in real wage growth to about 6.5 per cent in November 2012. Though a rapid increase in wages (both nominal and real) has been a common phenomenon during the current high inflation period, a comparison with the previous period (2002-07) reveals that a significant increase in real wages occurred only in the recent period (Chart VI.10). Empirical estimates of causality between wages and inflation in rural areas show that in the recent period causality ran from wages to prices, indicating that increase in real wages has been feeding into the cost of production and also sustaining demand, thereby leading to higher prices. State-specific factors also play a major role in wage-price dynamics as is evident from the large variation in inflation and wage growth in rural areas across major states (Chart VI.11). VI.25 There is also evidence that increasing wage costs are a source of concern even in the organised sector. Private sector surveys indicate that wage increases in India are much higher than in other EMDEs. In the private corporate sector, the increase in staff costs remained at double digits, indicating persistent pressure from wage costs (see Chapter II). Divergence between CPI and WPI inflation persists VI.26 Even as WPI inflation moderated, inflation, as per the all-India new Consumer Price Index (CPI-combined: rural+urban), remained elevated, with inflation for December 2012 at 10.6 per cent. Double-digit food inflation in the new CPI, which has a higher weight for food than the WPI, continues to keep CPI inflation above the WPI. Also, in the new-CPI, excluding the food and fuel component, inflation remains much higher than the WPI (Table VI.2). This could be partly because the WPI does not cover services and rent, whereas both are covered in the new CPI. In terms of contribution to inflation, the pattern remained consistent in the recent period with the food and beverage group being the major driver. The persistence of high CPI inflation compared to the headline inflation moderation is a source of concern. 5 2 0 - r p A 3 0 - r p A 4 0 - r p A 5 0 - r p A 6 0 - r p A 7 0 - r p A 8 0 - r p A 9 0 - r p A 0 1 - r p A 1 1 - r p A 2 1 - r p A Inflation remains divergent between rural and urban areas across product groups VI.27 Though the overall inflation in rural and urban areas remains close (at 10.7 and 10.4 per cent, respectively, in December 2012), there is wide variation in inflation across various commodity groups (Chart VI.12). In the case of vegetables, condiments & spices and milk, inflation is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, even though rural areas are the producers of these products. In urban areas, cereals, pulses, prepared meals, sugar and some miscellaneous goods and services report higher inflation. It is also observed that food prices are more volatile in urban areas than in rural areas. The role of supply-chain inefficiencies merits closer analysis in this context. Inflation moderation may be constrained by persistent risks during 2013-14 VI.28 in both headline and core inflation reflects the impact of a significant slowdown in growth and past monetary policy measures. While the supply- side pressure from high food prices persists, suppressed inflation in the fuel group needs to be passed on even at the cost of a higher inflation reading in the short term. VI.29 likely forward, while persistence of a high consumer price inflation remains a concern, expected moderation in headline WPI inflation in Q4 of 2012-13 could improve the overall inflation scenario. Softer global commodity prices could keep pressure from imported inflation benign, though risks from global commodity price volatility and exchange rate changes cannot be ruled out. Further moderation in food inflation would be conditional on easing of supply pressures, as well as improving the efficiency of the supply chain. The revision in diesel prices announced on January 17, 2013 and the proposed staggered increases in the coming months will result in higher inflation numbers in the near-term. Price pressures can also arise from possible adjustments in prices of coal and electricity. Nevertheless, these steps are desirable from a medium-term inflation management point of view. The pressure on generalised inflation, however, can be expected to remain muted given the weak pricing power of firms. Pressures from industrial raw material prices, which had been a significant source of inflation in non-food manufactured products in the recent past, are also abating. However, the risks of entrenchment of higher food inflation into higher inflation expectations and a wage-price spiral remain. Given these risks, the moderation in inflation is expected to be gradual. oing 5.0 s t a f d n a d n a k l i d n a s t n e m i d n o C s e c i p s s e l b a t e g e V s t i u r F d n a g n i h t o l C g n i d d e b r a e w t o o F d n a n o i t a e r c e R t n e m e s u m a d n a n o i t a c i n u m m o c & h s i f t a e m c t e r a g u S c i l o h o c l a - n o N s e g a r e v e b d e r a p e r P c t e s l a e m & o c c a b o t , n a P s t n a c i x o t n i t h g i l d n a e r a c l a c i d e M n o i t a c u d E s e t i s i u q e r Growth remains subdued due to a combination of external and domestic factors. Various surveys show that business and consumer confidence remain subdued. Government\u2019s commitment to reforms is expected to instill confidence among investors and support gradual recovery. Inflation has moderated but remains high. The decline has not been commensurate with the slowdown in growth and upside risks remain from suppressed inflation. While government has embarked on a fiscal adjustment path, staying on this course over the medium-term is necessary for providing sufficient space for monetary policy to stimulate growth. The widening current account deficit also remains a major source of concern. While domestic and global conditions are expected to improve slowly, calibration of the policy stance is important due to prevailing uncertainties. Reforms reduce immediate risks, but long road ahead The fresh round of reforms that were VII.1 initiated in September 2012, after a hiatus, has the reduced Indian economy. The recent measures taken, especially in January 2013 have further reinforced this momentum. There are signs that growth may have bottomed out, though recovery may take some more time and is likely to be paced gradually. However, on an immediate footing, the recent reforms and measures to debottleneck infrastructure and other sectors have reduced the macroeconomic and financial risks facing the Indian economy. These measures need to be carried forward as certain key constraints continue to impede investments in road and power sectors. As the to envisaged measures are remove the impediments, the economy can start turning around in 2013-14. However, immediate risks facing implemented weak global economic conditions, domestic business constraints and low confidence levels may keep the recovery modest next year, while the near-term risks to the economy emanating from fiscal and external imbalances remain. Clearly, there is a long road ahead to VII.2 regain the pre-crisis potential growth. Traversing this requires tough economic and political decisions that do not fritter away the recent modest gains, as the compulsions of political cycles mount in the run-up to the 2014 general elections. Business sentiments stay weak, further action needed to restore confidence VII.3 Latest rounds of business confidence surveys portray a mixed picture. On the whole, it appears that the reform measures taken so far have not decisively lifted business sentiments and further action may be needed to restore confidence. VII.4 survey shows a further drop in business confidence, due mainly to perceptions on climate deteriorating (Table VII.1). The CII\u2019s Business Confidence Index showed a marginal fall in business confidence during Q3 of 2012-13. Domestic economic developments, high interest rates, infrastructure bottlenecks and institutional issues emerged as key concerns in the survey. However, FICCI\u2019s overall business VII.5 index suggests a significant confidence improvement in business confidence. Reform measures, including opening up of FDI in lifted multi-brand retail appear sentiments, though inadequate infrastructure and rising costs of manpower and raw materials were cited as constraints.

VII.8 The Business Expectation Index (BEI), a composite indicator based on several business parameters, signals marginal improvement for Q3 of 2012-13. However, the index remained broadly at the same level for Q4 (Chart VII.1). These indices have persisted in the growth terrain (i.e. above 100, which is the threshold separating contraction from expansion). VII.9 Analysis of the net responses among various components of demand conditions shows that the assessment on production remained flat in Q3 of 2012-13. The declining trend in the net response on order books in the previous two quarters was reversed in Q3 of 2012-13. While the respondent companies had lower optimism on capacity utilisation, exports and imports during Q3 of 2012-13, their outlook for Q4 of 2012-13 shows improvement (Table VII.2).

Forecasts suggest gradual recovery with higher projected GDP growth in 2013-14 while the average WPI inflation is projected to gradually moderate in the coming year. The twin deficits are expected to improve in 2013- 14 with the CAD as a percentage of GDP projected to moderate to 3.5 per cent and the central government fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP projected to fall to 5.3 per cent (Table VII.4). Inflation expectations see marginal increase VII.14 Inflation Expectations Survey of Households (IESH) conducted (http://www.rbi.org.in/IESH30) among 5,000 households across 16 cities (of which 4 cities are covered for the first time in this round) and 7 occupational categories during November 30 to December 7, 2012, indicates that the perception of current inflation as well as the expectations on future inflation have increased marginally (q-o-q) in Q3 of the percentage of 2012-13. However, respondents expecting a higher rise in prices in Q4 of 2012-13 as well as in Q3 of 2013-14 has decreased as compared with the last round of the survey. Output gap may start closing in 2013-14, although at a slow pace VII.15 On current assessment, growth in 2012- 13 is likely to fall below the Reserve Bank\u2019s baseline projection of 5.8 per cent set out in the Second Quarter Review (October 2012). The IIP recorded a dismal growth of 1.0 per cent during April-November 2012. The full year growth may fall even below last year\u2019s 1 The forecasts reflect the views of professional forecasters and not of the Reserve Bank. disappointing 2.9 per cent growth. With a generalised slowdown in consumption as well as investment, a turnaround looks difficult this year. VII.16 However, the output gap could start closing in 2013-14 on the back of some revival in investment demand. The improvement would, inter alia, hinge on inflation receding which will support higher consumption. Current slack demand has not been associated with a build-up of finished goods inventories as firms have cut down supplies in response to falling demand. This raises hopes that the inventory cycle may be supportive of recovery when it shapes up. External demand has already shrunk and as a baseline case, is also unlikely to dampen growth ahead. As such, it is important to quickly move to resolve the problems that are still impeding investments particularly in the infrastructure and mining sector. and wage-inflation spiral would need to be maintained. Fiscal risks moderate in 2012-13, but commitment sustained fiscal to generate is needed consolidation monetary space VII.19 Fiscal risks have declined in recent months as the government re-dedicated itself to the goals of fiscal consolidation. However, a sustainable path to fiscal consolidation hinges on fundamental fiscal reforms that cut subsidies and augment revenues. Measures to contain subsidies have been initiated and would need to be persisted with. Front-loaded fiscal consolidation would generate sufficient space for monetary policy to act without stoking inflationary pressures. Wide CAD remains a constraint on monetary policy easing Inflation risks may remain in 2013-14 VII.17 Although, inflation is likely to moderate to below the baseline projection of 7.5 per cent for March 2013 set in the October policy, the direct and indirect impact of the recent increase in diesel prices would exert some upward pressure on overall price level. Suppressed inflation continues to pose a significant risk to the inflation trajectory in 2013-14 and as some of this risks materializes, inflation path may turn sticky. Amidst the large current account deficit (CAD), the possibility of currency depreciation and its pass-through to domestic prices constitutes an additional risk that cannot be glossed over. On the other hand, as fundamentals improve, it could impart strength to the rupee. This can have a favourable impact on inflation. VII.18 An important element in the inflation mathematics is that core inflation pressures have markedly receded and are unlikely to re- emerge quickly on demand considerations. However, a close vigil on cost-push inflation VII.20 At the present juncture, the widening CAD has become a major constraint on easing monetary policy. Even if inflation recedes further, the wide CAD may slow the pace and extent to which monetary policy can be eased. With the likelihood that the CAD may exceed 4 per cent of GDP for the second successive year in 2012-13, prudence is necessary while stimulating aggregate demand. VII.21 Given, India\u2019s growth potential and liberalised capital account there may be a case that India can run a wider CAD/GDP ratio than was possible in the 1980s and 1990s. In inter- temporal terms, it can import more today, if it can export more in future. While it can build up liabilities to the rest of world that are financed by inflows in the financial account, it is important to ensure that the borrowed capital is productively used for real investments that yield marginal product in excess of the interest rate the country has to pay on the foreign liabilities. Secondly, even if CAD is inter- temporally solvent, a view is necessary whether the size of the CAD is easily financeable given the shocks that can emerge from volatile capital flows, which include surges and sudden stops or reversals. payments position is likely to remain vulnerable to global growth cycles and oil price fluctuations. VII.22 assessment forward-looking provided in the previous Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments clearly pointed to a widening of the CAD in Q2 of 2012-13. It had emphasised the need to stay on the path of fiscal consolidation, as also keeping a tab on private consumption and supplementing it with the selective use of expenditure-switching policies to lower the CAD. This was one of the key considerations while setting the monetary policy in October and December 2012. With the CAD turning out to be a record high of 5.4 per cent of GDP in Q2 of 2012-13, further caution is warranted while framing monetary and fiscal policies. VII.23 While making the overall interest rate environment more conducive to investments and with some improvement in consumption, it is necessary to ensure that fiscal and monetary policies do not lose control over government or private consumption spending, even if it means a more gradual recovery of the Indian economy. Given India\u2019s low trade elasticities, especially at this point of time when world demand is low, there is little alternative but to use expenditure-reducing policies in addition to expenditure-switching policies to bring CAD down to a more sustainable level of around 2.5 per cent of GDP. At the same time, reducing dependence on debt-creating capital inflows is needed. This is particularly important as the export prospects remain impacted by global slowdown. On the other side, India\u2019s energy security position is likely to keep imports high. As a result, the balance of Balance of macroeconomic risks suggests continuation of calibrated stance VII.24 the considerations discussed above, the balance of macro- economic risks suggests continuation of a calibrated stance. In Q3 of 2012-13 headline inflation has receded somewhat faster-than- anticipated. Core inflationary pressures have turned subdued. However, headline also inflation has not declined at a pace commensurate with the negative output gap that has now prevailed for the fifth successive quarter. The size of the negative output gap now exceeds one per cent of GDP. While growth remains low, inflation concerns have not dissipated. Consumer inflation remains high and even the headline remains above the comfort level. VII.25 The emerging slack in investment needs to be addressed. This slack has emerged from a combination of domestic and global factors. While global growth may remain slow for some more years as significant fiscal adjustment the debt overhang in the advanced economies, the domestic growth could respond to the policy action that has now begun. Given the preponderance of non-monetary factors behind the current slowdown in an environment where risks from high inflation, current account and fiscal deficits still remain, the scope for supportive monetary policy action is constrained. However, as reform actions get executed, monetary policy could increasingly focus on growth revival. is needed to overcome ", "file7": "Advanced Economies - Current Account De\ufb01 cit - Con\ufb01 dence Interval - Consumer Price Index - Cash Reserve Ratio - European Central Bank - Emerging and Developing Economies - Foreign Direct Investment - Foreign Institutional Investors - First Quarter Review - General Anti-Avoidance Rule - Gross Domestic Product - Government Securities - Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd.

In the US, activity gathered momentum in Q3 of 2012 but this is unlikely to have been sustained in Q4. While a political consensus to avert the \u2018\ufb01 scal cliff\u2019 has calmed \ufb01 nancial markets, how the debt ceiling is managed will be crucial in shaping market sentiment on the way forward. The euro area economy is threatened by continuing contraction, notwithstanding the liquidity \ufb01 rewall of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the commitment to act collectively to backstop the union. Overall, however, risks of the sovereign debt crisis disrupting the global \ufb01 nancial system have ebbed. Japan has re-entered recession. Among the emerging and developing economies (EDEs), a pick-up in the pace of growth in China is likely. A combination of a slump in external demand and domestic structural bottlenecks has slowed down growth in most other EDEs. Furthermore, in\ufb02 ationary pressures persist in some of them. Overall, global economic prospects have improved modestly since the SQR even as signi\ufb01 cant risks remain. Domestically, growth remains 2. sluggish, notwithstanding some tentative signs of the slowdown beginning to level off. Industrial activity weakened, reflecting subdued manufacturing, deceleration in electricity generation and contraction in mining activity. While the series of policy measures announced by the Government has boosted market sentiment, the investment outlook is still lacklustre, especially in terms of demand for new projects. Consumption demand too is slowing. As regards prospects for agriculture, whether the rabi output will offset the shortfall in the kharif output is as yet unclear. Lead indicators of service sector activity point to an expansion in the months ahead, albeit constrained by the drag imposed by depressed global demand conditions. 3. Headline wholesale price in\ufb02 ation, led by non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation, has softened through Q3, providing some relief from the persistence that dominated the \ufb01 rst half of the year. On the other hand, food inflation has edged up, pushing up consumer price in\ufb02 ation in turn. Lead indicators such as weaker pricing power of corporates, excess capacity in some sectors, the possibility of international commodity prices stabilising as assessed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and momentum measures suggest that in\ufb02 ationary pressures have peaked. However, further moderation in domestic in\ufb02 ation going into 2013-14 is likely to be muted as the correction of under- pricing of administered items is still incomplete and food in\ufb02 ation remains elevated. Accordingly, the setting of monetary policy has to remain sensitive to con\ufb02 icting pressures and attendant risks. 4. This policy review is accordingly set in the context of a slowly improving global environment and a tipping point in the balance of risks between growth and in\ufb02 ation on the domestic front. It should be read and understood together with the detailed review in Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments released yesterday by the Reserve Bank. This Statement is organised in 5. four sections: Section I provides an overview of global and domestic macroeconomic developments; Section II sets out the outlook and projections for growth, inflation and monetary aggregates; Section III explains the stance of monetary policy; and Section IV speci\ufb01 es the monetary measures. 6. Signs of stabilisation in global economic activity have been in evidence in recent months, led by stronger than expected growth in the US in Q3, acceleration in the pace of activity in China and a pick-up in industrial production in EDEs in Q4. Activity in the euro area continues to be in a contraction mode, though financial market con\ufb01 dence has improved. Japan has embarked on a fresh \ufb01 scal stimulus following contraction in Q3. In the UK, a modest GDP growth in Q3 was followed by a decline in Q4. The HSBC Emerging Market Index rose in Q4. The global composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) also rose marginally in December. 7. According to the IMF, consumer price inflation has eased in both advanced economies (AEs) and EDEs in 2012. However, risks to the in\ufb02 ation outlook from commodity price pressures persist. 8. Year-on-year (y-o-y) real GDP growth slowed from 5.5 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13 to 5.3 per cent in Q2. The decline in the GDP growth rate became broad based, with consumption demand also slowing alongside stalling investment and declining exports. On the supply side, there are indications of weakening resilience of services to sluggish global growth. Looking ahead, there are some 9. tentative signs of a reversal in momentum. While industrial production slowed to a y-o-y increase of 1.0 per cent in April- November 2012, the seasonally adjusted three-month moving average of the index of industrial production (IIP) points to a pick-up. The manufacturing PMI rose in December on the back of higher order book volumes and new export orders. The services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) also rose in December on expectations of a revival of demand. The Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey indicates positive business sentiment in Q3 and Q4. Coverage under rabi sowing has been broadly the same as in the corresponding period of last year. 10. Headline wholesale price index (WPI) in\ufb02 ation eased signi\ufb01 cantly from 8.1 per cent in September 2012 to 7.2 per cent by December. Notably, in\ufb02 ation on account of non-food manufactured products, which have a weight of 55 per cent in the WPI, fell sharply in November- December as input price pressures eased primarily on the back of ebbing metal, non-metallic minerals and chemicals group in\ufb02 ation. The seasonally adjusted three-month moving average annualised in\ufb02 ation also suggests a moderation in headline as well as non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation. With the industrial outlook survey also pointing to softening of the rate of increase of output prices, the pricing power of corporates seems to have weakened. Fuel group inflation moderated in December, mainly re\ufb02 ecting the tempering of in\ufb02 ation of non-administered petroleum products as well as the range-bound exchange rate of the rupee. 11. Food in\ufb02 ation, on the other hand, showed a contrarian behaviour, moving into double digits in December. Significant price pressures emanated from cereals. Prices of pulses and other protein-based food items remained elevated. Furthermore, with the \ufb01 rming up of prices of edible oils and grain mill products, the overall momentum in food in\ufb02 ation remained \ufb01 rm. 12. Inflation based on the new combined (rural and urban) consumer price index (CPI) (Base: 2010=100) rose to 10.6 per cent in December, largely re\ufb02 ecting the surge in food in\ufb02 ation. Excluding food and fuel groups, CPI in\ufb02 ation remained unchanged at 8.4 per cent during Q3. 13. According to the latest Reserve Bank\u2019s urban households\u2019 survey, in\ufb02 ation expectations for Q4 edged up marginally. Wage in\ufb02 ation in rural areas remained high, notwithstanding some recent moderation; as these wage increases have not been accompanied by improvement in productivity, they have imparted in\ufb02 ationary pressures. House price inflation, as measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s quarterly house price index, also remains elevated on a y-o-y basis. 14. Analysis of the early results of corporate performance in Q3 indicates that both sales and expenditure growth moderated while pro\ufb01 t margins remained broadly unchanged. 15. Y-o-y money supply (M3) growth fell to 12.9 per cent by mid-January and remained below the indicative trajectory of 14.0 per cent. This essentially re\ufb02 ected the deceleration of growth in aggregate deposits and moderation in economic activity. 16. Y-o-y non-food credit growth, at 16.2 per cent by mid-January, was around the indicative trajectory. However, bank credit to industry showed a signi\ufb01 cant deceleration while credit to agriculture registered an increase. 17. The estimated total flow of \ufb01 nancial resources to the commercial sector for the current \ufb01 nancial year up to mid-January was `9.6 trillion, higher than `8.1 trillion during the corresponding period last year. This was mainly due to increase in bank credit and subscriptions by non-banks to commercial paper. 18. As regards monetary policy transmission during Q3 of 2012-13, the average term deposit rates of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) declined marginally. Although a few banks reduced their Base Rates modestly during the quarter, the weighted average lending rate as well as the modal Base Rate remained broadly unchanged over the quarter. 19. Liquidity conditions tightened from the second week of November on account of a build-up in the Centre\u2019s cash balances, festival-related lumpy increase in currency demand, and structural pressures brought on by the widening wedge between deposit growth and credit growth. Anticipating liquidity pressures, the Reserve Bank had lowered the cash reserve ratio (CRR) successively in the Mid-Quarter Review (MQR) in September and in the SQR in October. In addition, the Reserve Bank conducted open market operations (OMOs) on \ufb01 ve occasions during December 2012 to January 2013, thereby injecting liquidity of `470 billion into the banking system. Despite these measures, the average net LAF borrowings at `910 billion in January (up to January 27), were above the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level. The government securities 20. (G-Secs) market recorded increased turnover, with yields easing substantially in January. The equity market rose further in Q3 of 2012-13 on account of improved sentiment and pick-up in inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs). 21. Exports contracted in December for the eighth month in succession, re\ufb02 ecting depressed external demand conditions and structural bottlenecks. On the other hand, imports rose on the back of higher oil and gold imports, consequently widening the merchandise trade de\ufb01 cit in Q3 compared to its level a year ago. On top of the large trade de\ufb01 cit, the slowdown in net exports of services and larger out\ufb02 ows of investment income payments is expected to widen the current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD) further in Q3, beyond the level of 5.4 per cent of GDP recorded in Q2 of 2012-13. So far, net capital \ufb02 ows have been 22. suf\ufb01 cient to \ufb01 nance the CAD. Higher net inflows of portfolio investment and accretions to non-resident deposits compensated for lower net external commercial borrowings and foreign direct investment (FDI) into India. Even though net capital flows have been strong, the sheer size of the external \ufb01 nancing requirement imposed by the large CAD has brought to bear downward pressures on the rupee which depreciated in nominal and real terms by January 2013 relative to its level in March 2012. 23. Various measures undertaken by the Government since mid-September, including liberalisation of FDI in retail, aviation, broadcasting and insurance, deferment of general anti-avoidance rules (GAAR), reduction in withholding tax on overseas borrowings by domestic companies and setting up of the Cabinet Committee on Investment have significantly lifted market sentiment which, in due course, should spur investment. Alongside, measures such as progressive deregulation of administered fuel prices, with concerted efforts to adhere to fiscal discipline and carry forward consolidation can potentially correct the twin de\ufb01 cits. These policy actions could help engender stable macroeconomic conditions and return the economy to its high growth trajectory. Further reforms to raise productivity, improve competitiveness and manage the supply constraints, including augmenting energy availability, are crucial for raising the potential growth path in the medium- term. 24. While the improvement in global financial conditions is supportive of global growth prospects for 2013, the recovery is likely to be anaemic and is also fraught with signi\ufb01 cant downside risks. The outlook for AEs generally remains weak. Despite manufacturing stabilising in Q4 of 2012 and forward- looking indicators of services activity showing an uptick, growth in 2013 is most likely to be tepid in view of the persisting drag from high unemployment, continuing deleveraging, financial fragility, persisting sovereign risks and \ufb01 scal tightening, all feeding into one another through negative feedback loops. Breaking out of this downward spiral will depend on resolute structural reforms and credible \ufb01 scal consolidation. For EDEs, weakness in external demand is expected to be a major factor holding back resumption of strong growth in 2013. Taking stock of all this in its latest World Economic Outlook update (January 2013), the IMF revised its forecast of global growth for 2013 downwards to 3.5 per cent from 3.6 per cent projected in October 2012. In\ufb02 ation rates remain subdued in 25. most AEs, re\ufb02 ecting large output gaps and downward pressure on wages. Although in\ufb02 ation receded in a majority of EDEs during 2012, it remained stubbornly high in South Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. Elevated oil prices and country-speci\ufb01 c supply-side constraints may continue to put upward pressure on in\ufb02 ation in EDEs through 2014. Given the subdued global demand, the IMF forecasts oil prices to somewhat soften in 2013. However, there are upside risks from geo-political factors and supply disruptions. 26. The Reserve Bank\u2019s projection of GDP growth for 2012-13 in the First Quarter Review (FQR) of July 2012 was 6.5 per cent. In the SQR of October, this was revised downwards to 5.8 per cent, signalling increasing global risks as well as accentuated domestic risks on account of halted investment demand, moderation in consumption spending and erosion in export performance. Since then, industrial activity has remained subdued. Sluggish external demand continues to inhibit improvement in services. While the coverage of rabi sowing has picked up, severe winter in certain parts has endangered crop prospects. New investment demand, which should be the key driver of the upturn, continues to be weak. While the series of policy initiatives by the Government has boosted market sentiment, it will take some time to reverse the investment slowdown and reinvigorate growth. Accordingly, the baseline projection of GDP growth for 2012-13 is revised down from 5.8 per cent given in the SQR to 5.5 per cent (Chart 1). 27. The substantial easing of non- food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation over Q3 in an environment of slower growth and excess capacity in some sectors suggests that in\ufb02 ation has come off its peak. However, it is expected to be range-bound around current levels due to persisting food in\ufb02 ation, the pass- through of diesel price adjustments over the next several months and the 7 27. The substantial easing of non- food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation over Q3 in an environment of slower growth and excess capacity in some sectors suggests that in\ufb02 ation has come off its peak. However, it is expected to be range-bound around current levels due to persisting food in\ufb02 ation, the pass- through of diesel price adjustments over the next several months and the 7 28. Although in\ufb02 ation has remained persistently high over the past two years, it is important to note that during the 2000s, it averaged around 5.5 per cent, both in terms of WPI and CPI, down from its earlier trend rate of about 7.5 per cent. Given this record, the conduct of monetary policy will continue to condition and contain perception of in\ufb02 ation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent. This is in line with the medium-term objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent with India\u2019s broader integration into the global economy. Monetary Aggregates 29. Money supply (M3) growth has been below its indicative trajectory for 2012-13 so far, while non-food credit growth has been around the projection. Keeping in view the seasonal pattern for the last quarter, M3 growth projection for 2012-13 has been scaled down to 13.0 per cent from 14.0 per cent while non- food credit growth projection is retained at 16.0 per cent. These numbers, as always, are indicative projections and not targets. 30. Macroeconomic management going forward is subject to a number of risks as indicated below: i) Domestically, the widening of the CAD to historically high levels in the context of a large \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit and slowing growth exposes the economy to the risks from twin de\ufb01 cits. Financing the CAD with increasingly risky and volatile \ufb02 ows increases the economy\u2019s vulnerability to sudden shifts in risk appetite and liquidity preference, t h r e a t e n i n g p o t e n t i a l l y macroeconomic and exchange rate stability. Large \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cits will accentuate the CAD risk, further crowd out private investment and stunt growth impulses. ii) Global risks remain elevated, with the potential for spillovers on the Indian economy through trade, \ufb01 nance and con\ufb01 dence channels. In the US, the risk of political inaction to manage the debt ceiling or even a sudden onset of \ufb01 scal austerity can lead to turmoil in \ufb01 nancial markets, followed by a downturn in economic activity. Escalation of the euro area sovereign debt stress in view of the continuing absence of credible and comprehensive policy responses remains a contingent global risk, along with geopolitical tensions that can adversely impact supplies/ prices of key commodities, particularly of crude oil. These forces can potentially increase global risk aversion with implications for \ufb01 nancing of the CAD. iii) In\ufb02 ation over the last three years has been a result of demand pressures as well as supply constraints. With demand pressures now on the ebb, the supply constraints need to be urgently addressed. This will require developing an adequate, credible and flexible supply response in respect of those commodities and segments of the economy characterised by structural imbalances. In the absence of an effective supply response, in\ufb02 ationary pressures may return and persist with adverse implications for macroeconomic stability. The key to stimulating growth is a vigorous and sustained revival in investment. Achieving this will, however, depend on a number of factors such as bridging the infrastructure gaps, especially in power and transport, hastening approvals, removing procedural bottlenecks, and improving governance. v) Risk aversion in the banking system stemming from concerns relating to asset quality is constraining credit flow. Notwithstanding the importance of repairing asset quality, banks should be discerning in their loan decisions and ensure adequate credit \ufb02 ow to productive sectors of the economy. 31. Since October 2011, the stance of monetary policy shifted to addressing increasing growth risks as re\ufb02 ected in the slowing down of the economy. The monetary policy response was, however, constrained because of inflation broadening and persisting at a level much above what is conducive for sustained growth. The risk of expectations getting entrenched in the event of a premature change in the policy stance was significant. Notwithstanding the constraints, the CRR was reduced cumulatively by 125 basis points during January-March 2012 to prepare liquidity conditions for a front-loaded 50 basis points reduction in the policy repo rate in April. However, the Reserve Bank had to pause in its policy rate reduction as the expected complementary policy actions towards \ufb01 scal adjustment and improving the investment climate did not follow, and inflation risks persisted. Nevertheless, the Reserve Bank persevered with efforts to ease credit and liquidity conditions through a 100 basis points reduction in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) in July and a cumulative 50 basis points reduction in the CRR during September-October. this review is shaped by two major considerations. 33. First, headline WPI in\ufb02 ation and its momentum edged down in November- December on the back of softening of non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation, even though food in\ufb02 ation has risen, adversely impacting households\u2019 inflation expectations. The staggered increase in diesel prices announced earlier this month will percolate through to overall costs and in\ufb02 ation; however, these price pressures will dissipate over time, and the consequent reduction entailed in the \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit will bring about an enduring reduction in in\ufb02 ation and in\ufb02 ation expectations. At the same time, still high input costs and wages continue to impart upward pressures on prices. Accordingly, it is critical that even as the monetary policy stance shifts further towards mitigating growth risks, the objective of containing in\ufb02 ation and anchoring in\ufb02 ation expectations is not de-emphasised. Second, growth has decelerated 34. significantly below trend through 2011-12 and 2012-13 so far and overall economic activity remains subdued. On the demand side, investment activity has been way below desired levels and consumption demand has started to decelerate. External demand has also 32. Against this backdrop of global and domestic macroeconomic conditions, outlook and risks, the policy stance in weakened due to the slowdown in global growth. On the supply side, constraints in the availability of key raw materials and intermediates are becoming binding. In turn, this is being reflected in a widening of the CAD with adverse implications for external sustainability. While the monetary policy stance has sought to balance the growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamic through calibrated easing, it is critical now to arrest the loss of growth momentum without endangering external stability. The moderation in in\ufb02 ation conditions provides the opportunity for monetary policy to act in conjunction with \ufb01 scal and other measures to stem the growth risks. 35. Against this backdrop, the stance of monetary policy in this review is intended to: \uf020 provide an appropriate interest rate environment to support growth as in\ufb02 ation risks moderate; \uf020 \uf020 continue to manage liquidity to ensure adequate \ufb02 ow of credit to the productive sectors of the econom y. 36. On the basis of current assessment and in line with the policy stance outlined in Section III, the Reserve Bank announces the following policy measures: Repo Rate It has been decided to: \uf020 reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 8.0 per cent to 7.75 per cent with immediate effect. 39. The Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate, determined with a spread of 100 basis points above the repo rate, stands adjusted to 8.75 per cent with immediate effect. Bank Rate 40. 8.75 per cent with immediate effect. The Bank Rate stands adjusted to The reverse repo rate under the 38. LAF, determined with a spread of 100 basis points below the repo rate, stands adjusted to 6.75 per cent with immediate effect. \uf020 It has been decided to: reduce the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks by 25 basis points from 4.25 per cent to 4.0 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) effective the fortnight beginning February 9, 2013. 42. As a result of this reduction in the CRR, around `180 billion of primary liquidity will be injected into the banking system. Guidance 43. With headline in\ufb02 ation likely to have peaked and non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation declining steadily over the last few months, there is an increasing likelihood of in\ufb02 ation remaining range- bound around current levels going into 2013-14. This provides space, albeit limited, for monetary policy to give greater emphasis to growth risks. The above policy guidance will, however, be conditioned by the evolving growth- in\ufb02 ation dynamic and the management of risks from twin de\ufb01 cits. 44. The policy actions and the guidance in this Statement given are expected to: support growth by encouraging investment; ii) continue to anchor medium-term in\ufb02 ation expectations on the basis of a credible commitment to low and stable in\ufb02 ation; and iii) improve liquidity conditions to The next mid-quarter review of 45. Monetary Policy for 2012-13 will be announced through a press release on Tuesday, March 19, 2013. 46. is scheduled on Friday, May 3, 2013. ", "file8": "Global growth likely to stay sluggish in 2013 Global growth turned weaker in 2012 4. and is expected to stay sluggish in 2013 as \ufb01 scal adjustments drag growth in advanced economies (AEs) and, in turn, delay cyclical recovery in emerging market and developing economies International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its World Economic Outlook has forecast global growth to stay sluggish at 3.3 per cent in 2013 before improving to 4.0 per cent in 2014. While downside tail risks have reduced in early 2013 because of the supportive policy action in the euro area and the measures to tackle the \ufb01 scal cliff in the US, risks to global recovery have increased consequent to the Chinese economy slowing down. Global commodity price in\ufb02 ation likely to remain soft, although with some risks from QE 5. The outlook for global commodity prices during 2013 remains benign, with a further decline expected in metal and oil prices. This should help reduce imported in\ufb02 ation in the domestic economy, subject to prevalence of stable exchange rate movements. However, global commodity price in\ufb02 ation risks remain from the large and continuous doses of quantitative easing (QE). Global \ufb01 nancial markets bolstered by policy actions aimed at reducing tail risks Notwithstanding weak global growth the imposed US and in the euro area, international \ufb01 nancial markets gained traction following unconventional monetary easing. However, this has not translated into growth revival. Although the tail risks have reduced, they for committed remain signi\ufb01 cant, calling action to trim the balance sheet exposures and prepare adequate buffers against possible contagion effects. Slow-paced recovery likely to shape 2013- 14 The Indian economy remained sluggish 7. in Q3 of 2012-13, with slowdown turning visibly pervasive across most sectors. The deceleration in the services sector growth, which has been the mainstay of high growth in the recent period, had dragged down overall economic activity and employment creation. The agriculture output was dented by de\ufb01 cient rainfall that impacted kharif crop. Domestic policy uncertainties, governance concerns, the impact of earlier monetary tightening and the slacking of external demand continue to adversely impact growth. Resolving structural bottlenecks and providing public investment stimulus can turnaround falling investment the slowdown, a public investment stimulus balanced with offsetting reductions in current expenditures, along with concerted action to remove supply-side bottlenecks, are needed to shape the revival of the economy. Sustained efforts needed to reduce the CAD, though fall in global commodity prices brings temporary respite Aggregate demand remained sluggish 8. during Q3 of 2012-13 with in\ufb02 ation impacting real consumption and cyclical and structural factors affecting investment. Corporate results suggest weak demand, with moderation in investment as well as consumption. Government consumption expenditure has re\ufb02 ecting expenditure-cutting decelerated, as part of its \ufb01 scal consolidation strategy. Corporate data on planned \ufb01 xed investments indicate further during Q3 of 2012-13. Given the intensity of investment slowed (OMOs). Also, `1.3 trillion of primary liquidity was infused through cuts in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) since January 2012. Further liquidity requirements were met through LAF repos. Strong FII \ufb02 ows augured well for the Indian rupee and equity market recorded in the preceding year. The year-end in\ufb02 ation turned out to be even lower at 6.0 per cent. However, consumer price in\ufb02 ation stays in the double digits, re\ufb02 ecting substantially food in\ufb02 ation pressures. Headline in\ufb02 ation in 2013-14 is likely to exhibit a downward bias on account of expected lower global commodity prices, but face an upward bias from signi\ufb01 cant pass-through from suppressed in\ufb02 ation. Slow-paced recovery, range-bound in\ufb02 ation and macro-\ufb01 nancial risks require a cautious monetary policy response Growth decelerated further during Q3 of 2012-13, with the slowdown extending to services sector, which has been the mainstay of India\u2019s high growth. Mining and manufacturing activity continued to stall while agriculture output was impacted by de\ufb01 cient rainfall during the monsoon season. Domestic policy uncertainties, sluggish external demand and the lagged impact of the earlier monetary tightening policy reduced growth. Global growth decelerated during 2012 and is expected to remain weak during 2013 also. As business sentiments remain weak and structural impediments still constrain activity levels, recovery during 2013-14 may be modest. Global growth likely to remain weak in 2013 I.1 Global growth turned weaker in 2012 with slack external demand in advanced economies (AEs) adversely impacting growth in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Activity levels are expected to stay weak in 2013 as \ufb01 scal adjustments drag growth in AEs and, in turn, delay cyclical recovery in EMDEs. I.2 In its April 2013 World Economic Outlook (WEO), the IMF has forecasted global growth to stay subdued at 3.3 per cent in 2013, down by 0.2 percentage points from its January 2013 projections. The IMF expects global growth to pick up to 4.0 per cent in 2014 on the strength of the anticipated sharper recovery in the US. I.3 Recent information suggest that global growth has stayed subdued although with slight improvement during Q1 of 2013. The US growth accelerated to 2.5 per cent (seasonally adjusted annualised quarter-on-quarter growth rate, q-o-q saar) in Q1 of 2013 from 0.4 per cent in Q4 of 2012, but was below market expectation. Japan\u2019s GDP remained \ufb02 at in Q4 of 2012, after two quarters of contraction. The euro area remained in a contraction mode, with the pace of contraction increasing to 2.3 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q4 of 2012 from 0.3 per cent in Q3 (Chart I.1a). The UK narrowly avoided a triple dip recession in Q1 of 2013 by expanding at 1.2 per cent (q-o-q, saar) after contracting by the same rate in Q4 of 2012. I.4 The expected loss of growth and employment in the US due to its budget sequestration may prove to be a drag on global economic expansion during 2013. According to the US Congressional Budget Of\ufb01 ce (CBO), fiscal tightening will knock out about 1.5 percentage points from US GDP growth in 2013. 1.5 The US economy job gains have brought the unemployment rate to a four-year low of 7.6 per cent in March 2013, while euro area unemployment rate remained at a record level of 12 per cent in February 2013. growth remained listless. Overall, growth continued to remain below trend for the sixth consecutive quarter since Q2 of 2011-12 (Chart I.2). The momentum indicator corroborates the slowdown (Chart I.3). I.6 With the Chinese economy slowing down risks to global recovery have increased. Growth in China was around 7.8 per cent in 2012 and has declined to 6.6 per cent (q-o-q, saar) in Q1 of 2013. Brazil and South Africa have shown some improvement in their GDP growth in Q4 of 2012 (Chart I.1b). I.7 Consequent to the slow global growth, world trade remained subdued for most of 2012 and in 2013 so far (see Chapter 3). I.8 During 2012-13, the Indian economy continued to witness slowdown for the third quarter in succession (Table I.1). GDP growth in Q3 of 2012-13 at 4.5 per cent has been the lowest since Q4 of 2008-09 (3.5 per cent). The decline in the growth rate was seen in the agriculture and services sectors, while industrial I.9 While the moderation of growth in agriculture was largely on account of the rainfall deficiency, the slowdown in industry and services reflected several factors including domestic policy uncertainties, lagged impact of earlier monetary tightening and slackening of external demand. The sharp deterioration in the services sector in Q3 of 2012-13 over Q3 of the previous year was mainly re\ufb02 ected under \u2018trade, hotels, transport and communication\u2019 and \u2018\ufb01 nancing, insurance, real estate and business services\u2019. These sub-sectors slowed down in line with the slowdown of activity in industry and agriculture as also in the external sector. Sector-specific problems, such as those in communications, aggravated the slowdown. I.10 The extension of the slowdown to the services sector, the main driver of India\u2019s high growth, merits close attention. The quarterly 2.1 Mining & quarrying AE: Advance Estimates. Source: Central Statistics Of\ufb01 ce. GDP of the services sector excluding community, social and personal services during the period 1997-98 to 2012-13 indicates two structural breaks in its growth series (Chart I.4). These breaks also indicate that current slowdown in the services sector starting since Q2 of 2008-09 has pulled down the sectors\u2019 mean growth to about the level prior to Q2 of 2003-04. Trade, telecommunications, transport by means other than railways and construction activity have been particularly impacted in the current cycle. Deficient rainfall affects agricultural output I.11 De\ufb01 ciency and uneven distribution of rainfall during July-August 2012 dented kharif sowing in 2012 and impacted the production of foodgrains and commercial crops. The recovery of rainfall from September onward helped maintain soil moisture during the rabi season. The production of rabi oilseeds and coarse cereals has improved and rabi pulses are poised for record production during 2012- 13. However, the production of wheat is expected to decline during 2012-13, mainly due to the smaller area covered under the crop. The decline in production of foodgrains during 2012-13 is estimated at only 3.5 per cent (Table I.2). I.12 The current stock of foodgrains (59.7 million tonnes at end-March 2013) is suf\ufb01 cient to meet the buffer norms and requirements under the various poverty alleviation schemes. In view of the pace at which food stocks are building up, i.e., around 27 per cent per annum in the costs and moderation of external demand (Table I.3). Contraction in capital goods and the mining sector continue to affect the overall performance of the industrial sector (Chart I.5). Excluding the volatile items, the truncated IIP (96 per cent of IIP) growth in April-February 2012-13 is 1.5 per cent. #: Million bales of 170 kgs each. # #: Million bales of 180 kgs each. past five years, there is a need for better management of the food stock in order to dampen cereal in\ufb02 ation. I.14 The growth of the manufacturing sector remained highly concentrated. Of the 22-major industry groups, the fastest growing top \ufb01 ve manufacturing industries had the largest contribution of about 169 per cent to the overall growth of the manufacturing sector during April-February 2012-13 (Chart 1.6). Bottom 17 industries had a negative contribution of 72 per cent. Major industries that registered contraction in output included motor vehicles, electrical machinery & apparatus, machinery & equipment and fabricated metal products. Industrial growth is stagnating, but could improve ahead I.13 Growth in the index of industrial production (IIP) witnessed a slowdown to 0.9 per cent during April-February 2012-13, largely due to infrastructure and input constraints, rising I.15 Shortage of power was a major constraining factor for the growth of the industrial sector. Growth in electricity generation decelerated during 2012-13 to 4.0 per cent from 8.2 per cent in the year before. The gap between requirement and availability of power increased to 8.7 per cent during the period. Shortages in P: Provisional. #: Figures may not add up to 100 due to rounding off. Source: Central Statistics Of\ufb01 ce. coal supply, delays in capacity addition and a delayed and skewed monsoon have contributed to the slower growth of power generation. I.16 Capital goods output continued to contract, reflecting a subdued investment climate. The slowdown in economic activity and consumption demand has resulted in moderation in the growth of consumer goods. I.17 Apart from domestic constraints, weak global growth was also responsible for the domestic industrial slowdown given the strong co-movement between the domestic and global IIP, with a statistically signi\ufb01 cant correlation coef\ufb01 cient of 0.7 for the period April 2008 to February 2013 (Chart 1.7). Structural bottlenecks affect growth of core industries I.18 Core industries are faced with various supply constraints, such as shortage of coal and natural gas, stoppage of mining in some states and delays in commissioning of large projects. Consequently, the growth of eight core industries decelerated to 2.6 per cent during April- February 2012-13 compared to 5.2 per cent during the corresponding period last year. The production of electricity and steel recorded sharp deceleration (Chart I.8). The pick-up in the industrial sector is contingent upon a tangible turnaround in the performance of the core industries. Capacity Utilisation remained \ufb02 at I.19 Capacity utilisation, as measured by the 20th Round of the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank, remained around the previous quarter\u2019s level during Q3 of 2012-13 (http:// www.rbi.org.in/OBICUS20). There is broad co-movement between capacity utilisation and the de-trended IIP \u2013 Manufacturing (Chart I.9). After sequential lowering in the previous two quarters, new orders picked up marginally in Q3 of 2012-13; however, its growth remained lower than in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The \ufb01 nished goods inventory to sales ratio reached its lowest level in the past \ufb01 ve quarters, whereas the raw material inventory to sales ratio surged further to reach its highest level in \ufb01 ve quarters. Services sector witnesses moderation in growth I.20 Weak global growth coupled with the slowdown in domestic consumption has adversely affected the performance of the services sector. Several indicators of the services sector activity show a slowdown in their activity during April-February 2012-13 (Table I.4). The Reserve Bank\u2019s services sector composite indicator based on growth in indicators of construction, trade and transport and finance, showed a continuation of the downturn in services in Q3 of 2012-13, but indicated slight improvement during January- February of 2013 (Chart I.10). Employment scenario remained weak during April-December 2012-13 I.21 The weak employment scenario that started from Q4 of 2011-12 still continues. As per the Labour Bureau survey, employment creation in the eight key sectors during 2012-13 (April-December) declined by 68 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year, largely due to the IT/BPO sector, which is one of the main contributors to employment generation in the organised sector.

Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Ministry of Tourism, Press Information Bureau, Indian Ports Association, SIAM and CMIE. textiles and leather, all other sectors have also shown a decline in the rate of employment generation (Table I.5). Growth likely to have stayed low in Q4 of 2012-13, recovery in 2013-14 contingent on addressing supply bottlenecks I.22 Given the continued dismal performance of industry and evidence of a slowdown in services, growth is likely to have remained subdued in Q4 of 2012-13. Going forward, sustained efforts by the government to expediting environmental clearances and land acquisition are needed to turnaround growth in core industries. I.23 Constraints facing the infrastructure sector need to be addressed. The Reserve Bank, on its part, has also recently relaxed the norms for external commercial borrowings for infrastructural \ufb01 nance companies and has eased the norms for treating bank loans to public private partnership (PPP) projects as secured \ufb01 nance subject to conditions. On the global front, a meaningful recovery in euro area is likely to take somewhat longer. In this environment, growth in India is excepted to remain below potential for the third year in succession during 2013-14. Aggregate demand in the economy remained sluggish during Q3 of 2012-13 with a prolongation of the investment cycle downturn and some weakness in consumption. Corporate results show that sales continued to decelerate suggesting slack in both inventory and consumption demand. Government consumption expenditure also decelerated in response to the \ufb01 scal consolidation plan. Going forward, some improvement in consumption demand is likely if in\ufb02 ation recedes further. Also, investment demand could turnaround if government initiatives to resolve structural bottlenecks that impede investment fructify. A public investment stimulus is needed to revive demand, but it is important to \ufb01 rst create the \ufb01 scal space for it by cutting current expenditure. Aggregate demand remained sluggish II.1 Expenditure-side GDP data suggest that aggregate demand remained sluggish during Q3 of 2012-13, with weak expansion in private and government consumption expenditure. Corporate results reaf\ufb01 rm this, as sales growth continued to decelerate during Q3 of 2012-13, re\ufb02 ecting investment slack as well as some weakness in consumption demand. Further, planned corporate investments as gleaned from the phasing details of projects receiving financial assistance from banks and other \ufb01 nancial institutions suggest that corporate \ufb01 xed investments dropped in Q3 of 2012-13. II.2 Growth in GDP at market prices remained low with notable deceleration in government consumption expenditure (Table II.1). The contribution to modest growth in Q3 largely came from private consumption and investment (Table II.2). II.3 Revival of investment has become a major macro-economic challenge at the current juncture. Monetary policy easing in 2012-13 has not succeeded in turning around investment. The logjam associated with structural bottlenecks in the mining and infrastructure space persist and need to be resolved \ufb01 rst. Otherwise, the limited available space for monetary policy could get quickly used up without stimulating aggregate demand and real activity. Decline in saving and investment rates a concern II.4 Both saving and investment rates declined in 2011-12 (Table II.3). All three sectors, viz., households, private and public sectors have witnessed a slowdown in saving during this period. Within household saving, while the \ufb01 nancial saving rate declined, physical saving rate increased as households turned to physical assets as inflation hedges. The persistence of in\ufb02 ation with average headline FRE : First Revised Estimates. SRE : Second Revised Estimates. TRE: Third Revised Estimates. ##: Adjusted for errors and omissions. Source: Central Statistics Of\ufb01 ce. in\ufb02 ation of about 9 per cent during 2011-12 withered financial savings, as households attempted to stave off the downward pressure on their real consumption. II.5 The decline in the rate of investment in 2011-12 was mainly due to decline in the investment rate of the private corporate sector followed by that of the public sector even as the household investment rate increased. The increase in investment in valuables continued in 2011-12 and exhibited a sharper rise, partly contributing to the high Current Account De\ufb01 cit (CAD) in 2011-12. Urgency of addressing infrastructural bottlenecks in various sectors to revive growth II.6 As on January 1, 2013, nearly half of the 566 central sector projects (of `1.5 billion and above) are delayed and there have been cost overruns to the tune of 18 per cent. The sectors that have been affected by cost and time overruns are railways, water resources, petro chemicals, road transport & highways and power. Several factors that affect the progress of projects are delays in regulatory approvals, land acquisition, land/site handover, lack of strong rehabilitation and resettlement policies, delays in decision-making, weak/ineffective project planning and monitoring and contractual disputes. II.7 The multiplicity of authorities involved in project clearances continue to constrain investment and, therefore, the numerous government initiatives have had limited bene\ufb01 ts. Recognising this, several initiatives have been taken for speedy clearance of projects. These include setting up Standing Committees in the Ministries to \ufb01 x responsibility for time and cost overruns, regular reviews of infrastructure projects by the concerned administrative Ministries and setting up Central Sector Project Co-ordination Committees in the States under the Chief Secretaries. A Cabinet Committee on Investment was also constituted in December 2012 to examine issues relating to clearances/approvals of major projects to ensure their accelerated and timely implementation. II.8 The roads sector\u2019s progress has recently been tardy due to delays in pre-construction activities such as land acquisition, shifting of utilities and, forest and environment clearances. In fact, during 2012-13 only 1,933 km of road projects (6,491 km in 2011-12) were awarded by the government. Even the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts, in which the government bears the cost of projects, have faced problems in attracting bids due to delays in procedural approvals. In this context, the Supreme Court judgement of March 2013 on delinking the environment from forest clearances for highway projects should come as a big boost to the sector. The Union Budget 2013-14 has also announced the setting up of a regulatory authority for the roads sector. II.9 The power sector has been largely affected by the shortage of coal and gas, which led to cutbacks in electricity generation. The gap between demand and supply of coal continues to diverge and is likely to widen further during the Twelfth Plan, which in turn, may affect several power projects. On the one hand, more expensive imported coal may erode the pro\ufb01 t margins of the producers, and on the other hand, several State Electricity Boards are supplying electricity at less than break-even price. Urgent policy intervention to augment coal supplies is necessary to sustain power sector investments. II.10 Private investments in railways have been low. A renewed focus on PPP could boost investment and help railways in furthering the rather challenging Twelfth Plan investment targets of `1 trillion through this route. Investment in near term can get kicked in from the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor. II.11 Telecommunication, another key infrastructure sector, has also been struggling over the past few years due to various issues. The sector, which was growing at an average rate of 24 per cent during the 2000s, slowed to 8 per cent in 2011-12. Issues such as shortage of spectrum, its pricing and the principle underlying the auction process, changes in tax rules have dampened the outlook for the sector. Presently, almost all telecom operators are facing huge debt burden and cash \ufb02 ow issues. Moderation in sales growth continued and pro\ufb01 t margins were lower II.12 Sales growth for listed Non-Government Non-Financial (NGNF) companies moderated in Q3 of 2012-13 to its lowest level since Q3 of 2009-10. Deceleration in sales was observed across manufacturing, IT and non-IT services sector, with a few exceptions such as jewellery, real estate, motor vehicles and other transport equipments. However, operating profit (EBITDA) grew at a positive rate for the second consecutive quarter, reversing the trend of the previous four quarters (Table II.4). Inventory accumulation, as re\ufb02 ected in the change in stock-in-trade to sales ratio was lower in Q3 of 2012-13, reversing the pick-up seen in Q2 of 2012-13 (Chart II.1). Net pro\ufb01 t declined sharply during Q3 on a q-o-q basis (Table II.5). Analyst guidance for Q4 of 2012-13 suggests flat Fresh investment proposals declined further II.13 Planned corporate investment, based on the total expenditure of projects for which assiatance was sanctioned by major banks/FIs, #: For companies reporting this item explicitly. *: Other income excludes extraordinary income/expenditure if reported explicitly. **: Some companies report interest on net basis. moderated sharply in Q3 of 2012-13, reversing the increase observed in Q2 of 2012-13 (Table II.6). Most of the planned investements were in the power and cement sectors during Q3 of 2012-13 (Chart II.2). Momentum towards \ufb01 scal consolidation continues II.14 Faced with the challenge of twin de\ufb01 cits, the government embarked on a fiscal consolidation plan with mid-year correction in 2012-13. The containment of GFD at 5.2 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 (RE) in the face of shortfalls in tax revenues, telecommunication receipts and disinvestment proceeds was largely brought about by scaling down plan and capital expenditures. There was, however, a slippage in achieving the budgeted revenue de\ufb01 cit-GDP ratio of 3.4 per cent, re\ufb02 ecting the impact of a sharp rise in non-plan revenue expenditure, particularly subsidies, coupled with shortfall in revenue receipts (both tax and non-tax) during the year (Table II.7). Note: Based on data reported by 39 banks/FIs. * : Data is provisional ** : Q3:2012-13 data is based on reported \ufb01 gures from 30 banks/FIs. Corresponding data for Q2:2012-13 and Q3: 2011-12 are given in parentheses. continuation of fiscal consolidation efforts would signi\ufb01 cantly enhance sustainable growth and better balance the aggregate demand by helping to revive investment. Importantly, the envisaged \ufb01 scal correction is expected to be achieved through a reduction of 0.6 percentage points in the revenue deficit-GDP ratio. Notwithstanding the envisaged \ufb01 scal correction, the budgeted key \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cits for 2013-14 are higher than the path set out by the Committee on Roadmap for Fiscal Consolidation (Chairman: Dr. Vijay L. Kelkar). As the \ufb01 scal consolidation efforts are primarily revenue-led, it is crucial for a revival in investment climate and growth to ensure the achievement of \ufb01 scal consolidation II.15 During 2013-14, the gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit- GDP ratio is budgeted to decline further to 4.8 per cent. Over the medium to long run, the from financial public sector undertakings (PSUs) and receipts from the telecommunications sector. Among non-debt capital receipts, disinvestment receipts are budgeted at a substantially higher level compared to the previous year. Non-plan expenditure growth to moderate in 2013-14 II.18 During 2012-13 (RE), the total expenditure grew faster than the previous year (Table II.8). It is budgeted to accelerate further in 2013-14. Total budgeted expenditure at 14.6 per cent of GDP is higher than the Kelkar Committee target of 13.9 per cent. Among the expenditure components, the projected growth in capital expenditure at 36.6 per cent and plan expenditure at 29.4 per cent, if achieved,could help augment aggregate investment in the economy. RE: Revised Estimates. BE: Budget Estimates. Note: 1. Negative sign (-) indicates surplus in de\ufb01 cit indicators. Tax-GDP ratio remains low in 2012-13, but expected to go up in 2013-14 II.16 Gross tax revenues in 2012-13 (RE) were lower than the budgeted level by 3.7 per cent because of decline in collection from Union excise duties, customs duties, corporation tax and wealth tax, although income tax and service tax collections showed an improvement. However, with the expected growth of 19.1 per cent in tax revenues, the gross tax-GDP ratio is estimated to improve by 0.5 percentage points to 10.9 per cent during 2013-14. The increase in tax revenues is sought to be achieved through higher excise and custom duties on certain products and the imposition of an additional surcharge on high-income individuals. II.17 The growth in non-tax revenues is budgeted at 32.8 per cent, mainly on account of a substantial increase in dividends and pro\ufb01 ts II.19 The growth in non-plan revenue expenditure is budgeted to be contained at 8.0 per cent as against a growth of 13.3 per cent in 2012-13. The restraint on non-plan revenue expenditure growth is critical to ensure that the fiscal consolidation is sustainable, and not excessively reliant on revenue augmentation. The expenditure on subsidies is budgeted at 2.0 per cent of GDP in 2013-14 as against 2.6 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 (Table II.9). The phased deregulation of diesel prices as announced by the Government would reduce petroleum subsidies and the softening of fertiliser prices in the international market together with urea price revisions, if any, may help to keep fertiliser subsidy bill under control. However, there could be a risk of slippage in adhering to the budget estimates of food subsidy expenditure. II.20 Although plan expenditure has decelerated to 4.1 per cent in 2012-13 (RE), it is budgeted to register a signi\ufb01 cant increase of 29.4 per cent in 2013-14. Planned capital expenditure in 2012-13 was lower by 14.6 per cent over the budgeted amount and registered a 9.1 per cent y-o-y growth. On this low base, it is budgeted to expand by 30.6 per cent in 2013-14. The Per cent to GDP Memo : 10. Revenue De\ufb01 cit 11. Effective Revenue De\ufb01 cit 12. Gross Fiscal De\ufb01 cit 13.

BE: Budget Estimates. Source: Union Budget 2013-14. II.22 On the whole, the \ufb01 scal consolidation measures announced in the budget for 2013-14 may lay the foundation for a sustainable rebalancing of government \ufb01 nances. If budgetary targets are adhered to, it will enhance the credibility of the \ufb01 scal management, impart con\ufb01 dence among investors, lower risk premia on India and support growth revival. However, over the medium-term, the focus on eliminating the effective revenue de\ufb01 cit by 2015-16 would be critical to \ufb01 scal policy strategy as it could create space for counter-cyclical policies to support capital formation and growth. External imbalances came to the fore during 2012-13 as the CAD-GDP ratio reached an all time high of 6.7 per cent in Q3 mainly on account of the growing trade de\ufb01 cit. Although non-oil non-gold imports have decelerated in recent months, the sticky oil and gold imports resulted in the widening of trade de\ufb01 cit. However, the overall balance of payments was in marginal surplus due to strong capital in\ufb02 ows, led by FII investments. In Q4 of 2012-13, CAD is expected to have narrowed on the back of a turnaround in export growth and stabilisation of import growth. The recent moderation in commodity prices, including oil and gold will also help reduce the pressure on the current account. Despite these factors, the CAD is likely to remain above sustainable level. This requires policy attention, as the lumpiness and volatility of capital \ufb02 ows expose CAD \ufb01 nancing to risks of sudden stops and reversals in these \ufb02 ows. III.1 During 2012, global trade expanded at its slowest pace since the mid-1990s with the exception of a large contraction in 2009. Slow growth in the advanced economies (AEs) continued to remain a weak link in global trade expansion, while emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) seem to be contributing to global trade through increased intra-industry and South-South trade. The upturn in world exports in Q4 of 2012, though small, was largely supported by the relatively better growth performance in EMDEs, while exports from AEs showed contraction (Chart III.1). Going forward, the lower-than-expected growth in China in Q1 of 2013 comes as a dampener, and tilts towards downside the overall balance of risks to the global economic and trade outlook. III.2 Re\ufb02 ecting the modest increase in trade activities across EMDEs, India\u2019s merchandise exports showed a turnaround from December 2012 after a subdued performance in previous months (Table III.1 and Chart III.2a). In Q4 of 2012-13, export growth at 4.7 per cent was higher compared with 4.0 per cent in the corresponding period of 2011-12. While the recovery in exports in January 2013 was mainly due to higher demand from Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and a few African economies, the exports to China continued to contract. Commodity-wise data show that export pick-up was confined to a few sectors. Petroleum products, oil cakes, gems and jewellery, engineering goods and cotton yarn accounted for more than 75 per cent of the total rise in exports in Q4 of 2012-13. III.3 Notwithstanding a modest increase in exports in recent months, the trade deficit remained signi\ufb01 cantly higher in 2012-13. In fact, the non-oil non-gold trade balance has shown an improvement since November 2012, turning mildly positive in February 2013 (Chart III.2b). Net imports of POL and gold accounted for nearly 82 per cent of India\u2019s trade de\ufb01 cit during 2012-13. III.4 In the recent period, the government undertook a slew of measures to address the high trade de\ufb01 cit attributed to low exports and imports and its impact on India\u2019s CAD, the Union Budget 2013-14 emphasised that the household sector must be incentivised to save in \ufb01 nancial instruments rather than buy gold and hence, proposed various measures including the introduction of in\ufb02 ation-indexed bonds. high POL and gold imports. In January 2013, the government authorised oil marketing companies to hike diesel prices on a monthly basis, thereby allowing gradual deregulation of diesel prices. CAD risks may moderate in the near term, though structural impediments remain The current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD) rose III.6 to a historical high of 6.7 per cent of GDP in Q3 of 2012-13 (Table III.2). On BoP basis, merchandise exports remained almost stagnant at level achieved in Q3 of 2011-12. Though, sluggish global demand has largely been responsible for continued weak exports, there is a need to address domestic policy issues impeding export growth. For example, despite being one of the major coal producers in the world, India had to import 113 million tonnes during the period April 2012-January 2013, which is a jump of 29 per cent, on top of a rise of 47 per cent witnessed during the previous year. In 2012-13, diesel consumption increased by 6.8 per cent over 2011-12. III.5 To curb the import demand for gold, the customs duty on gold import was raised further from 4 per cent to 6 per cent in January 2013. Under the Gold Deposit Scheme, the central government has allowed mutual funds / ETFs to deposit part of their gold with the banks. Recognising the concerns relating to high gold III.7 Other major sources of current receipts, viz., exports of services, most notably software, and private transfers also decelerated and were thus inadequate to offset the impact of the high trade de\ufb01 cit on the current account balance. Non-oil non-gold imports have continued to decelerate, broadly tracking the slowdown in GDP growth (Chart III.3). In contrast, despite of which: Change in Reserves* 14.

P: Preliminary; PR: Partially Revised various dampening factors such as slowdown in growth, depreciation of the rupee and policy measures like duty hike on gold, the demand for oil and gold imports has remained signi\ufb01 cant. III.9 While the CAD, even at this large level, could be fully \ufb01 nanced by capital in\ufb02 ows during 2012-13, volatility in such \ufb02 ows remains a risk. Given the slowing growth and attendant macro- III.8 Global commodity prices, especially of oil and gold, have fallen recently. The softening of oil prices mainly re\ufb02 ects the subdued growth outlook for some advanced economies and also China. With the strengthening of US dollar, the role of gold as a safe haven asset may have weakened. Apart from that, the possibility of gold sale by some indebted euro area economies also appears to be the cause of fall in gold prices. Consequent to decline in oil and gold prices, pressures on the CAD in the short-run may have eased but there is hardly any space for complacency. \ufb01 nancial risks, as also the possibilities of global \u2018risk off\u2019 turning into global \u2018risk on\u2019 leading to reversal of capital \ufb02 ows from emerging markets, it is necessary to lower external sector risks by lowering the CAD to its sustainable level and not become complacent about external in\ufb02 ows. Overall, private sector external debt has become large and, going forward, some prudence may be necessary on external commercial borrowing (ECBs) and short-term trade credit. Capital flows continue to be strong, enabling CAD \ufb01 nancing III.10 Even though the CAD rose sharply in Q3 of 2012-13, net capital \ufb02 ows were able to \ufb01 nance it fully and there was even a marginal accretion to foreign exchange reserves (Table III.3). While portfolio \ufb02 ows broadly tracked the global optimism in Q4 of 2012-13, domestic policy measures also served as pull factors to attract FII \ufb02 ows to India. In addition to increasing FII limits in debt securities (both corporate and government) in Q3, various policy announcements in Q4, viz., (i) postponing the implementation of the General Anti- Avoidance Rule (GAAR) by two years, (ii) simpli\ufb01 cation of \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 registration rules for overseas investors and (iii) removal of separate limits for FIIs on different types of corporate bonds may have improved the market sentiment. The recent fall in global commodity prices has somewhat alleviated CAD risks and thus attracted greater FII inflows, though its financing remains a challange. III.11 While non-debt \ufb02 ows picked up in Q4, there was a mixed trend in the major components Note: Total of subcomponents may not tally with aggregate due to rounding off. P: Preliminary; PR: Partially Revised *: Includes External Assistance, ECBs, non-NRI Banking Capital and short term trade credit. of debt-creating \ufb02 ows. While NRI deposits moderated in Q4, net \ufb02 ows in the form of ECBs showed an increase (Table III.4). Moderation in NRI deposits might be partly re\ufb02 ecting the subdued income growth conditions in major source countries. During Q4, ECBs have been raised mainly to fund the power sector, modernisation, import of capital goods and new projects. In view of rising private external debt, it is important to keep in view the end-use of ECBs. Rupee remained range bound, supported by portfolio \ufb02 ows III.12 The trend of a stronger rupee observed during December 2012 to early-February 2013 was mainly supported by portfolio capital \ufb02 ows and various reform measures announced during the period. Even though the rupee witnessed some weakness during the second week of February to early March, it remained largely range-bound with some subsequent appreciation during April 2013. In Q4, the level of the real effective exchange rate (i.e., REER based on 6 and 36 currency baskets) remained almost at the level recorded in Q3 (average basis). REER witnessed some depreciation during 2012-13 (Table III.5). External debt, particularly short-term debt, rose further in Q3 III.13 India\u2019s external debt increased to US$ 376 billion as at end-December 2012, re\ufb02 ecting continued dependence on ECBs and short-term borrowings to meet the widening CAD (Table III.6). Short-term debt on a residual maturity basis has risen by about US$ 19 billion in the \ufb01 rst three quarters of 2012-13. Vulnerability indicators weakened further III.14 India\u2019s external sector vulnerability indicators deteriorated further in Q3 of 2012- 13 (Table III.7). Re\ufb02 ecting the sharper rise in external debt as compared to growth in nominal GDP (in rupee terms), the ratio of external debt to GDP increased in Q3. Similarly, the import cover declined marginally, as imports were spurred largely by oil and gold imports during the period. Re\ufb02 ecting the widening CAD, the net international investment liabilities-GDP ratio increased to 15.4 per cent at end-December 2012 from 15.1 per cent at end-September 2012. Sustained efforts needed to bring the CAD to sustainable levels, though fall in commodity prices brings temporary respite III.15 Export growth turned positive since December 2012 and this bodes well for narrowing the CAD in Q4 of 2012-13. Further, the recent fall in the prices of gold and POL, which constitute nearly 45 per cent of India\u2019s imports, may help alleviate the pressure on the trade de\ufb01 cit and, in turn, on the CAD. Even though the CAD-GDP ratio is likely to moderate from Q4 of 2012-13, it may still remain above the sustainable level in the short to medium NEER: Nominal Effective Exchange Rate.

Capital \ufb02 ows, particularly equity \ufb02 ows, remain strong, mainly re\ufb02 ecting easy global liquidity (push factor) and market participants\u2019 expectations of higher returns from the Indian markets (pull factor). The reduced pressures on the trade de\ufb01 cit coupled with higher capital \ufb02 ows are likely to facilitate smooth \ufb01 nancing of the CAD. Nonetheless, several risks remain, which require policy attention. First, even as POL and gold prices cool off, the moderation in CAD may still not be suf\ufb01 cient to bring it down to the sustainable level. Second, apart from POL and gold imports, there are also some other impediments to CAD reduction. Indian exports need to build productivity-based competitiveness and in this context, infrastructural constraints need to be addressed. It would be erroneous to take comfort from factors that are exogenous in nature, such as the fall in oil and gold prices, without addressing domestic structural problems. Third, even though FII \ufb02 ows remain strong at the moment, they may become volatile if global \ufb01 nancial conditions turn adverse. Moreover, the continuation of these \ufb02 ows depends on the growth prospects of the Indian economy and any sign of uncertainty regarding these prospects may hamper these \ufb02 ows. Fourth, the global economic outlook is far from rosy and downside risks remain substantial. Thus, sustaining Indian export recovery in such an uncertain situation would be a challenge that needs domestic efforts to raise productivity-based competitiveness. To sum up, though the recent developments have given a temporary respite to CAD risks and have eased the pressure on its \ufb01 nancing, policy efforts need to continue to bring it down to a sustainable level. The combination of growth slowdown, persistence of in\ufb02 ation above the comfort level and a historically high CAD posed a special challenge for monetary policy making during 2012-13. The Reserve Bank addressed this with calibrated reductions in the policy rate and liquidity easing measures. Despite a large injection of durable liquidity through CRR cuts and OMOs, liquidity conditions tightened especially since November 2012, mainly due to large and persistent build-ups in government cash balances. Broad money growth was in line with the Reserve Bank\u2019s indicative trajectory for 2012-13. Going forward, while the asset quality of the banking sector remains a major concern, the Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary policy would strive to ensure adequate \ufb02 ow of credit to productive sectors, while keeping a vigil on in\ufb02 ation and working towards reducing macro-economic imbalances. The Reserve Bank undertakes calibrated monetary policy easing IV.1 The Reserve Bank has been managing the growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamics based on the tenet that low and stable in\ufb02 ation secures sustained high medium-term growth and facilitates consumers\u2019 and investors\u2019 decision-making. The macroeconomic priorities that have shaped recent monetary policy making include the need to address growth slowdown, restrain in\ufb02 ation pressures and mitigate vulnerabilities in the external sector. After a quick recovery in the post-crisis period, domestic economic growth signi\ufb01 cantly decelerated in 2011-12 and further during 2012-13 on account of both sluggish global growth and domestic bottlenecks. IV.2 Taking cognizance of falling growth, the Reserve Bank lowered policy interest rate and the SLR by 100 bps each, and the CRR by 75 bps in 2012-13 on top of a 125 bps cut in the CRR in Q4 of 2011-12 (Table IV.1). It also undertook durable liquidity injections through outright purchases of G-secs as a part of open market operations (OMOs) totalling about `1.5 trillion during the year. After front-loading a 50 bps policy rate cut in April 2012, the Reserve Note: Since May 2011, the repo rate has been placed in the middle of the corridor, with the reverse repo rate 100 basis points below Bank had to hold rate in the absence of the expected momentum on \ufb01 scal consolidation and elevated in\ufb02 ation concerns. However, since September 2012, a renewed commitment to containing the \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit provided space to the Reserve Bank for further policy easing. In response, the policy rates were lowered further by 50 bps in Q4 of 2012-13. Rising CAD risks, however, prompted the Reserve Bank to exercise caution while easing. Reserve Bank took measures to combat tight liquidity conditions Liquidity conditions exhibited mixed IV.3 trends during 2012-13, with a generally comfortable liquidity situation interspersed with bouts of tightness, which, can be divided into three broad phases. In the \ufb01 rst phase, which was prolonged until June 2012, the liquidity de\ufb01 cit was broadly outside the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort zone, largely due to the spillover of the tight liquidity conditions of Q4, 2011-12. Active liquidity-easing measures taken by the Reserve Bank that included CRR cuts and open market purchases resulted in a comfortable liquidity situation by July 2012, which marked the beginning of the second phase. This phase of comfortable liquidity lasted until mid-October 2012. The third phase began thereafter, when, despite easing measures followed by the Reserve Bank, persistently high government cash balances and strong currency demand kept the inter-bank liquidity deficit beyond the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort zone. The Reserve Bank reduced the CRR in November 2012, and resumed outright OMOs on December 4, 2012 after a gap of more than five months (Chart IV.1). The third phase of liquidity deficit IV.4 continued during Q4 of 2012-13. This period saw a large build-up of government cash balance. The Reserve Bank provided liquidity through LAF injections hovering around `1 trillion on a daily average basis during this period. In order to pre-empt end-quarter liquidity pressures, the Reserve Bank lowered the CRR of scheduled banks (SCBs) by 25 basis points to 4.0 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) effective from the fortnight beginning February 9, 2013. Additionally, the Reserve Bank conducted four outright OMO (purchase) auctions during Q4 and accepted bids amounting to `335 billion in these auctions, taking the total amount of liquidity injection to `1.5 trillion through these operations during the \ufb01 nancial year, including `231 billion through anonymous trading platform (NDS-OM). Finally, in view of the anticipated large volume of banking transactions during the annual closing of accounts for 2012- 13, the Reserve Bank conducted additional liquidity operations on March 28, 2013 (only Repo) and special LAF (Repo, Reverse repo and MSF) on March 30 and 31, 2013 (i.e. Saturday and Sunday, respectively), which facilitated smooth and non-disruptive conduct of banking operations. IV.5 During 2012-13, liquidity management encountered several challenges. However, the pre-emptive and calibrated use of varied instruments, which included reduction(s) in SLR and CRR, OMO purchases and additional LAF arrangements, had a positive impact on liquidity management, which got re\ufb02 ected in many of the market indicators. The call rate generally remained anchored close to the repo rate and below the MSF rate during 2012-13. The dependence on MSF was miniscule and clearly lower than in 2011-12, despite the Reserve Bank raising the borrowing limit of SCBs under the MSF to 2 per cent of their NDTL (Chart IV.2). Moreover, the volatility of the call rate, as indicated by its monthly standard deviation, generally declined in 2012-13. The call/notice rates generally remained within the corridor except on March 28, 2013. During April 2013 so far, liquidity conditions had eased following significant draw-down of government\u2019s cash balances. Reserve money adjusted for CRR changes increased at a reasonable pace IV.6 During 2012-13, the path of reserve money mainly re\ufb02 ected developments in the net domestic asset (NDA) during the year. On the components side, growth of currency in circulation marginally decelerated, re\ufb02 ecting the impact of the economic slowdown on currency demand. Bankers\u2019 deposits with the Reserve Bank recorded negative growth, mainly on account of policy-induced CRR cuts by the Reserve Bank. Since January 2012, the CRR has been reduced in stages by 200 bps to 4 per cent, injecting around `1.3 trillion of primary liquidity into the banking system. Reserve money, adjusted for the CRR changes, however recorded a reasonable growth over the year (Chart IV.3). In Q4 of 2012-13, there was an increase IV.7 in reserve money in absolute terms. This increase in reserve money was mainly driven by an increase in the currency in circulation. On the sources side, there has been a commensurate increase in the net Reserve Bank credit to the centre. The y-o-y CRR-adjusted reserve money growth remained stable at around 9.5 per cent in 2012-13, the same as in the previous year. Broad money growth remained on the indicative trajectory IV.8 Excess reserves created through cut(s) in the CRR generally lead to increase in money supply through the money multiplier process, which crucially depends on the credit appetite of the economy. In 2012-13, there was stagnation in aggregate deposits growth and deceleration in credit growth. The latter somewhat dampened the multiplier expansion (Chart IV.4). However, the M3 remained on the indicative trajectory of the Reserve Bank during 2012-13 (Table IV.2). IV.9 On the component side, the muted aggregate deposit growth during 2012-13 at 13.5 per cent was mainly because of the deceleration in time-deposit growth. One major Note: 1. Data are provisional. reason for the deceleration was the near-zero real interest rate on term deposits mainly due to high in\ufb02 ation. Although there was monetary policy easing over 2012-13, some banks raised their deposit rates, from mid-December 2012 in certain maturity buckets in view of the tight liquidity conditions, resulting in a marginal increase in the modal deposit rate by 2 bps during the second half of 2012-13 as against a decline of 13 bps during the \ufb01 rst half of the year. During Q4 of 2012-13, although the # Based on the data collected from banks for special analysis. Dec-12 \ufb01 gures of slippage are annualised. Source: Latest updated OSMOS data. deposit growth of SCBs continued to decelerate, going forward, the ebb in in\ufb02 ation and the consequent increase in the real interest rate are likely to boost deposit growth (Chart IV.4). IV.10 Consequent to deceleration in domestic growth, the demand for credit in India was adversely affected. The deterioration in credit quality, on the other hand, impeded the supply of domestic credit. Notwithstanding the large injection of liquidity by the Reserve Bank, adverse sentiments emanating from global and domestic developments somewhat dampened credit expansion and the SCBs\u2019 non-food credit growth remained below the Reserve Bank\u2019s indicative trajectory. Despite low off-take, credit growth remained above deposit growth for most of 2012-13. However, the wedge between credit growth and deposit growth closed at the end of the year (Chart IV.1b). Preliminary data indicate that the weighted average lending rate on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by the reporting banks declined signi\ufb01 cantly during February 2013 compared with the previous month which was also re\ufb02 ected in the interest rates on fresh rupee loans sanctioned to housing and vehicle segments during that period. Risk aversion impacting credit as asset quality concerns accentuate Besides sluggish demand, a major IV.11 factor that led to the low credit growth of the banking sector over the past year is the deterioration in its asset quality. Asset quality indicators of the banking sector, which had deteriorated signi\ufb01 cantly during 2011-12, have further worsened in 2012-13 (Table IV.3). Although data indicate worsening asset quality across bank groups during Q3 of 2012-13, it continued to be led by PSBs, which account for the major portion of bank advances. Deterioration in both asset quality and macroeconomic conditions resulted in increased risk aversion and consequent deceleration in credit growth across bank groups (Table IV.4). IV.12 An analysis of the sectoral deployment of credit based on data from select banks (which cover 95 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all SCBs) for March 2013 reveals that non-food bank credit growth (y-o-y) to industries and services decelerated. The year- on-year bank credit growth to industry at 15.7 per cent in March 2013 moderated considerably, from 20.3 per cent in March 2012. Deceleration in credit growth to industry was observed in all the major sub-sectors, barring leather, chemicals, cement, wood products, food processing, textiles, glass and vehicles. Flow of resources from banks to the commercial sector was significantly augmented by non-bank sources IV.13 During 2012-13, non-banks continued to signi\ufb01 cantly contributed to the resource \ufb02 ow to the commercial sector in addition to the banks. The quantum \ufb02 ow of \ufb01 nancial resources to the commercial sector increased during 2012- 13 mainly due to an increase in non-SLR investment by SCBs and gross private placements by non-\ufb01 nancial entities compared to the corresponding period last year. Among foreign sources, while there were increases in external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and short-term credit from abroad, foreign direct investment \ufb02 ows declined (Table IV.5). B.

Monetary conditions may evolve with macroeconomic developments and shifting growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamics IV.14 While the calibrated monetary policy and liquidity measures over the year have resulted in monetary growth in line with the indicative trajectory, the monetary policy stance in 2013-14 would be conditioned primarily by three macroeconomic challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges emanate from decelerating growth, comparatively high consumer price inflation and external vulnerability. IV.15 At present, domestic in\ufb02 ation remains at a level that is above the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level. Furthermore, consumer price in\ufb02 ation is in double digits, in part driven by food in\ufb02 ation that gets a higher weight in CPI than headline in\ufb02 ation. The signi\ufb01 cant wedge between wholesale price and consumer price inflation is exacerbating the challenge for monetary management in anchoring in\ufb02 ationary expectations. IV.16 In this context, it may be restated that the Reserve Bank looks at all types of in\ufb02 ation and in\ufb02 ation indices while framing its monetary policy. While communicating its inflation projections in terms of headline WPI in\ufb02 ation, to which it accords greater weight, it does take into account CPI inflation. The high CPI in\ufb02 ation and large food in\ufb02 ation in the WPI cannot be ignored, especially in view of the consumption patterns in India and the time- tested fact that high food in\ufb02 ation, if it persists, gets generalised and often requires a monetary policy response. IV.17 Monetary policy reactions would need to keep in view the forward-looking expectations on in\ufb02 ation and the level of real interest rates. It is important to avoid \ufb01 nancial disintermediation or \ufb01 nancial repression if growth is to be revived on a sustainable footing. In a period of economic slowdown, a pro-growth monetary policy may push the interest rate down, but if the internal rate of return (IRR) falls at a faster rate due to depressed expected returns on investment, monetary policy stimulus may have limited effect. Factoring in these limitations and the three challenges enumerated above, monetary policy would need to be carefully calibrated to balance growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamics. Steady monetary easing in the face of \ufb01 scal austerity measures in advanced economies boosted global investor sentiments since Q4 of 2012. Notwithstanding the recent fallout of Cyprus, international \ufb01 nancial markets posted signi\ufb01 cant gains, especially in Japan following its recent policy stimulus and in the US on the back of improved economic data. However, improved \ufb01 nancial conditions are yet to translate into a sustained recovery in economic activity. Strong FII in\ufb02 ows, especially in H2 of 2012-13 augured well for the Indian equity market and the rupee, although the market movements were also conditioned by domestic slowdown and governance concerns. Primary equity market, however, remain subdued. Its recovery depends on improvement in macroeconomic fundamentals, continued \ufb01 scal consolidation and revival of global growth. Global \ufb01 nancial market conditions improve supported by receding tail risks strong \ufb01 scal tightening could have rami\ufb01 cations for \ufb01 nancial markets across the globe. V.1 The easing of \ufb01 nancial market tensions that began in Q3 of 2012 continued through March 2013 as policy actions contributed to reducing tail risks to the global economy, which still remain signi\ufb01 cant. Policy accommodation in the euro area through the launch of the European Central Bank (ECB) bond buying programme, the bailout of Greece and the unveiling of a road map for the euro area banking union have been instrumental in limiting the downside risks. The IMF\u2019s Global Financial Stability Report of April 2013 has noted that global \ufb01 nancial and market conditions have improved appreciably in the past six months due to monetary stimulus and liquidity support. However, further actions and balance sheet repairs are necessary to entrench \ufb01 nancial stability. V.3 Financial markets are now pricing in the impact of large \ufb01 scal and monetary stimuli provided by the new Japanese government. This includes a stimulus package of 10 trillion yen to boost growth and overcome de\ufb02 ation. The Bank of Japan set a higher in\ufb02 ation target and committed to spend 60-70 trillion yen in each of the next two years to buy bonds and other assets, while doubling its monetary base in the same period. The large dose of quantitative easing (QE) in Japan that exceeds the size of the QE by the US Fed is impacting \ufb01 nancial markets in several ways. In the currency market, yen depreciated sharply since the stimulus announcements. If it leads to sustained dollar appreciation, it can impact Indian markets through the exchange rate channel. Over time, the Japanese stimulus could impact global commodity prices upwards. V.2 In the US, the \ufb01 scal cliff has kicked in with moderate intensity. It will lead to a large predicted reduction in the budget de\ufb01 cit and consequent slowdown of the US economy. The three main components of the \ufb01 scal cliff involve partial tax increases that became operational in January 2013, \u201csequestrations\u201d or the spending reductions since March 2013 and the debt ceiling which would kick in from May 19, 2013 if no agreement is reached. Slowdown resulting from Following the above policy actions, V.4 \ufb01 nancial market volatilities have been dampened and appear to be at the lowest levels since 2007 (Chart V.1a). Further, G-sec yields of troubled euro area economies have come down sharply and, as a result, the cost of borrowing has declined, which should facilitate the fiscal adjustments. V.5 Credit default swap (CDS) spreads for troubled euro area economies declined notably since H2 of 2012 (Chart V.1b). Improved risk perceptions have translated into better market access. In January 2013, Portugal returned to the international long-term debt market for the \ufb01 rst time since 2011. The improvement in bank funding conditions allowed hundreds of euro area banks to repay higher-than-expected long term re\ufb01 nancing operation (LTRO) funding to the ECB since January 2013. V.6 Stress still remains in the euro area in some form, as was evident from the recent case of Cyprus, which became the fourth euro area member to receive a bailout after Greece, Ireland and Portugal (or the \ufb01 fth, if the partial bailout for Spanish banks is also counted). The \u20ac10 billion bailout deal with international lenders on March 25, 2013 which avoided a controversial levy on bank accounts would force large losses on big deposits in Cyprus\u2019 two largest banks. Elsewhere in Europe, a banking crisis in Slovenia looms large. Improved financial conditions slow to translate into real activity Notwithstanding the improvement in V.7 financial conditions, it remains to be seen whether it can translate into eventual real sector recovery. Current upturn in \ufb01 nancial conditions in the US has been at par or better than the financial sector improvements seen in the previous recoveries. Yet, the current real sector expansion has remained relatively weak (Chart V.2). The main reason is the deleveraging by the \ufb01 nancial and household sectors as the collapse in housing prices following the financial meltdown severely damaged their balance sheets. Notes: 1: Years indicate years of start of recession. 2: Recovery month/quarter as of\ufb01 cially announced by NBER. 3: Current recovery from 2007 recession started in June 2009 (Q2 2009). 4: FCI for 1960 is not available. Policy interventions boost global equity markets; India weighed down by weak macroeconomic performance V.8 The Japanese equity market posted the highest increase in Q4 of 2012-13 boosted by recent monetary easing. The US equity indices (both Dow Jones and S&P 500) rose to an all time high following improved economic data, such as employment, and some recovery in the housing sector. However, the European and emerging market and developing economies\u2019 (EMDEs) equity markets including that of India have underperformed. Domestic factors such as slowdown in economic growth, persistent in\ufb02 ationary pressures, and high current account de\ufb01 cit despite strong FII in\ufb02 ows added to the downward pressures on Indian markets (Chart V.3). Money markets remained orderly, despite year-end liquidity pressures around the repo rate (Chart V.4). The rates in the collateralised segments (i.e., CBLO and market repo) moved in tandem with the call rate, but generally remained below it during 2012-13. V.10 Against a backdrop of slow deposit mobilisation, the demand for certi\ufb01 cates of deposit (CDs) persisted, with the average gross fortnightly issuance of CDs remaining high and aggregating to around `332 billion in 2012-13. The average gross fortnightly issuance of commercial paper (CP) stood higher at around `318 billion. The outstanding amount of CP issued by corporates increased from `0.9 trillion at end-March 2012 to around `1.1 trillion at end-March 2013 (Table V.1). Primary yield on dated central G-sec declines, boosted by favourable market conditions V.11 The gross market borrowing of the central government through dated securities Tight liquidity conditions caused V.9 marginal increase in the average call money rate to 8.03 per cent in Q3 of 2012-13. However, following the reduction in the policy (repo) rate in the Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy Statement 2012-13 (January 29, 2013), the average call money rate declined to 7.91 per cent in Q4. The year-end scramble for funds by banks pushed the weighted average daily call rate above the formal corridor on March 28, 2013 to around 12 per cent (maximum rate was 18 per cent), and it has since reverted to hover during 2012-13 to the tune of `5.6 trillion was successfully completed, and that for 2013-14 has been budgeted slightly higher at `5.8 trillion. The weighted average maturity of the dated securities issued increased over the year, while the primary yields declined in view of the favourable market conditions and lower interest rate regime for long dated securities (Table V.2). V.12 Also, 27 states and the Union Territory of Puducherry raised `1.8 trillion on a gross basis in 2012-13. The weighted average yield \ufb01 rmed mainly on account of increase in gross market borrowing by states. Consequently, the weighted average spreads for SDL issuances over the corresponding GoI security increased. Easing trend in G-sec yield reversed at the year-end, re\ufb02 ecting limited policy space and tighter liquidity V.13 Re\ufb02 ecting expectations of a reduction in policy rate, optimism about improvement in the \ufb01 scal situation, reduction in the primary issuances, and expectations of further measures from the government to rein in the \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit, G-sec yields eased in the beginning of Q4 of 2012-13. The continuation of OMO purchase auctions also added to the positive sentiment. V.14 Nevertheless, yields hardened in Q4 of 2012-13, first in end-January after markets factored in limited space for monetary policy rate cuts and then in March due to tighter liquidity and fears that political uncertainty at the centre may impact capital in\ufb02 ows. The 10- year generic yield hardened from 7.86 per cent at end-February 2013 to 7.99 per cent at end- March 2013 (Chart V.5a). Gross amount raised (` billion) Devolvement on primary dealers (` billion) Bid-cover ratio (range) Weighted average maturity (years) Weighted average yield (%) Gross amount raised (` billion) Cut-off yield range (%) Weighted average yield (%) Weighted average spread (bps) V.15 G-sec yields have exhibited a softening bias in April 2013 on value buying, supported by lower reading of WPI in\ufb02 ation for March 2013, which aided market sentiment and strengthened the expectations of easing of policy rates. The softening of commodity prices also helped in easing of the yields. The ten year benchmark yield declined to 7.74 per cent on April 26, 2013. The traded volume in G-sec generally varied inversely with G-sec yields. Pricing in the weak macroeconomic performance, Q4 saw short-term yields persisting at levels higher than the 10-year yield (Chart V.5b). Equity market pared some gains in Q4; FII \ufb02 ows continue to be strong with the past two years. However, end-March 2013 data indicate that India is reasonably priced in terms of return on equity (ROE) and PB ratio compared to most other EMDEs (Chart V.6a) V.16 After witnessing a rally in Q3 of 2012-13, the domestic equity markets weakened during Q4, mainly on account of domestic political uncertainties at the centre in the wake of coalition politics process, slowdown in GDP growth and exports, and lower corporate earnings of some blue chip companies for Q3. During 2013-14 (up to April 26, 2013), BSE Sensex recorded gains of 2.4 per cent mainly on account of hopes of rate cut and fall in commodity prices. V.17 Key stock market indicators show that price to earnings (PE) and price to book value (PB) ratios declined in 2012-13 in comparison V.18 The Indian \ufb01 nancial market, in February 2013, had a new entrant viz., the MCX Stock Exchange Limited (MCX-SX). It officially commenced operations with the launch of its \ufb02 agship index SX40 comprising 40 blue chip companies, and is yet to gain signi\ufb01 cant market share. V.19 FIIs made net investments of `1.7 trillion in the capital market (both equity and debt) in 2012-13 compared with that of `0.9 trillion in the previous year. Their net investment in equity market was at `1.4 trillion compared with `0.4 trillion last year. Mutual funds (MFs) also made signi\ufb01 cantly higher net investments of `4.5 trillion in the capital market (both equity and debt) compared to `3.3 trillion last year (Chart V.6b). IT outperformed Sensex in Q4 of 2012-13 V.20 The BSE IT, which represents the IT sector of India, recorded q-o-q gains of 21 per cent compared with losses of 3 per cent by the BSE Sensex in Q4 of 2012-13. The in\ufb02 uential factors were strong and better-than-expected quarterly earning results of major IT companies and the announcement of measures to boost exports in the services sector in the Union Budget 2013-14. Going forward, global economic conditions would continue to primarily shape the demand for the domestic IT sector, thereby conditioning their performance. Resource mobilisation through mutual funds and QIPs gathered momentum V.21 While resource mobilisation through public issues in the debt market, ADR/GDR and IPOs remained muted, MFs posted a pick-up led by private sector MFs in 2012-13 (Table V.3). After a period of fewer mobilisations through Quali\ufb01 ed Institutional Placement (QIP) (introduced in 2006) in the recent past, `149 billion was mobilised through 43 issues in 2012- 13 (up to February). Guidelines issued by the SEBI that require listed companies to achieve and maintain public shareholding at 25 per cent by June 2013 may further encourage resource mobilisation through this route. Private placements of corporate debt increased to `3.2 trillion raised through 2,288 issues in 2012-13 (up to February). Indian rupee remained range-bound in Q4 of 2012-13 V.23 Various reform measures, inter alia, postponement of GAAR (General Anti Avoidance Rules) by two years, partial deregulation of diesel prices, liberalised FDI limits for certain sectors, rise in FII limits in corporate debt and G-sec market and announcement of fiscal consolidation path, further boosted the confidence of global investors in the Indian economy. Re\ufb02 ecting these developments, the rupee showed a modest appreciation in January 2013 which, however, Higher mobilisation achieved through disinvestment of PSEs V.22 The disinvestment programme of the Union Government generated higher mobilisation of about `240 billion during 2012- 13. Various public sector enterprises, viz., NBCC, HCL, NMDC, OIL, NTPC, RCF, NALCO and SAIL, divested their stake, with NTPC mobilising the maximum amount of around `115 billion. The disinvestment programme for 2013-14 is budgeted higher at `400 billion. came under pressure thereafter partly due to dollar demand from oil importing companies (Chart V.7). Overall, the rupee remained stable against the dollar in Q4 of 2012-13 over Q3. The rupee has been gaining strength since the second week of April 2013 as concerns regarding the CAD seem to have somewhat diminished on account of fall in international prices of crude oil and gold and positive trend in export. V.24 As at end-March 2013, the rupee showed lower depreciation (y-o-y) compared to some other major EMDEs, such as Brazil, South Africa and Argentina. However sustained efforts to control the widening current account are required to bolster global con\ufb01 dence in the Indian economy and attract stable capital flows to enable smooth CAD financing. In the interim, corporates need to factor in the risks of unexpected currency volatilities and appropriately hedge a larger proportion of their currency exposures. Near-term risks from euro area reduced, domestic reform initiatives to boost investor sentiment in 2013-14 V.26 Despite weak global growth, the start of sequestration in the US and concerns about Italy and Cyprus, the global \ufb01 nancial condition improved during Q4, mainly on account of central banks\u2019 QE measures. Steady commitment to accommodative monetary policy in the face of \ufb01 scal austerity in advanced economies (AEs) is likely to support investor sentiments in the short-run. However, the persistence of exceptionally low interest rates over the medium-run poses risks of re-emergence of \ufb01 nancial sector imbalances and vulnerabilities. It is, therefore, important for the AEs to clean up their bank balance sheets at the earliest and for EMDEs such as India to build liquidity buffers to meet any shocks from contagion from the AEs should the tail risks materialise. House prices continue to rise with increasing volumes V.25 The annual growth in the Reserve Bank\u2019s quarterly House Price Index at all-India level has hovered around 20 per cent for the past eight quarters, with all cities, except Kanpur, registering positive growth in Q3 of 2012-13. Transaction volumes also picked up, registering V.27 On the domestic front, the slow recovery envisaged in 2013-14 may support the \ufb01 nancial markets. However, macro-\ufb01 nancial risks are rising as is evident from sub-par corporate earnings, deteriorating asset quality and stretched leverage in certain sectors, especially power and construction. However, sustained commitment to reforms and policy action could considerably lower this risk. Growth slowdown, softer commodity prices, range-bound exchange rate in recent months and past monetary policy actions contributed to the moderation of headline in\ufb02 ation to 6.0 per cent (provisional) in March 2013 from 7.7 per cent in March 2012. In\ufb02 ation, however, continues to remain above comfort level. The divergence between WPI and CPI in\ufb02 ation widened, re\ufb02 ecting high food in\ufb02 ation, which is a source of concern. Headline in\ufb02 ation in 2013-14 is expected to remain range-bound around the current level. While sluggish global growth may dampen global in\ufb02 ation risks, domestically energy price adjustments, supply-side bottlenecks, including that of food, and sustained wage pressures may offset the moderation of in\ufb02 ation resulting from growth moderation and past monetary policy actions. Global in\ufb02 ationary pressures remained muted in 2012-13 VI.1 Global in\ufb02 ation continued to remain muted against the backdrop of fragile and uneven global economic recovery. In advanced economies (AEs), weak demand pressure and high unemployment rate contributed to low in\ufb02 ation. The April 2013 World Economic Outlook (WEO) projected the consumer price in\ufb02 ation in the AEs to moderate to 1.7 per cent in 2013 from 2.0 per cent in 2012. In emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), it is projected to remain at 5.9 per cent in 2013, same as in the previous year. VI.2 Low in\ufb02 ation, even below the in\ufb02 ation targets in the case of several AEs, provided space to extend their monetary accommodation through unconventional monetary policies. Policy rates in several AEs remained at the zero lower bound, prompting them to undertake further doses of quantitative easing (QE) (Table VI.1). Some other AEs that had space lowered policy rates further. The central banks of AEs continue to stimulate protracted recovery along with well-anchored in\ufb02 ation expectations. While the immediate risk of global in\ufb02 ation resurgence remains low, once recovery shapes up, in\ufb02 ation concerns could resurface given the presence of excess global liquidity. Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa and some East European countries, faced high in\ufb02 ation in 2012. India emerged as an outlier among BRICS and the G-20 nations with double-digit CPI in\ufb02 ation (Table VI.1). India\u2019s high CPI in\ufb02 ation remains a worry in the context of its increased openness and on account of welfare implications. Global commodity prices exhibit softening bias VI.4 The year 2012-13 was marked by stable oil and food prices and softer prices for metals, beverages and agricultural raw materials. Metal prices, after falling until in August 2012, witnessed an uptrend subsequent months (Chart VI.1). However, global oil and non-oil commodity prices witnessed marked correction during April 2013, re\ufb02 ecting improved supply prospects VI.3 Although consumer price in\ufb02 ation generally remained moderate in the case of EMDEs, some EMDEs, including India, the and weaker global growth expectations. Global food prices continued to remain range-bound. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) assessment indicate improved food supply outlook for 2013 on account of favourable production prospects. was facilitated by a decline in manufactured non-food products in\ufb02 ation, which came down sharply to 3.5 per cent (provisional) in March Domestic headline in\ufb02 ation moderated as generalised in\ufb02 ationary pressures eased the range of VI.5 After remaining 7.5\u20138.1 per cent during H1 of 2012-13, wholesale price index (WPI) in\ufb02 ation (y-o-y) in India moderated gradually to 5.96 per cent, (provisional) in March 2013 (Chart VI.2). Moderation in headline in\ufb02 ation has been signi\ufb01 cant even as price pressures continued to persist from the food and fuel segments. This 2013, reaching its lowest level in the past three years. While subdued pressures from global commodity prices and the range-bound exchange rate helped the course of downward movement in the in\ufb02 ation trajectory, the decline in in\ufb02 ation also re\ufb02 ects the impact of growth moderation and the weak pricing power of \ufb01 rms as well as past monetary policy actions aimed at containing in\ufb02 ation and anchoring in\ufb02 ation expectations. The momentum of price changes, as indicated by 3-month moving average seasonally adjusted month-over-month changes, also moderated in H2 of 2012-13. VI.6 Moderation in in\ufb02 ation has not been commensurate with the slowdown in growth, in part because structural factors are keeping prices up, and in part because price softening was offset by revisions in administered prices, especially in the fuel group (Chart VI.3). To the extent that administered price increases keep headline in\ufb02 ation above market-determined prices, it re\ufb02 ects the lagged pass-through. the current year (Chart VI.4). The delayed and skewed south-west monsoon had a signi\ufb01 cant impact on the production of cereals and pulses, which triggered the initial price spurt. However, despite the presence of large buffer stocks, price increases continued to be persistent. It is observed that there has been a secular build-up in the stock of foodgrains in recent years that are much above the buffer norms (see Chapter I). Cereals and pulses emerge as major pressure points for food in\ufb02 ation VI.7 Food prices continued to increase during the Q4 of 2012-13. The contribution of different items to overall food in\ufb02 ation, however, changed during the year. After exhibiting moderate price increases in the previous year, the price increases in cereals and pulses became quite signi\ufb01 cant during VI.8 The minimum support prices (MSP) of most cereals and pulses have increased signi\ufb01 cantly in recent years, which has emerged as an additional source of pressure. This is particularly true in the case of paddy (Table VI.2). However, total rice production fell during 2012-13, due mainly to drought conditions in parts of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and other rice-producing states. burden arising from administered prices, the price of diesel was raised by `5 per litre in September 2012. Also the number of subsidised LPG cylinders per consumer was capped at six (which was later raised to nine). In January 2013, the government allowed OMCs to raise the retail price of diesel in a staggered manner and to charge bulk consumers the market price of diesel. VI.9 Apart from cereals, volatility in prices of vegetables and fruits added to domestic price pressures. Also, in\ufb02 ation in protein-rich food items continued to remain elevated since, apart from pulses, price increases have been signi\ufb01 cant for eggs, \ufb01 sh and meat. In\ufb02 ation in milk, however, moderated over the course of the year. Manufactured food products in\ufb02 ation also tracked the trends in primary food in\ufb02 ation. VI.10 Persistent increases in domestic food prices during 2012-13, despite range-bound global food prices, calls for a relook at the overall agriculture price policy, where MSPs and large buffer stocks are the two major policy tools. While food security is of paramount importance in a country such as India, recent experience suggests that large buffer stocks have not been effective in dampening prices, even as the system is bearing large carrying costs and storage losses. Also, signi\ufb01 cant increases in the cost of production in agriculture, driven largely by the increase in wage costs, added to pressure on food prices. As has been highlighted in the past, the changing pattern of consumption in favour of protein-rich items has not been matched by supply elasticities, which added pressure from the demand side. Addressing these issues by augmenting supply capacities could be critical in achieving the goal of stable food prices. VI.12 Although the revisions in administered fuel prices led to some decline in the extent of suppressed in\ufb02 ation, the gap still persists (Chart VI.5). This has resulted in a substantial build-up in the under-recoveries of the oil marketing companies (OMCs) to the tune of `1.61 trillion during 2012-13, of which 57 per cent was on account of diesel. The decision to allow small, step-wise increases in diesel prices could result in some persistence of fuel in\ufb02 ation during 2013-14. However, a gradual and calibrated increase in price to align it with international prices is desirable, since large discrete price changes often have a distortionary impact on in\ufb02 ation expectations. VI.13 Although there was some moderation in international coal price, the gap between domestic and global prices persists. Of the total estimated domestic demand of about 770 MT during 2013-14, 21 per cent would have to be met through imports. Greater reliance on imports for bridging domestic demand-supply gap could lead to increase in costs which could re\ufb02 ect in prices. Administered price revisions keep fuel in\ufb02 ation high and persistent VI.11 Revision in administered prices largely shaped the course of fuel in\ufb02 ation during the year. Given the unsustainable level of subsidy VI.14 The recent debt restructuring of most State Electricity Boards (SEBs) would lead to improved \ufb01 nancial positions and, thereby, improve their sustainability. However, the debt restructuring is also conditional on signi\ufb01 cant increases in prices to make them \ufb01 nancially viable. This is partly re\ufb02 ected in increases in electricity prices in June 2012, which exerted upward pressure on fuel in\ufb02 ation. Further increases can be expected in the near term. However, if the improved \ufb01 nancial condition of the SEBs leads to better delivery, the reliance on more expensive sources of power such as gensets could decline, which could lead to a decline in the overall power cost for \ufb01 rms. Generalised in\ufb02 ationary pressures ease as output gap remains negative VI.15 The major development in in\ufb02 ation dynamics in recent months was the marked decline in non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation. The month-over-month seasonally (3-month adjusted moving average), which is an indicator of the momentum of price increases, also indicates signi\ufb01 cant moderation in price pressures in recent months (Chart VI.6). annualised VI.16 The decline in the contribution of the metals and chemicals group has been the major driver of the moderation in in\ufb02 ation within the non-food manufactured products group (Chart VI.7). As prices moderated in the international commodity markets and the rupee remained range-bound, the bene\ufb01 ts got passed on to domestic in\ufb02 ation. This reaf\ufb01 rms the fact that in the absence of offsetting pressures, generalised in\ufb02 ation does moderate with a negative output gap. Pattern of price changes points signi\ufb01 cant moderation VI.17 A look at the distribution of price changes within non-food manufactured products that during 2012-13, the share of items exhibiting month-over- in prices has gradually month declined, while the share of items reporting price decreases has increased (Chart VI.8). This points to the presence of a strong further disin\ufb02 ationary momentum, which corroborates the weak pricing power. The PMI input and output price indices in recent months exhibited moderation, further pointing towards moderation of in\ufb02 ation pressures. VI.18 During the three-year period of high in\ufb02 ation (2010-11 to 2012-13), the month- to-month volatility of all-commodities WPI in\ufb02 ation declined, re\ufb02 ecting its persistence. During 2012-13, the declining volatility re\ufb02 ects gradual moderation in overall in\ufb02 ation. The relative price variability across commodities, which was high in 2011-12, also declined during 2012-13, suggesting that softening of in\ufb02 ation has occurred in a generalised manner Chart VI.9 (a & b). VI.20 In the private corporate sector, the increase in staff costs remained signi\ufb01 cant, indicating persistent pressure from wage costs (see Chapter II). The results of the Annual Survey of Industries (available up to 2010-11) also show double-digit growth in wages in the factory sector, pointing towards pressure on industry from high wages. Divergence between WPI and CPI in\ufb02 ation widened Wage growth pressures persist, although with some moderation VI.19 Persistent pressure from wages remains a major risk to in\ufb02 ation moderation. Although the pace of increase of rural wages moderated, it continues to be in double digits. However, the sharp increase in in\ufb02 ation in rural areas in recent months led to signi\ufb01 cant moderation in real wage growth (Chart VI.10). State-speci\ufb01 c factors continue to play a major role in wage-price dynamics, with signi\ufb01 cant variation in in\ufb02 ation and wage growth being observed across the major states (Chart VI.11). Consumer price some commodities diverges between rural and urban areas the gap between the two (10.4 per cent and 6.0 per cent in new CPI and WPI, respectively, in March 2013) (Chart VI.12). This divergence is on account of several factors. Both the higher weight of food in the new CPI (47.6 per cent) compared with the WPI (24.3 per cent), and higher food in\ufb02 ation in new CPI at 12.4 per cent compared with 8.1 per cent in WPI for March 2013 contributed to the divergence. In particular, new CPI in\ufb02 ation for vegetables, oils & fat, milk, sugar and eggs, \ufb01 sh & meat was higher than that in the WPI possibly re\ufb02 ecting trade and transport margins and other supply chain inef\ufb01 ciencies. Also, housing, which is only part of the new CPI, exhibited double- digit in\ufb02 ation. VI.22 There were in in\ufb02 ation by commodity groups in rural and urban areas (Chart VI.13). The fuel & light group witnessed higher in\ufb02 ation in urban areas. In\ufb02 ation in clothing, bedding and footwear was higher in rural areas in recent months. While overall food in\ufb02 ation remained more or less the same between rural and urban areas. However, within food groups there was signi\ufb01 cant divergence in in\ufb02 ation trends. In\ufb02 ation was higher in cereals, pulses, \u2018eggs, \ufb01 sh and meat\u2019 and prepared meals in urban areas, while \u2018milk & milk products\u2019, \u2018condiments & spices\u2019, sugar and edible oils recorded higher in\ufb02 ation in rural areas. These divergence in in\ufb02 ation may also in part re\ufb02 ect supply chain inef\ufb01 ciencies across various regions but it needs a thorough examination. Regional variation in in\ufb02 ation remains signi\ufb01 cant VI.23 Though starting at around the similar rate of 10 per cent in May 2012, CPI in\ufb02 ation across various regions of the country exhibited signi\ufb01 cant divergence in recent months. Notably, the north-eastern region witnessed lower in\ufb02 ation than the rest of the country (Chart VI.14). In\ufb02 ation differential across regions could be due to region-speci\ufb01 c factors, such as the composition of the consumption basket and transport costs. State-speci\ufb01 c government policies, such as the availability of fair price shops and restrictions on inter- state movement of goods could also lead to the differences in in\ufb02 ation. VI.24 Recent trends in the prices of selected food articles collected across various regions by the Reserve Bank indicate further \ufb01 rming up of the prices of cereals, both in the wholesale and retail markets, while prices of pulses showed some moderation. The average mark- up in the prices between retail and wholesale markets during Q4 of 2012-13 were sustained in the range of 7\u201320 per cent for cereals and pulses, and it varied in the range of 22\u201345 per cent for perishable items, including vegetables, fruits and \ufb01 sh. Headline in\ufb02 ation is expected to remain range-bound during 2013-14 VI.25 Going forward, the growth slowdown and the lagged impact of past monetary policy actions are expected to keep in\ufb02 ation moderate from the demand side. The recent fall in global commodity prices and subdued demand conditions may result in some further moderation in headline in\ufb02 ation in the coming months, but overall in\ufb02 ation is likely to stay range-bound. From the supply side, price adjustments in diesel, coal and electricity, in\ufb02 ation when effected, may offset moderation due to slack demand. Moreover, food in\ufb02 ation remains a major pressure point accentuated by continuing supply bottlenecks. A sustained moderation in food in\ufb02 ation would entail greater emphasis on removing supply bottlenecks and raising agricultural productivity. The near-term path of food in\ufb02 ation, however, is also contingent upon the performance of the monsoon. The global environment remains uncertain, and despite the recent moderation, possible upswings in fuel prices or depreciation of the exchange rate pose further upside risks. Risks also stem from the possible wage-price spiral and high in\ufb02 ation expectations. In view of these factors, the monetary policy has to continue its close vigil on the in\ufb02 ation front while continuing to facilitate growth recovery. The slowdown in the Indian economy persisted, with growth hobbled by structural bottlenecks and adverse global conditions. While demand-side in\ufb02 ation pressures reduced, high consumer price in\ufb02 ation along with the current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD) well above sustainable levels limits the space for monetary policy to support growth. Surveys show that business con\ufb01 dence remains subdued despite reforms and policy initiatives since September 2012. Against this backdrop, a recovery in 2013-14 is likely to be slow-paced. It would require further all-round efforts that includes initiatives to remove structural impediments and improve governance. Resolving outstanding issues that constrain infrastructure investment and a public investment stimulus rebalanced by revenue spending cuts holds the key to the economy\u2019s revival. Growth slowdown, macroeconomic risks come to fore in 2012-13 VII.1 Growth slowdown, persistent in\ufb02 ation and the twin de\ufb01 cit risks came to the fore during 2012-13 and enervated the Indian economy endangering the reversal of its declining growth path. Amidst trade-offs, monetary policy factored in increased growth risks and shifted its stance to calibrated easing to address the growth slow down as headline inflation gradually moderated. The government also launched concerted policy action and reforms during H2 of 2012-13. These reforms, with fuller implementation, are expected to arrest the downward spiral and kick in a modest recovery in 2013-14. VII.2 In the interim, growth impulses turned weaker in H2 of 2012-13 as mining and manufacturing activity remained subdued and slowdown spilled over to certain segments of the services sector, most notably \u2018trade, hotels, transport and communication\u2019. Growth in Q3 of 2012-13 dropped to a 15-quarter low of 4.5 per cent, taking the growth during the \ufb01 rst three quarters to 5.0 per cent . It looks probable that growth for 2012-13 may be at a 10-year low at about the CSO\u2019s Advance Estimates of 5.0 per cent. VII.3 Part of the slowdown has been due to global factors with weak external demand impacting activity levels, especially that of the manufacturing sector. Growth in most emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) slowed during 2012 and their growth is expected to stay low in 2013. On the domestic front, the services sector activity decelerated. The sector has been the mainstay of India\u2019s recent growth story. Industrial growth is now virtually facing stagnation resulting from a combination of factors, most notably the investment cycle downturn, supply-side bottlenecks, governance problems and weak external demand. Slowing private consumption demand is also dragging down growth, especially in the recent quarters. VII.4 Macro-\ufb01 nancial conditions worsened with slowing growth, widening current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD) and persistence of high consumer price in\ufb02 ation. The CAD/GDP ratio rose to a record 6.7 per cent in Q3 of 2012-13. Notwithstanding likely improvement in Q4, the CAD/GDP ratio is expected to be at a new high of around 5.0 per cent for the year 2012-13, which is about twice the sustainable level. Other indicators also suggest increased external sector vulnerabilities. Short-term debt on a residual maturity basis increased to 44.1 per cent of the total debt and 56.2 per cent of the foreign exchange reserves by end-December 2012. The economy has become vulnerable to any event shocks that might precipitate a sudden stop or a reversal of capital in\ufb02 ows. The recent fall in global commodity prices, especially of crude oil and gold, provide some much needed relief, but being complacent based on price movements that may not necessarily be enduring could be myopic since the CAD/GDP ratio could exceed sustainable levels for the third successive year in 2013-14. Macro-financial risks start getting addressed, may pave the way for recovery VII.5 The widening CAD was accompanied by an increasing \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit in H1 of 2012-13. With the emerging macroeconomic imbalance from the \ufb01 scal side that had accentuated the twin de\ufb01 cit risks, the government embraced a plan for fiscal consolidation following the recommendations of the Kelkar Committee. The Committee had projected the GFD/GDP ratio to touch 6.1 per cent for 2012-13 in the absence of corrective measures. However, binding itself to a credible commitment to lower \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cits, the GFD/GDP ratio was lowered to 5.2 per cent in 2012-13. This correction has effectively lowered the twin deficit risks at a critical juncture. If the government stays on its \ufb01 scal plans in 2013-14 and rebalances spending from non-plan to planned expenditure, it would lay the foundation for a sustainable recovery. VII.7 Recovery at the current juncture will critically depend on supply-side action to remove a host of micro-constraints and structural bottlenecks that impede production and investment, especially in growth-driving sectors such as road and power. The government has initiated action in this direction, but progress has been slow, making it imperative for decisive action to be taken quickly on the outstanding issues. Failure to do so could lead to multiple problems and cause further deterioration in the asset quality of bank \ufb01 nance, choke off \ufb02 ow of debt as well as equity \ufb01 nance to stressed \ufb01 rms and stall recovery in its tracks. In addition, a signi\ufb01 cant dose of public investment stimulus could crowd-in private investment, but such a stimulus needs to be financed within the budgetary constraints by downsizing its current spending. Business expectations surveys show little improvement in sentiments VII.6 Monetary space in 2012-13 was constrained by twin deficits and elevated in\ufb02 ation. Headline in\ufb02 ation hovered in the 7-8 per cent band for most of the year before moderating to about 6.0 per cent by the end of 2012-13. However, a more perceptible fall in non-food manufactured product in\ufb02 ation along with marked progress in addressing \ufb01 scal risks provided headroom for monetary policy to start easing. Using the available space, it lowered policy rates cumulatively by 100 bps, CRR by VII.8 The current growth slowdown has been ampli\ufb01 ed by the loss of business con\ufb01 dence. Con\ufb01 dence has been dented by macroeconomic deterioration, global macroeconomic and \ufb01 nancial uncertainties and the perception of adverse and biased information, driven in part by recent experience during the global \ufb01 nancial crisis. In this environment, expectations are being anchored around recent bad news. VII.9 Various surveys on business expectations indicate that business con\ufb01 dence remains subdued despite policy action and reforms during H2 of 2012-13 (Table VII.1). Although the seasonally adjusted HSBC Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Indices (PMI) for manufacturing and services (March 2013) remained in expansion mode, they recorded the slowest pace of expansion in the last 16 and 17 months, respectively. Industrial Outlook Survey re\ufb02 ects further weakening of business expectations in Q1 of 2013-14. VII.10 The Reserve Bank\u2019s 61st Round of the Industrial Outlook Survey (http://www.rbi.org. in/IOS61) conducted during Q4 of 2012-13 showed that the Business Expectation Index (BEI), a composite indicator based on several business parameters recorded marginal improvement for Q4 of 2012-13. However, index capturing expectations for Q1 of 2013-14 dropped significantly (Chart VII.1). These indices have persisted in the growth terrain (i.e. above 100, which is the threshold that separates contraction from expansion). VII.11 An analysis of the net responses among various components of demand conditions showed improved optimism on order books, capacity utilisation and exports during Q4 of 2012-13. However, their outlook for Q1 of 2013-14 showed signi\ufb01 cant moderation. The sentiments on the overall \ufb01 nancial situation re\ufb02 ected lower optimism (Table VII.2). E-Expectations and A- Assessment. 1 Net response is the percentage difference between optimistic (positive) and pessimistic (negative) responses; responses indicating status quo (no change) are not reckoned. Higher \u2018net response\u2019 indicates higher level of optimism and vice versa. * These questions are new and have been added in the 61st Round (January-March 2013) by splitting the question on Availability of \ufb01 nance (both internal and external sources). VII.12 The Reserve Bank\u2019s 12th Round of the Consumer Con\ufb01 dence Survey (http://www.rbi. org.in/CCS12), conducted in March 2013 indicates a declining trend in consumer con\ufb01 dence for the past one year (Chart VII.2). Table VII.3: Agencies\u2019 projections for 2013-14 External agencies expect revival in the economy VII.13 Forecasts by various external agencies indicate a moderate recovery in the Indian economy during 2013-14. The projections for GDP growth range from 5.8 per cent to 6.7 per cent (Table VII.3). Current projections by these agencies are slightly lower than their earlier projections, indicating that they anticipate a weaker recovery. Survey of Professional Forecasters anticipates modest recovery in growth1 VII.14 The Reserve Bank\u2019s 23rd Round of the Survey of Professional Forecasters outside the Reserve Bank (http://www.rbi.org.in/SPF23) shows anticipation of modest recovery in 2013- 14 to 6.0 per cent from 5.0 per cent in the preceding year. Average WPI inflation is expected to moderate to 6.5 per cent from 7.3 per cent. 5-year ahead in\ufb02 ation expectations moderated slightly (Chart VII.3a) Both these latest growth and in\ufb02 ation projections are half a percentage downward revision from the earlier round. Forecasters expect the CAD to come down to 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2013-14 from a projected 5.1 per cent for 2012-13 (Table VII.4). Modest decline observed in the households\u2019 in\ufb02 ation expectations VII.15 The latest round of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households (IESH Round 31) (http://www.rbi.org.in/IESH31) indicates that the perception of current in\ufb02 ation as well as the mean and median expectations on future in\ufb02 ation, both at 3-month and 1-year ahead, has decreased in this quarter (i.e., January-March 2013) as compared with the previous quarter (Chart VII.3b). Moreover, the percentage of respondents expecting price rise \u2018more than the current rate\u2019 in next quarter as well as next year has decreased as compared with the last round of the survey. Slow-paced recovery likely in 2013-14 but negative output gap may persist VII.16 Given the current state of the economy, the policy action taken so far and the expectations 1 The forecasts re\ufb02 ect the views of professional forecasters and not of the Reserve Bank.

Note: The latest round refers to 23rd Round for the quarter ended March 2013, while previous round refers to 22nd Round for the quarter ended December 2012. of various economic agents and factoring in a reasonable policy response ahead, the Reserve Bank\u2019s baseline assessment is that a recovery in 2013-14 is likely but would be contingent on further policy action to unwind the bottlenecks to productive activity. The output gap would still remain negative during 2013-14. VII.17 India\u2019s sub-par economic activity over the past two years is not completely surprising given that growth has slowed down in most EMDEs. With the exception of China, India and Indonesia, growth in most EMDEs slipped to below 4 per cent in 2012. Deceleration in world trade played a major role in slowing down the growth of EMDEs. According to the IMF\u2019s WEO, the volume of world trade in goods and services expanded 2.5 per cent in 2012, which is a considerably slower pace than the average annual growth of 6.3 per cent during 1995-2011. If global trade in goods and services picks up on improved external demand, it would have a positive effect on domestic manufacturing activity that has high export intensity. Invisibles earnings could also improve with an acceleration in software exports. This would help in narrowing the CAD and reducing external sector risks to macroeconomic stability. However, the baseline projections in the WEO of April 2013 suggest that the volume of global trade in goods and services is likely expand at a slow pace of 3.6 per cent in 2013. VII.18 Dependence on improved external demand to shape recovery in India could, therefore, be problematic. External uncertainties remain signi\ufb01 cant from euro area problems in Italy, Cyprus and Slovenia, the sequestration impact in the US and unconventional policies in Japan. How they ultimately shape global capital \ufb02 ows would have an impact on the rupee. VII.19 As such, recovery crucially hinges on domestic action. Interest rates can play only a limited role in revival. Activity in the mining sector has been severely affected by legal enforcements on illegal mining, cancellation of inappropriate coal block auctions and law and order problems. Vexed issues have also cropped up on natural gas pricing and coal supply, which threaten the viability of the new power project investments. The telecom sector, which was a major driver of the investment boom in the past, is facing issues of regulation, besides penetration ratios plateauing out. Execution of road projects slowed down in 2012-13 despite record tendering in 2011-12, mainly on account of failures to meet environmental requirements and land acquisition issues, as also the rising leverage of the project executing \ufb01 rms (see Chapter 2 for more details). While appropriate regulatory and legal frameworks are necessary to ensure sustainable growth, transparency and the speedy redressal of issues would go a long way towards improving the business climate. VII.20 Corporate investment has slowed down due to structural and cyclical factors after a capital expenditure boom during 2003-11, in which planned fixed investments of the corporates in large projects increased over 8.6 times in eight years. However, if structural issues of the kind mentioned above are quickly resolved, a turnaround in investment activity should be possible. VII.21 The forecast by Indian Meteorological Department of a normal monsoon estimated at 98 + 5 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA) raises hope that consumption may improve. Some further moderation in headline in\ufb02 ation in H1 of 2013-14 from the current levels can also be expected to have a favourable impact on real private consumption. Therefore, the growth recovery process in the economy should kick-in later during 2013-14 but the pace of recovery is likely to remain slow. In\ufb02 ation likely to stay above comfort levels in 2013-14 and remain range-bound around current levels VII.22 Average headline inflation declined from 9.6 per cent in 2010-11 to 8.9 per cent in 2011-12 and further to 7.3 per cent in 2012-13, with a low of 6.0 per cent in March 2013. As a baseline case, it is expected to see some further moderation in H1 of 2013-14 on the back of subdued pricing power of domestic producers and falling global commodity prices before it increases somewhat in H2 due to base effects and a reduction in the output gap. On the whole, in\ufb02 ation during 2013-14 is likely to remain range-bound around current levels, but stay above the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort level. Signi\ufb01 cant suppressed in\ufb02 ation lingers in the system, despite the considerable pass-through that occurred during 2012-13. The proposed diesel price pass-through and the likely increase in electricity tariffs and coal prices, would exert some upward pressure on prices. VII.23 An increase in coal prices would be necessitated, factoring in coal imports that would be needed to bridge the demand-supply gap. An increase in power tariffs is expected along the lines envisaged as part of the restructuring package for the distribution companies. Sticking to the envisaged path of diesel price hikes is necessary to create \ufb01 scal space for increasing public investments and for lowering the fiscal risks to macro-financial stability. VII.24 As a baseline case, the outlook on global energy prices is benign. Supplies are expected to improve, in part by the exploitation of shale gas reserves in the US. Along with soft metal prices, it could contribute signi\ufb01 cantly to keeping the imported in\ufb02 ation component low during 2013-14, though its ultimate transmission would depend on the extent of correction in the CAD and the consequent rupee exchange rate movements. Macro-\ufb01 nancial risks require cautious monetary policy response ahead VII.25 Even while macro-\ufb01 nancial stability risks have started getting addressed, they stay significant at the current juncture. This necessitates careful calibration of monetary policy during 2013-14. While several risk factors impinge upon the likely growth and in\ufb02 ation outcomes for 2013-14, six factors may be highlighted in this context. First, if consumption decelerates markedly from here and impacts staples and not just discretionary items, it could delay the recovery process. However, given that CAD risks are still large, monetary stimulus from a consumption viewpoint needs to be restrained for some time to allow the trade account to adjust. Second, the risk of a sub-normal monsoon to growth and in\ufb02 ation cannot be ignored altogether for 2013- 14 despite forecast of a normal monsoon. Third, the biggest risk to recovery comes from failure to effectively complete policy action to remove supply-side constraints that impede investments. This could bring to the fore both the growth and \ufb01 nancial stability risks. With rising corporate leverage, especially in the infrastructure space, it is necessary to resolve the vexed structural issues that the sector faces. Fourth, while \ufb01 scal risks have been lowered, they have not waned. If growth slows down further it could result in revenue shortfalls that could lead to the resurgence of \ufb01 scal risks.

Early results of corporate performance in Q4 indicate continuing moderation in sales\tthough\tprofit\tmargins\tincreased\t slightly.

In consonance with the cuts in the 20. policy repo rate and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) during 2012-13, the modal term deposit rate declined by 11 basis points (bps) and the modal base rate by 50 bps. While the decline in the term deposit rate occurred\tmostly\tduring\tthe\tfirst\thalf,\tthe\t modal base rate softened by 50 bps to 10.25 per cent in two steps of 25 bps each during Q1 and Q4 of 2012-13. During Q4, 39 banks reduced their base rates in the range of 5-75 bps. The weighted average lending rate of banks declined by 36 bps to 12.17 per cent during 2012- 13 (up to February). Liquidity remained under pressure 21. throughout the year because of persistently high government cash balances with the Reserve Bank and elevated incremental credit to deposit ratio for much of the year.

In order to alleviate liquidity pressures, the Reserve Bank lowered the CRR of SCBs cumulatively by 75 bps on three occasions and the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) by 100 bps during the year. Additionally, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity to the tune of `1,546 billion through open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions. The net injection of liquidity under the LAF, which peaked at `1,808 billion\ton\tMarch\t28,\t2013\treflecting\tthe\t year-end demand, reversed sharply to `842 billion by end-April 2013.

Conditional upon a normal monsoon, agricultural growth could return to trend levels. The outlook for industrial activity remains subdued, with the pipeline of new investment drying up and existing projects stalled by bottlenecks and implementation gaps. With global growth unlikely to improve significantly from 2012, growth in services and exports may remain sluggish. Accordingly, the baseline GDP growth for 2013-14 is projected at 5.7 per cent (Chart 1). timing and magnitude of administered price revisions, particularly of electricity and coal, will impact the evolution of the trajectory\tof\tinflation\tin\t2013-14.

Consistent with the above growth 31. projections and the Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation\ttolerance\tthreshold,\tM3 growth for 2013-14 is projected at 13.0 per cent for policy purposes. Consequently, aggregate deposits of SCBs are projected to grow by 14.0 per cent. Keeping in view the resource requirements of the private sector, the growth in non-food credit of SCBs is projected at 15.0 per cent. As always, these numbers are indicative projections and not targets. The conduct of monetary policy would be guided by the evolution of monetary aggregates along these indicative trajectories. ii) Even as the large CAD is a risk by itself, its financing exposes the economy to the risk of sudden stop and reversal of capital flows. Although the CAD could be financed\tlast\tyear\tbecause\tof\teasy\t liquidity conditions in the global system, the global liquidity situation could quickly alter for EDEs, including India, for two reasons. First, the outlook for AEs remains uncertain, and even if there may be no event shocks, there could well be process shocks which could result in capital outflows from EDEs. Second, with quantitative easing (QE), AE central banks are in uncharted territory with considerable uncertainty about the trajectory of recovery and the calibration of QE. Should global liquidity conditions rapidly tighten, India could potentially face a problem of sudden stop and reversal of\tcapital\tflows\tjeopardising\tour\t macro-financial\tstability. iii) Sustained revival of growth is not possible without a revival of investment. But investment sentiment remains inhibited owing to\tsubdued\tbusiness\tconfidence\tand\t dented\tbusiness\tprofitability.\tBoth\t borrowers and lenders have become risk averse. Borrowers have become risk averse because of governance concerns, delays in approvals and tighter credit conditions. For lenders, risk aversion stems from the erosion of asset quality, deteriorating\tcash\tflow\tsituation\tof\t borrowers eroding their credit worthiness and heightened risk premiums. iv) Looking ahead, the effectiveness of monetary policy in bringing down inflation\tpressures\tand\tanchoring\t inflation expectations could be undermined by supply constraints in the economy, particularly in the food and infrastructure sectors. Food price pressures, upward revisions in the MSPs and rapid wage increases are leading to a wage-price spiral. Without policy efforts to unlock the tightening supply constraints and bring enduring improvements in productivity and competitiveness, growth could weaken even further and inflationary strains could re-emerge. The Reserve Bank began exiting 33. from the crisis driven expansionary policy in October 2009. Between January 2010 and October 2011, the Reserve Bank cumulatively raised the CRR by 100 bps and the policy repo rate 13 times by a total of 375 bps, with the monetary policy stance biased towards containing inflation and anchoring inflation expectations. In view of slowdown in growth, 34. especially investment activity, and some moderation in inflation, the Reserve Bank paused in December 2011. It indicated that no further tightening might be required and that future actions would be towards lowering the rates. In January 2012, the Reserve Bank signaled a shift in the policy stance towards addressing increasing risks to growth by reversing the tightening cycle. The CRR was reduced cumulatively by 125 bps during January-March 2012 to prepare liquidity conditions for a front-loaded 50 bps reduction in the policy repo rate in April. continue\tto\taddress\tthe\taccentuated\t risks to growth; guard\tagainst\tthe\trisks\tof\tinflation\t pressures re-emerging and adversely impacting\tinflation\texpectations,\t even as corrections in administered prices\trelease\tsuppressed\tinflation;\t and appropriately\tmanage\tliquidity\tto\t ensure\tadequate\tcredit\tflow\tto\tthe\t productive sectors of the economy.

This practice is contrary to the spirit of the Reserve Bank\u2019s guidelines on reasonableness of bank charges. With a view to ensuring that bank customers are treated fairly and reasonably without any discrimination and in a transparent manner at all branches of banks/service delivery locations, banks are advised to: follow\ta\tuniform,\tfair\tand\ttransparent\t pricing policy and not discriminate between their customers at home branch and non-home branches. Detailed guidelines will be issued by end-June 2013. The Basel III Framework on 78. Liquidity Standards includes Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and liquidity risk monitoring tools. The Reserve Bank had issued draft guidelines on Liquidity Risk Management and Basel III Framework on Liquidity Standards in February 2012. After taking into account the feedback received from stakeholders, the guidelines on Liquidity Risk Management were issued in November 2012. These included enhanced guidance on liquidity risk governance, and measurement, monitoring and reporting to the Reserve Bank on liquidity positions. The Basel III liquidity standards were subject to an observation period/revision by the Basel Committee with a view to addressing any unintended consequences that the standards\tmay\thave\tfor\tfinancial\tmarkets,\t credit extension and economic growth. The Reserve Bank indicated in the guidelines on liquidity risk management issued in November 2012 that the guidelines on Basel III liquidity standards will be issued once the Basel Committee finalises\tthe\trelevant\tframework.\tThe\t Basel Committee has issued Basel III: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Liquidity Risk Monitoring Tools in January 2013 and is in the process of finalising the NSFR and disclosure requirements.

The Reserve Bank will issue the final guidelines on Basel III liquidity standards and liquidity risk monitoring tools, taking into account the revisions by the Basel Committee. comments/suggestions received in this regard were under examination and the draft guidelines would be issued by end- January 2013. Accordingly, the draft guidelines were issued on January 31, 2013 for comments till February 28, 2013. Taking into account the comments received, it has been decided to: Detailed guidelines will be issued by end-June 2013. The Reserve Bank issued draft 83. guidelines on \u2018Revisions to the Guidelines on Securitisation Transactions\u2019 in May 2012. The guidelines introduced norms on minimum holding period, minimum retention ratio, loan origination standards and standards of due diligence with regard to securitisation transactions to ensure orderly growth of the Indian securitisation market. While the extant guidelines do not permit reset of credit enhancements during the life of the securities issued by the special purpose vehicle, it was indicated in May 2012 that guidelines on resetting of credit enhancement would be issued separately. Accordingly, it is proposed to: the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight. This relaxation was allowed taking into account the requirement of maintenance of SLR of 25 per cent of DTL under Section 24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 at that time. The SLR requirement has since been brought down to 23 per cent of DTL. Accordingly, it is proposed that: banks\tmay\texceed\tthe\tpresent\tlimit\t of 25 per cent of total investments under the HTM category provided: (a) the excess comprises only of (b) the total SLR securities held in the HTM category is not more than 23 per cent of their DTL as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight, i.e., in alignment with the current SLR requirement. This realignment from 25 per cent to 23 per cent, in line with the recommendations of the Working Group on Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives Markets, would be effected by way of reduction of at least 50 bps every quarter, beginning with the quarter ending June 2013. Detailed guidelines will be issued separately. in February 2013 indicated that the Reserve Bank would prepare a policy discussion paper on the banking structure in India within two months, keeping in view the recommendations of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms, 1998 (Chairman: Shri M.

Rao) had recommended aligning gold import regulations with the rest of imports with a view to reducing gold imports by creating\ta\tlevel\tplaying\tfield\tbetween\t gold imports and other imports. Currently, banks authorised by the Reserve Bank are permitted to import gold on: (i) consignment basis; (ii) unfixed price basis; and (iii) loan basis. Gold is also imported directly by export oriented units (EOUs) / units in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in the gems and jewellery sector and nominated agencies / banks using letters of credit (LCs). The bulk of the gold imported by nominated banks is, however, on consignment basis whereby the nominated banks do not have to fund these stocks. With a view to reducing the demand for gold for domestic use, it is proposed to: restrict\t the\t import\t of\t gold\t on\t consignment basis by banks only to meet the genuine needs of exporters of gold jewellery. Detailed guidelines will be issued by end-May 2013. exchange traded funds and units of gold mutual funds. While there may not be any objection to grant of advances against specially minted gold coins sold by banks, there is a risk that some of these coins would be weighing much more, thereby circumventing the Reserve Bank\u2019s guidelines regarding restrictions on grant of advance against gold bullion. Accordingly, it is proposed to: restrict\tthe\tfacility\t of\t advances\t against the security of gold coins per customer to gold coins weighing up to 50 gms. Detailed guidelines will be issued by end-May 2013. In terms of extant instructions, 99. banks should put in place a proper mechanism to rigorously evaluate the risks arising out of unhedged foreign currency exposure of corporates and price them in the credit risk premium, while also considering stipulating a limit on the unhedged positions of corporates on the basis of banks\u2019 board-approved policy.

The above measures need to be strengthened by requiring the corporates to put in place a risk management policy for their unhedged forex exposures.

", "file10": "stressed and domestic policy changes have not sufficiently improved business conditions. Growth continues to be slack, while in\ufb02 ation concerns, especially in the form of high consumer price in\ufb02 ation linger. Consequently, policy choices will need to be carefully evaluated and would need to preserve stable macroeconomic and \ufb01 nancial conditions while addressing the growth concerns. In this context, structural reforms become important to reduce CAD to sustainable levels and to support growth. Global recovery prospects remain weak regions. Also, the impact of softer commodity prices has been offset in varying degrees for various countries due to depreciation of EMDE currencies vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar. Improvement in aggregate demand requires overcoming high consumer price in\ufb02 ation and infrastructure bottlenecks Global \ufb01 nancial markets have entered into a period of fresh turbulence Slow-paced recovery likely to shape later in 2013-14 The Indian economy continued to remain 6. sluggish in Q4 of 2012-13, though it still maintained a pace faster than most of the EMDEs. The growth in the full year, 2012-13, slipped to 5.0 per cent. The persistence in slowdown is re\ufb02 ected in below trend growth for seventh consecutive quarters since Q2 of 2011- 12. The slowdown has also turned pervasive with most sectors growing below trend. Leading indicators do not suggest immediate improvement in production activity and a slow- paced recovery is likely to shape only later in 2013-14, supported by good monsoon that could shore up rural demand. Aggregate demand of the Indian economy 7. during Q4 of 2012-13 remained slack with little improvement in investment activity and deceleration in consumption demand. Private consumption in real terms has decelerated due to persistent high in\ufb02 ation, while investment is hobbled by structural constraints. Corporate results indicate weak sales growth with corporate investment intentions remaining listless. In this situation, key to turning around the economy lies in re-balancing government spending from current to capital expenditures with a view to crowding-in private investment. Reducing CAD and ensuring its \ufb01 nancing through stable \ufb02 ows are needed Even though the current account de\ufb01 cit 8. (CAD) to GDP ratio moderated to 3.8 per cent in Q4 of 2012-13 from its historic high of 6.5 per cent in Q3 of 2012-13, indications are that it may have widened again in Q1 of 2013-14. Going forward, the current account is expected to show improvement with likelihood that gold imports may fall. However, risks to CAD \ufb01 nancing have increased due to capital out\ufb02 ows from EMDEs. This has put rupee under pressure. Vulnerability indicators of the external sector have deteriorated. In this milieu, concerted policy reforms are needed to reduce CAD and to improve \ufb01 nancing by attracting more stable capital \ufb02 ows to the Indian economy. Policy recalibration became necessary with increased macro-\ufb01 nancial risks guarding against re-emergence of in\ufb02 ation. The transmission of this easing has reduced lending rates signi\ufb01 cantly. There was marked easing in liquidity conditions in Q1 of 2013-14, which broadly remained in line with policy objectives. However, the policy was recalibrated and availability and cost of rupee liquidity was tightened in July 2013, with a view to restoring stability to the foreign exchange market. Broad money (M3) growth remained broadly in line with the indicative trajectory. The deceleration in domestic growth and deterioration in asset quality of the banking sector has kept credit growth below the indicative trajectory in Q1 of 2013-14. Contagion from global bond sell off generates stress in Indian markets momentum in the headline WPI in\ufb02 ation which fell below 5 per cent by May 2013. Non-food manufactured product inflation declined sharply to its lowest level in the past three years. However, food in\ufb02 ation has risen in May and June 2013 and is putting pressures on general price-level. These pressures could moderate somewhat if the monsoon remains on track during the rest of the season. Meanwhile, consumer price in\ufb02 ation remains stubbornly high and recent currency depreciation and upward revisions in fuel prices have increased upside risks to both wholesale and consumer price in\ufb02 ation. Amplifying macro-financial risks warrant cautious monetary policy stance With global growth remaining subdued and structural impediments continuing to hinder recovery at home, the downshift in India\u2019s growth persisted during Q4 of 2012-13. Domestic policy uncertainties, governance concerns, the impact of earlier monetary tightening and slack external demand conditions, apart from a weak monsoon, had weighed down on the growth process for the year as a whole. This brought down growth to a 10-year low of 5.0 per cent during 2012-13. While moderate improvement in growth during 2013-14 is expected, on the back of good monsoon, the downside risks have increased as a result of the global interest rate cycle starting to turn. Global recovery prospects remain weak I.1 Global growth stayed subdued, with improvements in some advanced economies (AEs), especially the US and Japan, getting counterbalanced by slowing growth in key emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), including China and India. Moreover, the prospects of global recovery remains weak. With the global interest rate cycle turning, volatile \ufb01 nancial conditions have emerged that may reduce capital \ufb02 ows to EMDEs. These are likely to affect macro-\ufb01 nancial conditions in EMDEs and may protract their current slow growth. Although currently AEs seem to be on a recovery track, the \ufb01 scal drag continues to be an inhibiting factor. I.2 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its July 2013 update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) has projected that global growth will stay subdued at 3.1 per cent in 2013, the same as in the previous year. This marks a downward revision of 0.2 percentage points from its earlier growth forecast made in April 2013. Growth for 2014 has also been revised downward by 0.2 percentage points to 3.8 per cent. The cuts in forecasts for both the years have been sharper for EMDEs, with a signi\ufb01 cant downgrade of growth projections for Brazil and China. The IMF has projected India to grow at 5.6 per cent in 2013-14 and 6.3 per cent in 2014-15. I.3 During Q1 of 2013, AEs witnessed a multi-paced recovery. US GDP grew at 1.8 per cent (seasonally adjusted annualised quarter- on-quarter growth rate, q-o-q saar), up from 0.4 per cent growth in Q4 of 2012 (Chart I.1a). Growth came from personal consumption expenditure, private inventory investment and residential fixed investment, while cuts in federal, state and local government spendings, as also low exports dragged growth down. Japan\u2019s economy grew at 4.1 per cent in Q1 2013 (q-o-q saar), the fastest pace among G-7 countries, mainly driven by an aggressive monetary and \ufb01 scal stimulus. The UK registered a growth of 2.4 per cent and 1.1 per cent (q-o-q saar) in Q2 and Q1 of 2013, respectively, as against a decline of 0.9 per cent in Q4 of 2012. I.4 In contrast, the euro area (EU-17) continued to be in recession with continued contraction for the sixth consecutive quarter. Its GDP declined by 1.1 per cent (q-o-q saar) in Q1 of 2013 after a 2.4 per cent decline in the previous quarter. France slipped back into recession in Q1, while Italy and Spain continued in a prolonged contraction mode. Germany managed to avert falling into recession with a meagre positive growth of 0.3 per cent (q-o-q saar) during Q1 of 2013. I.5 Among EMDEs, growth has slowed across the BRICS nations which in past had been an engine for global recovery. During Q1 of 2013, growth in Brazil slowed to 2.2 per cent (q-o-q saar), down from 2.6 per cent (q-o-q saar) in the previous quarter (Chart I.1b). Russia\u2019s GDP contracted in Q1 of 2013. China\u2019s GDP growth picked up in Q2 of 2013 to 7.0 per cent (q-o-q saar) from 6.6 per cent in Q1. South Africa slowed to an annualised growth of 0.9 per cent in Q1 of 2013, which was lower than 2.1 per cent in Q4 of 2012. I.6 Apart from GDP growth, labour market conditions have also diverged in the AEs, with a distinct improvement in the US, but continued dampened conditions in the euro area. Non- farm payroll in the US economy increased by 195,000 jobs in June 2013 and the numbers for the previous two months were also revised upwards significantly. Although the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.6 per cent in June due to the improved rate of labour force participation, the overall data suggest that the economy is gaining some traction. However, the unemployment rate in the euro area continues to increase, and touched a new high of 12.2 per cent in May 2013. For some time now, the unemployment rates in Spain and Greece have continued to be anchored around 26 per cent, with their youth unemployment rates at over 55 per cent. Overall, growth and employment have been dented by slow expansion in industrial growth and global trade (Chart I.2). I.7 India\u2019s growth continues to languish. Although India is still growing faster than most EMDEs, the deceleration in growth over the last two years has been marked. The year-on- year (y-o-y) growth, as also the seasonally adjusted growth rate in Q4 of 2012-13, were marginally higher than in the previous quarter, 2.1 Mining & quarrying but were still not indicative of recovery setting in (Table I.1 and Chart I.3). The persistence in slowdown is re\ufb02 ected in below-trend growth for the seventh consecutive quarter since Q2 of 2011-12 (Chart I.4). demand conditions and a weak monsoon, weighed down on the growth process during the year. Agriculture growth is expected to pick up The year 2012-13, as a whole, witnessed I.8 a moderated GDP growth of 5.0 per cent \u2013 the lowest since 2002-03. Domestic policy uncertainties, governance concerns, the impact of earlier monetary tightening, slack external The south-west monsoon of 2013 arrived I.9 on time and is forecasted to be normal by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The progress of the monsoon has also been encouraging, with 29 out of 36 sub-divisions receiving excess or normal rainfall as of July 24, 2013 as against 14 last year. Six of the seven sub-divisions in east and north-east India besides the sub-division of \u2018Haryana and Chandigarh\u2019 have received de\ufb01 cient rainfall so far. However, the temporal and spatial progress of rainfall during the rest of the monsoon season may also in\ufb02 uence the overall size of the kharif crop. In this context, the IMD forecast of normal rainfall during August 2013 at 96 per cent of the long period average (LPA) augurs well for kharif crops. The Reserve Bank\u2019s foodgrains\u2019 production weighted rainfall index for the period June 1 - July 24, 2013 indicate that the rainfall was 17 per cent higher than the long period average compared with 24 per cent de\ufb01 ciency in the same period last year. Kharif sowing until July 26, 2013 was nearly 18 per cent higher than that of the previous year (Table I.2). It was also somewhat higher than the normal area sown at this point of time. Due to heavy rainfall in the current monsoon season so far, storage level of 85 major reservoirs as on July 25, 2013 was 66 per cent higher than the last 10 years\u2019 storage level. Although we are only half way through the monsoon season, it is expected that the performance of the agricultural sector during 2013-14 would be better than last year. I.10 The current stock of rice and wheat, at 73.95 million tonnes, is lower by around 7 million tonnes than during last year, largely due to lower procurement on account of a decline in production and higher off-take under the public distribution system (PDS) during 2012- 13. The higher off-take under PDS is expected to help reduce the prices of cereals, which have remained elevated in recent months. The drawdown of foodgrain stocks would also help reduce the carrying cost and ease the strains on the storage capacity. Although the existing stocks of foodgrain are sufficient, the requirements may have to be re-assessed in light of the expected higher off-take under the National Food Security Bill (NFSB), when implemented. Industrial sector growth remains subdued I.11 The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) nearly stagnated during 2012-13, registering a dismal 1.1 per cent growth on a low base of 2.9 per cent in the preceding year. During April- May 2013, the IIP registered a marginal growth of 0.1 per cent as compared with 0.6 per cent during April-May 2012 (Table I.3). The pervasiveness of the slowdown is reflected across a wide range of industrial classi\ufb01 cations. The contraction of the mining sector and capital goods continues to affect the overall performance of the industrial sector. Excluding capital goods and mining, the growth of the IIP during April- May 2013 was 1.0 per cent (Chart I.5). Excluding volatile items, the truncated IIP (96 per cent of IIP) growth in April-May 2013 was 0.2 per cent (Chart I.6). I.12 Manufacturing sector growth remained almost stagnant during April-May 2013. Important industries such as machinery and equipment, basic metals, fabricated metal products, computing machinery, food products and motor vehicles registered contraction in output during the period. I.13 Persistent power shortages affected the capacity utilisation of the manufacturing sector. As a result, backlogs of work accumulated in the sector. The growth of power generation has remained at 5.3 per cent during April-May 2013. However, going forward, power generation is expected to accelerate during the year with a normal monsoon and capacity additions, although the supply of coal may remain a constraint. I.14 As per the use-based classi\ufb01 cation of industries, with the exception of intermediate goods and consumer non-durables, the growth of all other categories declined during April- May 2013 (Table I.3). The output of consumer durable goods has declined since December 2012, mainly due to a fall in the production of passenger cars and motor-cycles. The contraction of the capital goods sector continued in 2013-14. However, fast-tracking of investment projects is expected to generate higher demand for machinery and construction-related items and is, thus, likely to augment production in the capital goods sector. Supply bottlenecks constraining core industries I.15 Core industries continued to be adversely affected by supply bottlenecks and infrastructure constraints, thereby growing only at 2.4 per cent during April-May 2013-14, which is much lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year. While the output of coal, natural gas, fertilisers and crude oil contracted during the period, there was deceleration in the production of electricity, petroleum re\ufb01 nery products and cement (Chart I.7). I.16 The recent initiatives by the government are expected to somewhat ease supply bottlenecks in the core industrial sector. In particular, the Union Cabinet\u2019s approval for setting up an independent regulatory authority for the coal sector is likely to bene\ufb01 t coal- dependent industries such as power, steel and cement. The envisaged changes in the gas pricing policy will incentivise investment in the Indian upstream sector and help boost production. Also, the target of rolling out `1 trillion worth of PPP projects in the infrastructure sector in the next six months will provide a boost to industry. Capacity utilisation increased I.17 Capacity utilisation (CU), as measured by the 21st Round of the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank, recorded a seasonal increase in Q4 of 2012-13 over the previous quarter (http://www.rbi.org.in/ OBICUS21). However, it remained well below the peaks observed in Q4 of 2010-11 and 2011-12. There is broad co-movement of the CU and de-trended IIP (Chart I.8). Although new orders continued to increase, its growth was lower than in the previous quarter. The raw material inventory to sales ratio, which had been increasing since Q1 of 2012-13, reversed its trend in Q4 of 2012-13, whereas the \ufb01 nished goods inventory to sales ratio increased considerably after reaching its lowest level in the previous quarter. I.18 The services sector recorded the lowest growth in 11 years at 6.8 per cent during 2012- 13. Activity in the \u2018\ufb01 nancing, insurance, real estate & business services\u2019 and \u2018trade, hotels, restaurant, transport & communication\u2019 sectors decelerated. The decline in lead indicators, such as automobile sales, cargo handled at major ports and civil aviation sector, during April-June 2013 signal a further slowdown in the services sector (Table I.4). The Reserve Bank\u2019s services sector composite indicator, which is based on growth in indicators of construction, trade and transport and \ufb01 nance, showed an upturn in Q4 of 2012-13, but indicated a slight fall during April-May 2013 (Chart I.9). Employment scenario weakened during 2011-2013 I.19 There has been a continuous decline in employment generation in the eight key sectors over the years. As per the Labour Bureau Survey, there was a significant decline in employment growth during 2012-13 compared Tourist arrivals Cement Steel Automobile sales Railway revenue-earning freight traf\ufb01 c Cargo handled at major ports Civil Aviation Domestic cargo traf\ufb01 c International cargo traf\ufb01 c International passenger traf\ufb01 c Domestic passenger traf\ufb01 c Note : *: Data refers to April. #: Data refers to April-May.

The Report shows that the CDS unemployment rate has decreased at a higher pace for females than males during 2011-12 over 2009-10. Growth likely to improve at a slow pace with the previous year (Table I.5). The IT/BPO sector, which has been taking the lead in employment generation, performed badly during 2012-13, re\ufb02 ecting the bearish business sentiments across the globe. However, as reported by the Labour Bureau, during January- March 2013, with the exception of transport, all sectors have shown a rise in employment compared with the same period last year. I.20 As per the NSSO 68th Round (2011-12), the unemployment rate in terms of usual principal and subsidiary status (UPSS) increased in 2011-12 to 2.2 per cent (Chart I.10a). On a current daily status (CDS) basis, however, the unemployment rate continued its fall from 6.6 I.21 India\u2019s GDP growth is expected to improve in 2013-14, with recovery expected to take shape as the year progresses. The pace of recovery is, however, likely to be slow in view of the structural constraints. Recent policy measures by the government in various segments, especially in the infrastructure sector, are likely to help improve production activity. Timely, normal and well-spread rainfall will have a positive impact on agriculture production, which, in turn, may improve rural demand for industrial goods and services. The improvement in water storage levels in reservoirs due to heavy rainfall would enable the hydro power sector to enhance capacity utilisation. On the global front, the pick-up in growth in the US and Japan is likely to have a positive impact on global trade. The recent rupee depreciation, augurs well for India\u2019s exports. However, risks to growth in 2013-14 have increased significantly, with prospects that the global interest rate cycle could turnaround and diminish capital in\ufb02 ows to India. Aggregate demand, as re\ufb02 ected on the expenditure side of GDP, remained sluggish during Q4 of 2012-13. Apart from investment, private consumption decelerated, adding to the drag on demand during 2012-13. Depressed private consumption, to a large part, has been the result of high consumer price in\ufb02 ation. Corporate investment intentions also remained languid, re\ufb02 ecting the overall negative business sentiment arising from slack cyclical conditions and structural factors. Corporate sales decelerated during Q4 of 2012-13, while earnings contracted. This, in turn, may have an adverse impact on new investment. In this situation, the key to turning around the economy will be re-balancing government spending from current to capital expenditures with a view to \u2018crowding-in\u2019 private investment. Aggregate demand continued to remain weak II.1 The expenditure-side GDP indicates that the aggregate demand of the Indian economy during Q4 of 2012-13 remained slack (Table II.1). Private \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure, which is the principal component of GDP at market prices, continued to decelerate during the quarter on the back of weak agricultural production and persistent high consumer price inflation. Even so, it remains the largest contributor to growth in aggregate demand (Table II.2). The growth rate of government \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure also moderated during Q4, re\ufb02 ecting \ufb01 scal consolidation efforts. Even though the growth rate of \ufb01 xed investment @: First Revised Estimates. #: Provisional Estimates. Source: Central Statistics Of\ufb01 ce. during Q4 of 2012-13 was slightly higher than in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, aggregate \ufb01 xed investment in the full year decelerated further. Initiatives have started addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, although progress is slow and modernisation of old power plants, improvement of coal and gas supplies, and greater emphasis on power generation from renewable sources. The government has also set up a committee (under the chairmanship of Dr. Vijay Kelkar) to prepare a road map to enhance domestic production of oil & gas. II.2 Infrastructure bottlenecks have been a major factor in India\u2019s low growth. Project implementations are getting delayed due to delays in land acquisition, forest/environment clearances, insurgency problems in mining belts, geological surprises, contractual issues, etc. As on May 1, 2013, nearly half of 566 central sector projects (of `1.5 billion and above) got delayed due to these problems, for which cost overruns are estimated to be around 18.2 per cent. II.3 To address these issues, the government has taken several initiatives. For speedy clearance of projects, in addition to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure (CCI), a Project Monitoring Group (PMG) has been set up by the Prime Minister\u2019s Of\ufb01 ce (PMO) with the objective of resolving hurdles facing mega projects (above `10 billion). II.5 With regard to road projects, the response to the PPP mode of road building remained poor. Several projects have not elicited bids. The developers have been facing a severe shortage of equity and, consequently, are unable to raise the required debt. The government has decided to adopt the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode for national highways which are not viable on a PPP basis. However, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affair\u2019s (CCEA) decisions in June 2013 to facilitate harmonious substitution of concessionaire in ongoing and completed National Highway projects and insulating the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) from heavy \ufb01 nancial claims and unnecessary disputes are likely to expedite the implementation of road projects. II.4 In the power sector, the government has initiated several measures, such as renovation II.6 With the cancellation of 2G licences in February 2012, the telecommunications sector has been struggling, with a noticeable decline in investor interest. However, investor interest is expected to improve once the recent decision by the Telecom Commission approving 100 per cent FDI in the sector gets rati\ufb01 ed. Corporate investment intentions remain subdued II.7 Corporate investment intentions remain subdued. Additionally, some of the institutionally assisted projects which received sanction in 2010-11 and 2011-12 have been cancelled. The aggregate project cost envisaged from new projects for which assistance was sanctioned by major banks/FIs, aggregated `2.0 trillion in 2012-13 and remained almost at the same level as that of the previous year (`1.9 trillion) but signi\ufb01 cantly below that in 2010-11 (`3.8 trillion) (Table II.3). An industry-wise analysis revealed that during Q4 of 2012-13, the share of envisaged expenditure on new projects is the highest in the metal & metal products sector (56.0 per cent), followed by the power industry (30.0 per cent) (Chart II.1). further in Q4 of 2012-13 to 4.1 per cent (Table II.4). The decline in sales was more distinct in the case of motor vehicles, electricity Sales growth remained sluggish during Q4 of 2012-13 II.8 Sales growth for listed Non-Government Non-Financial (NGNF) companies decelerated Note: Based on data reported by 39 banks/FIs. *: Data are provisional.

Based on the available annual results of 621 non- government non-financial public limited companies, leverage is observed to have increased further in 2012-13. generation and supply, iron & steel and real estate. In tandem with the slow growth in sales, net pro\ufb01 ts went down in Q4 of 2012-13 due to higher employee expenses and lower support from other income. Sequentially (q-o-q), however, net pro\ufb01 t recorded an improvement in Q4 (Table II.5). Further, pro\ufb01 tability in terms of EBITDA and EBIT margins improved marginally in Q4 in comparison with the previous quarter. The net profit margin, however, recorded a marginal decline. Inventory accumulation (as re\ufb02 ected in change in stock- in-trade to sales ratio), which went up in Q2 of 2012-13, has reverted to earlier levels (Chart II.2). Early results for Q1 of 2013-14 suggest that sales growth has decelerated further.

Fiscal consolidation resumed during 2012- 13 mainly through expenditure cutbacks Tax collection remains weak during 2013- 14 so far II.10 The central government restricted its gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit (GFD) to 4.9 per cent of GDP during 2012-13, less than the budget estimate of 5.1 per cent (Table II.7). The containment in GFD, despite lower tax and non-tax revenues, was achieved mainly through a cutback in plan expenditure. Non-plan expenditure, on the other hand, was higher due to a sharp increase in expenditure on the revenue account. Subsidies on food, fertilisers and petroleum accounted for 2.5 per cent of GDP as against the 1.8 per cent that had been budgeted for the year. Overall, the revenue expenditure as a proportion of GDP was lower than the budget estimate by 0.3 percentage points, although it could not offset the shortfall in revenue receipts, which resulted in a higher revenue de\ufb01 cit. II.11 During April-May 2013, key de\ufb01 cits of the Centre as percentages to budget estimates were higher than in the corresponding period of last year. The widening of the revenue de\ufb01 cit and higher capital expenditure resulted in a higher gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit during April-May 2013 than a year ago. II.12 The revenue de\ufb01 cit as a percentage to budget estimate during April-May 2013 was higher due to both higher revenue expenditure and lower tax revenues. Gross tax revenue in absolute terms declined mainly due to a decline in revenues from corporation tax and union excise duties. The collection of income tax and service tax as percentages to budget estimates were also lower than a year ago. II.13 Total expenditure, as a percentage of the budget estimate in the \ufb01 rst two months (April- May) of 2013-14, was higher than a year ago, mainly due to higher plan and capital expenditure, which registered growth rates of 52.6 per cent and 48.9 per cent, respectively, over April-May 2012. On the other hand, despite higher payments of subsidies, non-plan expenditure in the revenue account, was lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year. II.14 If the government\u2019s revenues fall short of the target due to slowdown in growth, a cutback in expenditure will be required to achieve the budgeted fiscal deficit. It is, therefore, important to contain subsidies and re-prioritise expenditure towards plan and capital expenditures, thereby enhancing the growth prospects of the economy. @: Includes external debt at current exchange rates. #: Pertains to revised estimates. *: Data in respect of states pertains to 26 state governments, of State \ufb01 nances expected to remain on the consolidation track which one is Vote on Account.

The revenue account at the consolidated level recorded a surplus in 2012-13 (RE), albeit lower than budgeted. II.16 The consolidated position of the state governments for 2013-141 is budgeted to show an increase in the revenue surplus-GDP ratio and a marginal improvement in the GFD-GDP ratio. The surplus in revenue account would be achieved by a reduction in the revenue expenditure-GDP ratio, while the revenue receipts-GDP ratio is budgeted to remain unchanged from the previous year\u2019s level. The expenditure pattern of the states shows that while the development expenditure-GDP ratio is budgeted to decline, the non-development expenditure-GDP ratio is budgeted to increase marginally during 2013-14. However, the capital outlay-GDP ratio is budgeted to be higher in 2013-14 than in 2012-13 (RE). Per cent to GDP Combined government \ufb01 nances budgeted to improve in 2013-14 II.17 Data on combined \ufb01 nances show that the revenue de\ufb01 cit and \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit as ratios to GDP in 2012-13 (RE) were lower by 0.6 percentage points and 0.2 percentage points, respectively, over the previous year. The decline in the combined GFD-GDP ratio was entirely on account of the lower \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit of the Centre (Table II.7). In 2013-14, the combined \ufb01 scal position is budgeted to improve further on account of \ufb01 scal plans of both the Centre and the states (Table II.8). Need to keep the momentum of the \ufb01 scal consolidation and increase government investment in productive sectors II.18 The government\u2019s \ufb01 scal consolidation process has contributed to improving the state of public \ufb01 nances in India at a critical juncture. The low collection of both tax and non-tax revenue during 2012-13 complicated the task of reducing fiscal imbalances. Thus, the containment of GFD in 2012-13 was brought about by expenditure compression on plan revenue account and also plan and non-plan capital account. The cuts in union government\u2019s capital expenditure were undertaken at a time when private investment had already decelerated. This raised concerns about the quality of \ufb01 scal consolidation. It is, therefore, important for the Centre to take steps to contain its non-plan revenue expenditure within the limit set in the Union Budget 2013-14 through subsidy reforms. Staying on the path of fiscal consolidation in the current year, however, remains challenging. Moderation in aggregate demand poses risks to budgetary projections for revenue. The recent exchange rate depreciation has compounded the problems in restraining subsidies. At the present juncture, it is important that the government restrains its subsidy commitments, strikes a judicious balance under its various budgetary heads by increasing investment in the productive sectors so as to crowd-in private investments. Tax reforms also need to be expedited to improve the tax/GDP ratio. 1 Based on budget documents of 26 state government for 2013-14 of which one is Vote on Account. India\u2019s external sector imbalances have persisted and brought the rupee under pressure. Despite the moderation in the current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD) in Q4 of 2012-13, it remained above the sustainable level. The trade gap widened during Q1 of 2013-14 compared with Q1 of 2012-13. Exports contracted in Q1, while gold imports increased signi\ufb01 cantly. With uptrend in US yields, portfolio out\ufb02 ows since mid-May 2013 have caused the rupee to depreciate sharply against the US dollar. This was, however, broadly in line with other EMDE currencies, which also weakened as \ufb01 nancial markets across the globe re-priced risks. Going forward, the CAD is expected to moderate in 2013-14. However, volatile markets and the potential tapering of quantitative easing in the US pose a risk to CAD \ufb01 nancing. External sector policies would need to be carefully calibrated over the short to medium term with a view to containing the CAD within manageable levels and \ufb01 nancing it through more stable \ufb02 ows. Global trade remains subdued III.1 With global growth remaining weak, world trade has remained subdued. The exports of many EMDEs, viz., Brazil, Russia, Malaysia and Indonesia, have contracted in recent months (Table III.1). The subdued trend in Chinese export growth in May and June 2013, coupled with signs of its economic activity slowing, has further dimmed the prospects of global trade expansion. III.2 India followed the trend of major EMDEs with a decline in its exports during Q1 of 2013. Improving export growth during 2013-14 will remain a challenge given the subdued prospects of global trade expansion. The IMF, in its July 2013 update of the WEO, has lowered the growth projection of world trade volume for 2013 by 0.5 percentage points to 3.1 per cent. electronics and iron ore sectors were the main contributors to the decline in exports in Q1 of 2013-14 (Chart III.1). III.4 In contrast, imports grew by 6.0 per cent in Q1 of 2013-14 as against a decline of 5.7 per cent in Q1 of 2012-13. Gold imports have almost doubled from US$9.2 billion in Q1 of 2012-13 to US$ 17.9 billion in Q1 of 2013-14. Notwithstanding a fall of 5.7 per cent in international crude oil prices (Indian basket) in Q1 of 2013-14 (y-o-y), POL imports grew by 6.4 per cent. Non-oil non-gold imports continued Trade de\ufb01 cit continues to be a concern in Q1 of 2013-14 III.3 Trends in exports and imports in Q1 of 2013-14 suggest a widening of the merchandise trade de\ufb01 cit. The trade de\ufb01 cit widened from US$ 42.2 billion in Q1 of 2012-13 to US$ 50.2 billion in Q1 of 2013-14, mainly on account of a sharp increase in gold imports. Re\ufb02 ecting global demand conditions, exports contracted in May and June 2013 after recording growth for \ufb01 ve consecutive months (since December 2012). The engineering goods, gems & jewellery, to show contraction, reflecting subdued domestic growth conditions. Apart from gold and POL, the rise in imports of pearls, precious & semi-precious stones, non-ferrous metals and electronic goods also contributed to higher imports in Q1 of 2013-14 (Table III.2). CAD narrowed significantly in Q4 of 2012-13 III.5 The current account deficit (CAD) moderated sharply to 3.6 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 2012-13 from 6.5 per cent in Q3 (4.4 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 2011-12). This was owing to the narrowing of the merchandise trade de\ufb01 cit underpinned by a pick-up in exports and a decline in imports (BoP basis) in Q4. However, net service exports remained subdued in Q4. The moderation in net secondary income compared with Q4 of 2011-12 mainly re\ufb02 ected a fall in net private remittances from abroad. Further, there was a significant outflow on account of income payments, re\ufb02 ecting growing liability-servicing obligations (Table III.3). cent of GDP was far above the sustainable level (Table III.3). Trends in trade data suggest that the CAD may remain high in Q1 of 2013-14. However, in subsequent quarters, the CAD is expected to improve, since the import demand for gold may moderate. The global price of gold has declined sharply, partly due to US dollar appreciation and signs of recovery in the US economy. With the end of the gold super-cycle, the speculative demand for gold is likely to decline. Besides, various measures have been undertaken domestically to curb import demand for gold, that inter alia include (i) a hike in customs duty to 8 per cent and (ii) measures towards rationalisation of gold imports by both nominated agencies and banks. of export and fresh imports of gold is permitted only after 75 per cent of the retained gold is actually exported. This new measure replaced the earlier restrictions on import of gold on consignment basis and opening letters of credit subject to 100 per cent cash margin. To some extent, the recently launched in\ufb02 ation-linked bonds may also wean away investors who use gold as a hedge against in\ufb02 ation. If the current recovery in the US and Japan continues, it may help improve India\u2019s exports to these destinations. The combined in\ufb02 uence of these factors may augur well for India\u2019s CAD during 2013-14. Capital \ufb02 ows became volatile III.7 In particular, on July 22, 2013, all nominated banks / agencies were instructed to ensure that at least one \ufb01 fth of every lot of import of gold (in any form/purity) is retained in customs bonded warehouses for the purpose III.8 Although net capital \ufb02 ows moderated in Q4 of 2012-13, they were adequate to \ufb01 nance the CAD, and indeed there was net accretion of US$ 2.7 billion in India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves during this period. The lower net capital \ufb02 ows in Q4 of 2012-13 were mainly due of which: Change in Reserves 14. Errors & Omissions -(11+12+13) Memo: As a ratio to GDP 15. Trade Balance 16. Net Services 17.

Net FDI flows were, however, signi\ufb01 cantly higher in Q4 of 2012-13 than in the preceding quarter (Table III.4). Fed signals that raised the prospects of global interest rates hardening, shifts in yield spreads and the elevated cost of hedging a volatile rupee (Chart III.2). III.9 Trends to date in 2013-14 suggest an uptrend in capital \ufb02 ows in the form of FDI and NRI deposits, while ECBs showed a decline as compared with previous quarter (Table III.5). Net FII \ufb02 ows were substantial until the third week of May 2013, followed by a signi\ufb01 cant out\ufb02 ow in the subsequent period. Since the last week of May 2013, there was a net out\ufb02 ow of US$ 12.1 billion on account of FIIs (till July 18). The reversal of FII \ufb02 ows from the domestic market was mainly evident in the debt segment. The out\ufb02 ows of FIIs from the domestic debt market was led by the global bond sell-offs on de\ufb01 cit drove the rupee to a new low of `61.05 against the dollar on July 8, 2013. III.11 The Reserve Bank\u2019s measures on July 15, 2013 to address exchange rate volatility helped stabilise the rupee subsequently. The government\u2019s announcement on July 16, 2013 proposing to liberalise FDI in single brand retail, petroleum and natural gas, defence production and some other sectors also improved sentiments and work towards bring some stability to the rupee. Rupee depreciated signi\ufb01 cantly in Q1 of 2013-14 III.10 In line with most EMDEs, the Indian rupee depreciated by around 9 per cent during Q1 of 2013-14 (Chart III.3). The Rupee appreciated in April 2013, but the trend reversed from the start of May, with dollar gaining strength on better growth prospects. Wider trade de\ufb01 cit and rising gold imports also put pressure on the rupee. Since the Fed Chairman\u2019s May 22, 2013, testimony the rupee depreciated signi\ufb01 cantly (by 7.5 per cent) till July 15 as global investors began unwinding their risky positions in emerging markets, anticipating that the US Fed could begin tapering its asset purchases. The dollar strengthening against major currencies, coupled with widening trade III.12 In terms of the real exchange rate, as at the end of Q1 of 2013-14, the 6-currency and 36-currency REER showed depreciation of 9.0 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively, over March 2013, re\ufb02 ecting weakening of the rupee in nominal terms (Table III.6). External debt rose further in Q4 of 2012- 13 III.13 The widening CAD, \ufb01 nanced through higher debt \ufb02 ows, resulted in a signi\ufb01 cant rise in India\u2019s external debt during 2012-13 (Chart III.4). India\u2019s external debt stood at US$ 390 billion at end-March 2013. There has been a sizeable rise in external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and rupee-denominated non-resident Indian deposits. Short-term debts, on residual maturity basis have surged by about US$ 25 NEER: Nominal Effective Exchange Rate. REER: Real Effective Exchange Rate. P: Provisional. Note: Rise in indices indicates appreciation of the rupee and vice provisioning requirements for corporates that have unhedged foreign currency exposure and issued draft guidelines for the same. Vulnerability indicators show further worsening billion in 2012-13 (Table III.7). In view of the rise in external debt and shortening maturities, there is a need to keep a close vigil on external debt levels and its components, especially private corporate debt. In this milieu, the Reserve Bank has proposed to levy capital and III.14 With rising debt and deceleration in GDP growth, external sector vulnerability increased in 2012-13 compared with the previous year. India\u2019s external debt to GDP ratio increased to 21.2 per cent at end-March 2013 from 19.7 per cent at end-March 2012. Moreover, the ratio of short-term debt (both original and residual maturity) to total external debt increased further at end-March 2013. The ratio of reserves to total debt deteriorated through 2012-13 and stood at 74.9 per cent by the end of March 2013. Re\ufb02 ecting widening CAD, the net international investment position (IIP) as a ratio to GDP worsened from (\u2013)14 per cent at end-March 2012 to (\u2013)16.7 per cent at end-March 2013 (Table III.8). PR: Partially Revised, P: Provisional, #: RBI Estimate. Note: Growth rates are based on data up to 3 decimal points. CAD may moderate in 2013-14, but risks to its \ufb01 nancing remain III.15 The CAD narrowed somewhat in Q4, but it remained above the sustainable level. It is likely that the widening trade de\ufb01 cit in Q1 of 2013-14 compared with the corresponding period of the previous year may manifest in a wider CAD in the quarter. However, the CAD could moderate over subsequent quarters if gold imports show signi\ufb01 cant contraction, global crude oil prices stay low and exports get some support from global recovery. Nevertheless, the CAD is likely to stay signi\ufb01 cantly higher than the sustainable level of 2.5 per cent. As such, a strategy aiming at its reduction and at the same time ensuring its \ufb01 nancing with stable and non- debt resources, such as FDI will be necessary. It is also important to remove structural impediments constraining India\u2019s export competitiveness and to sustain non-debt- creating \ufb02 ows over the medium term. III.16 There are certain global risks that call for appropriate policy attention. International crude oil prices, though showing a downtrend since February 2013, would largely be impacted by the outlook on global growth, geo-political uncertainties and supply-side factors. High remittances underpinned by significant depreciation of the rupee in recent months and anticipated recovery in source countries may attenuate concerns relating to \ufb01 nancing the CAD. However, the most important risk is that at some stage, exit from accommodative monetary policy in the US may tighten global liquidity, with implications for capital \ufb02 ows to EMDEs, including India. The resulting volatile capital \ufb02 ows could impede smooth \ufb01 nancing of the CAD in 2013-14. In this context, continued policy reforms assume utmost importance to ensure a conducive economic and business environment to attract more stable capital \ufb02 ows to the Indian economy. With moderation in headline in\ufb02 ation, the Reserve Bank eased the repo rate by 25 basis points in May 2013 on top of a 100 bps rate cut during 2012-13. During Q1 of 2013-14, liquidity conditions improved considerably and broad money growth broadly remained in line with the indicative trajectory. Credit growth decelerated with the slack in economic activity and deterioration in asset quality. The Reserve Bank took a slew of measures during July 2013 with a view to alter monetary and liquidity conditions and thereby to restore stability in the forex market. Going forward, the monetary policy will be conditioned by the need to maintain stable macro-economic environment by moving towards attaining external and internal balance and to support growth, while anchoring in\ufb02 ation expectations. The Reserve Bank undertakes monetary policy measures to curb forex volatility IV.1 The stance of the Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary policy for 2013-14 has been shaped to address risks to growth and guard against re-emergence of in\ufb02 ation while maintaining overall macro-\ufb01 nancial stability. On the back of empirical evidence that inflation below threshold level is conducive to sustained growth, the Reserve Bank has emphasised low and stable in\ufb02 ation in promoting growth over the long term. In 2012-13, after frontloading a 50 bps policy rate reduction, the Reserve Bank strived to address sluggish credit growth and tight liquidity conditions with a series of calibrated measures that included cuts in the CRR and SLR and `1.5 trillion in outright OMO purchases, besides large accommodation provided through LAF repos. With headline inflation moderating, the Reserve Bank reduced the repo rate by 25 bps in May 2013, over and above the 50 bps reduction in Q4 of 2012-13. With capital out\ufb02 ows, wide current account deficit and high consumer price in\ufb02 ation the Reserve Bank kept the repo rate unchanged in the mid-quarter review of the monetary policy, 2013-14 (Table IV.1) subsequently, in order to restore stability in the forex market, the Reserve Bank has taken several measures since mid-July 2013, which, include: (i) hike in Marginal Standing Facility rate/Bank Rate; (ii) restriction on banks\u2019 access to funds under LAF repo; (iii) OMO sales; (iv) maintenance of minimum daily CRR balances by SCBs at 99 per cent of the requirement; (v) capping of PDs\u2019 access to LAF at 100 per cent of their individual net owned funds; and (vi) restrictions on gold import. loans were visible in the commercial vehicle segment and housing loans under both personal and commercial segments. IV.3 During Q1 of 2013-14, with the increase in the government\u2019s spending, liquidity conditions eased. Moreover, the Reserve Bank conducted two OMO purchase auctions during the \ufb01 rst quarter, injecting liquidity to the tune of `165 billion. An increase in the currency in circulation and in banks\u2019 excess balances maintained with the Reserve Bank led to the withdrawal of liquidity from the banking system during the quarter (Chart IV.1(a) and (b)). IV.2 Cumulatively, there has been a 125 bps reduction in the policy rate since the start of 2012-13. The transmission of monetary easing enabled the Weighted Average Lending Rates (WALR) based on all borrowal accounts to decline by 41 bps during 2012-13 (Table IV.2). The modal deposit rate and the modal base rate of the banks declined by 11 bps and 50 bps, respectively. More recent data suggest that the WALR of fresh rupee loans sanctioned by reporting banks declined considerably during April-June 2013. The softening of rates on fresh Liquidity conditions eased in Q1 of 2013-14 IV.4 Liquidity condition improved in April 2013, which was followed by a marginal increase in the liquidity de\ufb01 cit during May 2013 mainly on account of an increase in the currency in circulation. Liquidity conditions again improved in June 2013, with the liquidity de\ufb01 cit staying within the Reserve Bank\u2019s comfort zone of (\u20131) per cent of NDTL, despite quarter-end advance tax out\ufb02 ows from the banking system. Banks\u2019 recourse to liquidity from the Reserve Bank\u2019s LAF window also moderated as credit growth decelerated. Consequently, the incremental credit-deposit ratio has declined in Q1 of 2013-14 and the gap between deposit and credit has closed (Chart IV.2). IV.5 Re\ufb02 ecting the comfortable liquidity conditions in Q1 of 2013-14, SCBs took recourse to MSF on only four occasions during the quarter and borrowed around `20 billion. IV.6 However, global financial market developments following the signalling on likely tapering of QE in the US brought new risks to the fore, prompting monetary policy to recalibrate towards addressing them. The Fed signals triggered outflows of portfolio investment, particularly from the debt segment. This has led to signi\ufb01 cant depreciation of the rupee since end-May 2013. IV.7 In face of rupee volatility the Reserve Bank announced measures on July 15, 2013 to restore stability to the foreign exchange market that had effects on the inter-bank liquidity. The MSF rate was re-calibrated at 300 basis points above the policy repo rate under the LAF. Further, the overall allocation of funds under LAF was capped at 1.0 per cent of the Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) of the banking system, with the cap reckoned at `750 billion. The Reserve Bank also conducted open market sales of G-secs withdrawing liquidity to the tune of `25 billion on July 18, 2013. IV.8 While the above set of measures had a restraining effect on volatility with a concomitant stabilising effect on the exchange rate, based on a review of these measures, and an assessment of the liquidity and overall market conditions going forward, it was decided on July 23, 2013 to modify the liquidity tightening measures. The modi\ufb01 ed norms have set the overall limit for access to LAF by each individual bank at 0.5 per cent of its own NDTL outstanding as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight effective from July 24, 2013. Moreover, effective from the \ufb01 rst day of the fortnight beginning from July 27, 2013 banks will be required to maintain a minimum daily CRR balance of 99 per cent of the average fortnightly requirement. IV.10 On the sources side, the path of reserve money was in\ufb02 uenced by both developments in the net domestic asset (NDA) and net foreign assets (NFA). In Q1, the Reserve Bank\u2019s net credit to the Centre increased because of the decline in the government\u2019s cash balances. However, this increase was matched by a decline in the LAF, which partially offset reserve money growth. The NFA, adjusted for revaluation, recorded a marginal decline over the quarter. On the components side, the expansion was matched by an increase in currency in circulation and in bankers\u2019 deposits. Broad money growth remained broadly in line with indicative trajectory Reserve money adjusted for CRR changes grew at a reasonable pace IV.9 During Q1 of 2013-14, y-o-y growth of reserve money picked up and was at 7.0 per cent compared with 5.6 per cent in Q1 of the previous \ufb01 nancial year. Growth in currency in circulation decelerated, re\ufb02 ecting the impact of the economic slowdown. Bankers\u2019 deposits with the Reserve Bank, after having a negative y-o-y growth for 2012-13 mainly because of CRR cuts, recorded a low but positive y-o-y growth in Q1 of 2013-14. The reserve money, adjusted for the CRR changes, recorded a y-o-y growth at 10.2 per cent in Q1 of 2013-14 (Chart IV.3). IV.11 The y-o-y M3 growth at 12.8 per cent was broadly in line with the indicative trajectory of 13.0 per cent for the 2013-14 (Chart IV.4). On the components side, a deceleration was observed in both the currency with the public and aggregate deposits. On the sources side, there was a marked deceleration in bank credit to the commercial sector as well as net bank credit to the government. IV.12 The aggregate deposit growth, which generally decelerated during 2012-13 on account of near-zero real interest rates, continued to decelerate in Q1 of 2013-14 even with the increase in WPI-adjusted real interest rates on deposits. During Q1 of 2013-14, the modal deposit rate of banks declined marginally by 5 bps, following a reduction in the repo rate and easing of liquidity conditions. The large increase in import of gold during Q1 of 2013- 14 could indicate that some part of household savings was channelised to purchase the yellow metal, taking advantage of its lower prices. Time deposits, the largest component of aggregate deposits, decelerated further in Q1 of 2013-14 compared with the previous year (Table IV.3 and Chart IV.5). growth remained below the Reserve Bank\u2019s indicative trajectory. On the demand side, the deceleration in domestic growth adversely affected the demand for credit in India. The deterioration in credit quality, on the other hand, impeded the supply of domestic credit (Table IV.4). The deceleration was observed across all bank groups, being high for PSBs and private sector banks, which jointly account for above 90 per cent of the SCB credit. Risk aversion impacting credit, as asset quality concerns persist Besides sluggish demand, a major IV.14 factor that could have led to the low credit Note: 1. Data are provisional. growth of public sector banks (PSBs) over the past quarters relates to deterioration in their asset quality. Asset quality indicators of the banking sector, which had suffered signi\ufb01 cantly during 2011-12, worsened in 2012-13. Although data indicate worsening asset quality across bank groups during 2012-13, it continued to be led by public sector banks (PSBs), which account for the major portion of bank advances (Table IV.5) Deterioration in both asset quality and in macroeconomic conditions resulted in risk aversion in the banking sector. in all major sectors (viz., agriculture, industry and services), except for personal loans. The y-o-y bank credit growth to industry moderated to 14.1 per cent in June 2013 from 20.7 per cent in June 2012. Deceleration in credit growth to industry was observed in all the major sub- sectors, barring food processing, textiles, leather & leather products, cement & cement products and infrastructure. Credit growth to industry excluding infrastructure was much lower, at 11.7 per cent in June 2013 compared with 22.4 per cent a year ago. Sectoral deployment of credit indicates deceleration across most sectors IV.15 An analysis of the sectoral deployment of credit based on data from select banks (which cover 95 per cent of total non-food credit extended by all SCBs) for June 2013 reveals that deceleration in credit growth was observed IV.16 During 2013-14 so far (up to July 12, 2013), the estimated total \ufb02 ow of \ufb01 nancial resources from banks and non-banks, including external sources, to the commercial sector was slightly higher compared with the same period last year. Despite a decline in non-SLR investments by banks the \ufb02 ow of resources from banks was marginally higher due to increase in non-food credit by SCBs. Flow of resources from foreign sources was higher due to external commercial borrowings / FCCBs and higher foreign direct investment to India. The domestic non-bank sources declined on account of decrease in net issuance of CPs subscribed by non-banks, total gross accommodation by four Reserve Bank regulated AIFIs and net-investment by LIC (Table IV.6). Monetary policy to aim at stable macro- \ufb01 nancial conditions IV.17 The Reserve Bank, through its monetary policy, has been aiming to achieve a low and stable in\ufb02 ation environment that is conducive to growth. In this endeavour, during 2012-13 the Reserve Bank reduced the repo rate by 100 bps and injected liquidity through CRR and SLR cuts as also through OMOs. In continuation of its stance, the Reserve Bank in May 2013 reduced the repo rate by 25 bps and injected liquidity through OMOs during the \ufb01 rst quarter of 2013-14. The transmission of the rate easing lowered nominal lending rates signi\ufb01 cantly in 2012-13. However, global currency market movements in June-July 2013 have prompted a re-calibration of monetary policy. Going forward, the Reserve Bank will endeavour to actively manage liquidity to reinforce monetary transmission that is consistent with the growth- in\ufb02 ation balance and macro-\ufb01 nancial stability. It will also endeavour to maintain stable conditions by moving towards attaining external and internal balance. Global \ufb01 nancial markets have experienced renewed turbulence, especially since the latter half of May 2013, following the Fed\u2019s signalling on tapering off of quantitative easing. Taking the cue that the global interest rate cycle may reverse, \ufb01 nancial markets witnessed bond sell-offs across the globe. Financial markets in EMDEs came under intense pressure as the sell-off led to portfolio out\ufb02 ows from emerging markets, including India. Consequently, yields hardened and exchange rates depreciated against the US dollar. The Reserve Banks\u2019s policy intervention helped curb rupee volatility but money markets rates \ufb01 rmed up. The primary market witnessed an improvement in resource mobilisation during the quarter. However, the risk of volatile and tight \ufb01 nancial conditions arising ahead remains. Spillovers from the Fed\u2019s forward guidance on exit from QE brings global \ufb01 nancial markets under stress V.1 During 2012 and early 2013, global bond and equity markets had signi\ufb01 cantly rallied following central banks\u2019 massive quantitative easing (QE) programmes in advanced economies. Though global growth remained sluggish, the risk appetite improved and the markets aggressively priced the perceived reduction in risks. However, during Q1 of 2013- 14, particularly in May and June, the global financial markets experienced renewed turbulence. This followed the signalling by the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve on May 22, 2013 that the Fed may taper off its asset purchase programme if economic conditions improve rapidly. The signal was followed by a more explicit forward guidance by the Fed Chairman on June 19, 2013 on moderating its asset purchases starting later this year and, in measured steps, unwinding the QE by mid- 2014. The subsequent statement by the Fed of a \u2018highly accommodative\u2019 monetary policy in July appears to have calmed the market to a large extent. turning thus posing the prospects of signi\ufb01 cant losses on existing bond holdings. Consequently, there was a large sell-off in US treasuries as well as bonds all over the globe. Asian markets came under intense pressure as the bond sell-off was accompanied by the reverse \ufb02 ight of capital back into the US. While bond markets in the US had started pricing the exit from ultra-easy monetary policy even before the Fed signalling (Chart V.2), the yields in EMDEs rose sharply following the testimony (Chart V.3a). V.2 It may be observed in this context that the balance sheets of central banks in advanced economies have expanded signi\ufb01 cantly since the inception of the crisis in 2007 (Chart V.1). Therefore, the Fed\u2019s signal of an exit from QE raised the prospects of the global interest cycle V.3 In the euro area, the Cyprus crisis receded following the bail-out in March 2013 and gold sales in April 2013. Portugal, however, emerged as a troubled spot during Q1 of 2013-14, raising fresh doubts whether the improved terms for sovereign borrowings for Spain and Italy could be sustained. Portugal\u2019s sovereign debt is seen inter-bank markets also adversely impacted the sentiments across equity markets in Asia and the Paci\ufb01 c region (Chart V.4). Rupee depreciates in response to Fed announcements rising over the next three years and re\ufb01 nancing dif\ufb01 culties are expected to recur. Euro area periphery bond spreads also widened (Chart V.3b). The ECB President commented that the central bank \u201cwill stay accommodative for the foreseeable future\u201d and that it was open to \u201call other possible instruments\u201d, adding that an exit from accommodative policy remained \u201cdistant\u201d. This helped in calming markets. However, the euro area sovereign debt and banking sector fragilities remain an important risk for global \ufb01 nancial stability. V.5 Following the Fed Chairman\u2019s response on May 22, 2013, the rupee depreciated by 5.8 per cent until July 26, 2013. The rupee touched an all-time low of 61.05 against the dollar on July 8, 2013, when Reserve Bank instructed authorised dealers to stop taking proprietary trading in currency futures or exchange-traded currency options markets. While speculative positions on the exchange came down as a result, the OTC segment of the foreign exchange market continued to face volatility. The rupee depreciation since May 22 had touched 7.5 per cent by July 15, 2013. Faced with large volatility, the Reserve Bank stepped in on July 15, 2013 to address it through liquidity monetary measures. It also took additional measures on July 23, 2013. These measures imparted stability. Subsequent to the measures, the rupee has appreciated 1.9 per cent against the US dollar till July 26, 2013. V.4 As portfolio capital, especially in bond markets, witnessed out\ufb02 ows from EMDEs, their currencies came under severe pressure. This, in turn, added to the sell-offs in the equity markets by global investors, especially in EMDE markets. The liquidity crunch in the Chinese V.6 Other EMDE currencies also depreciated considerably after the Fed announcement, including those for countries with current account surpluses (Chart V.5). During 2013-14 (up to July 24, 2013), the currency depreciation was highest in case of Brazil, followed by India and Domestic markets respond to liquidity tightening measures MSF limit of 0.5 per cent being available only for the Special Repo window. The Reserve Bank conducted the OMO sale auction of G-secs for `120 billion on July 18, 2013. However, given the bidding pattern and the market yields, it accepted bids for `25 billion only. V.7 Subsequent to the measures taken on July 15, 2013, which were unanticipated for the market, G-sec yields and corporate bond yields \ufb01 rmed up. Overnight rates, after an initial jump, subsided. Liquidity tightened and amidst tighter liquidity, the Reserve Bank announced a Special Repo window for a noti\ufb01 ed amount of `250 billion to enable banks to lend to mutual funds. In addition, the borrowing limit below the stipulated SLR requirement under the MSF was raised from 2.0 per cent of NDTL to 2.5 per cent of NDTL for a temporary period, with the higher V.8 The situation in the money market was quite comfortable during the \ufb01 rst half of July 2013. However, the measures taken by the Reserve Bank on July 15 and July 23, 2013 to contain exchange rate volatility impacted the money market. The call rate, which stood at 7.21 per cent prior to the Reserve Bank\u2019s policy measures on July 15, 2013, initially increased to 8.53 per cent on July 16, 2013 but subsequently came down to 7.14 per cent on July 23, 2013. However, announcement of additional measures by Reserve Bank on July 23, 2013 led to hardening of call rate to around 9.05 per cent on July 24, 2013. The rates in the collateralised segment also hardened as a result of these measures, with the CBLO rate increasing to 8.68 per cent on July 24, 2013. CD and CP rates also hardened. It subsequently reverted to the level prior to the measures. V.9 Earlier, the money markets in India remained orderly during Q1 of 2013-14, with the call rates hovering within the corridor set by the reverse repo and the MSF rate and remaining close to the policy (Repo) rate. Re\ufb02 ecting a moderate easing of liquidity, the daily weighted average call rate declined to 7.53 per cent during April 2013 from 7.90 per cent during March 2013. The reduction in the repo rate in the Annual Monetary Policy Statement, 2013-14 (May 3, 2013) pushed the average call money rate further down to 7.29 per cent during May 2013. During June 2013, the call rate declined further to 7.24 per cent, reflecting an improvement in the liquidity conditions (Chart V.6). V.10 The rates in the collateralised segments (i.e., CBLO and market repo) moved in tandem with the call rate, but generally remained below it during Q1 of 2013-14. The collateralised segment continued to remain the predominant part of the overnight money market; its share increased to around 84 per cent during Q1 of 2013-14 from 81 per cent during Q4 of 2012-13. V.11 Given the lower demand for funds, the average gross fortnightly issuance of CDs amounted to `333 billion in 2012-13 compared with `384 billion during 2011-12. The average gross fortnightly issuance of CDs during Q1 of 2013-14 stood at `340 billion. Accordingly, the outstanding amount of CDs, which was `4,252 billion at end-June 2012, decreased to around `3,645 billion at end-June 2013. Given the reduction in banks\u2019 preference for bulk deposits, the weighted average effective interest rate (WAEIR) of CDs also declined to 8.19 per cent as on June 28, 2013 from 9.30 per cent as on June 29, 2012 (Table V.1). V.12 During 2012-13, the average fortnightly gross issuance of commercial papers (CPs) stood at around `319 billion as against the average gross issuance of `244 billion during V.13 The outstanding amount of CPs issued by corporates, which was around `1,258 billion as of end-June 2012, increased to around `1,356 billion as of end-June 2013. The weighted average discount rate (WADR) in respect of aggregate CP issuances decreased to 8.54 per cent at end-June 2013 from 10.10 per cent at end-June 2012. \u2018Leasing and Finance\u2019 and \u2018manufacturing companies\u2019 remained the major issuers of CPs. V.16 In response to the measures announced by the Reserve Bank on July 15, 2013, bond yields hardened further. The 10-year generic G-sec yields increased by over 50 basis points to close at 8.13 per cent on July 16, 2013. The measures taken by the Reserve Bank on July 23, 2013 led to further hardening of yields, with the 10-year generic yield standing at 8.46 per cent on July 24, 2013. However, the yields fell sharply on July 25, 2013. The 10-year yield declined by 23 basis points after the Reserve Banks\u2019 signals for higher short-term rates and as market perceived the Reserve Bank\u2019s action as working to bring stability to the rupee exchange rate. Yields harden following the Fed\u2019s response V.14 During the period April-May 2013, the G-sec yields softened, taking cues from (i) a lower reading of CPI and WPI numbers for March and April, (ii) softening of international commodity prices and (iii) the decision to reduce withholding tax on FII interest income on G-secs to 5 per cent from 20 per cent, although S&P\u2019s decision to re-affirm the negative rating outlook on India put some pressure on bond yields (Chart V.7). V.15 Yields started hardening towards end- May 2013 as part of the global bond sell-off that followed the Fed Chairman\u2019s response in May 2013 and subsequent forward guidance in June 2013. The 10-year generic yield hardened from 7.12 per cent on May 24, 2013 to 7.60 per cent by July 15, 2013 (Chart V.8). V.17 The average daily trading volume of central government securities in the secondary market increased to around `570 billion during Q1 of 2013-14 from `376 billion during Q4 of 2012-13. The traded volume in G-secs generally varied inversely with G-sec yields. V.18 The gross market borrowings of the central government through dated securities during 2013-14 were to the tune of `2,100 billion (net borrowings of `1,972 billion) up to July 26, 2013 compared with `2,340 billion (net borrowings of `1,594 billion) during the corresponding period of the previous year. The weighted average maturity of the dated securities increased to 14.96 years from 13.62 years during the corresponding period of the announced by the Reserve Bank in mid-July 2013. Domestic equity markets record marginal increase amid global uncertainties Central Government Gross amount raised (` billion) Devolvement on primary dealers (` billion) Bid-cover ratio (range) Weighted average maturity (years) Weighted average yield (per cent) State Government Gross amount raised (` billion) Cut-off yield range (Per cent) Weighted average yield (Per cent) previous year. The weighted average yield during the primary auctions eased to 7.64 per cent from 8.52 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year. The weighted average yield during the primary auctions eased to 7.64 per cent from 8.52 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year (Table V.2). The bid-cover ratio stood in the range of 1.41-6.09 as against 1.47-3.59 during the corresponding period of the previous year. The government availed of ways and means advances (WMA) on three occasions up to end- June 2013. As on July 16, 2013 the outstanding WMA position of the government was `3.06 billion. V.21 During the \ufb01 nancial year 2013-14 (up to July 26, 2013), the BSE Sensex and CNX Nifty recorded gains of 4.8 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively (Chart V.9). The stock market recorded signi\ufb01 cant gains at the beginning of the quarter due to sustained FII buying and easing of concerns about the twin de\ufb01 cits due to moderation in commodity prices. However, the market pared some of its earlier gains in June 2013 due mainly to worries over capital out\ufb02 ows arising from the signals of gradual tapering of monetary stimulus by the US Fed and weak industrial output data of the domestic economy. Other ancillary factors such as the weak growth outlook for China, the persistent weakness of the rupee vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar and net sales by FIIs reinforced the pressures. V.22 In response to the measures announced by the Reserve Bank on July 15, 2013, the BSE Sensex declined by over 180 points (0.9 per cent) on July 16, 2013. The BSE Bankex was among the worst hit, declining by nearly 5 per cent. Re\ufb02 ecting the impact of July 23 measures, the BSE Bankex declined by 590 points (4.6 per cent) on July 24, while the drop in the Sensex was over 200 points (1.04 per cent). V.19 During 2013-14 (up to July 16, 2013), 18 states have raised `401.2 billion on a gross basis (net amount of `252.3 billion) compared with `419.8 billion (net amount of `369.6 billion) raised by 20 states during the corresponding period of the previous year. The weighted average yield eased to 7.98 per cent up to July 16, 2013 from 9.01 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year. V.23 During Q1 of 2013-14, FIIs made net sales of `90 billion in the capital market (both V.20 The yields on auction of Treasury Bills showed a declining trend till the middle of the quarter ending June 2013, but started hardening subsequent to the Fed Chairman\u2019s response in May 2013. Yields on Treasury Bills went up signi\ufb01 cantly (by 352 bps and 291 bps for 91-day and 364-day treasury bills, respectively) subsequent to the liquidity tightening measures equity and debt) as against net investment of `19 billion during Q1 of 2012-13. In the equity market, FIIs made net investments of `153 billion in Q1 of 2013-14 as against net sales of `7 billion during Q1 of the previous year, while in the debt market, FIIs made net sales of `243 billion in Q1 of 2013-14 as against net investment of `25 billion in Q1 of the previous year (Table V.3). However, after the response of the US Fed Chairman on May 22, 2013, both debt and equity markets recorded net out\ufb02 ows amounting to `522 billion and `116 billion, respectively, between May 22 and July 24, 2013. V.24 Mutual funds, on the other hand, made net investments of `1,376 billion during Q1 2013-14 in the capital market (both equity and debt) compared with `1,383 billion during Q1 of the previous year. Mutual funds, however, made net sales of `52 billion in the equity market compared with net sales of `6 billion during Q1 of the previous year. But they remained net buyers in the debt market. V.25 Equity market volatility, measured by NSE\u2019s VIX index, which was subdued during a major part of 2012-13, witnessed a marginal Healthcare and FMCG continued to outperform the Sensex V.26 During Q1 of 2013-14, the BSE healthcare and FMCG sectors continued to outperform the benchmark BSE Sensex. Indices of these sectors recorded increase of 10 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, compared with an increase of 3 per cent in the BSE Sensex. However, a large segment of the market underperformed the benchmark index: realty, consumer durables, metals and IT were the worst performing indices. V.27 During April-May 2013, the total resource mobilisation from the primary equity market more than doubled to `9.3 billion compared with `3.9 billion mobilised during April-May 2012 (Table V.4). The higher resource mobilisation in equity was due to a recovery in the secondary market and the \ufb02 oatation of a mega issue in May 2013. Resource mobilisation via the private placement route continued its growth momentum. During April-May 2013, mobilisation through private placements increased by nearly 59 per cent to `756 billion as compared to `475 billion in the corresponding period last year. Led by private sector mutual funds, resources mobilised by mutual funds during April-June 2013 also registered an prices has increased by over 110 per cent (up to Q4:2012-13) (Table V.5). Risks to \ufb01 nancial conditions remain from spillovers and slowing growth V.29 Although the immediate risks to the euro area appear to have receded, the early signs of recovery in the US are posing fresh challenges for policymakers. As the evidence over the past couple of months suggests, the challenges of communicating an exit from unconventional monetary policy exist as such signals can lead to spillovers with consequences of heightened volatility and possibilities of markets overshooting. In turn, this poses newer challenges for policymaking in EMDEs. It, therefore, becomes important for EMDEs to ensure adequate buffers and hedges in order to manage such sharp and sudden risks. House prices remain at elevated levels V.28 The y-o-y growth in the Reserve Bank house price index was around 19 per cent in Q4 of 2012-13. The q-o-q increase remained moderate at 2.1 per cent. On a y-o-y basis, the increase has been the highest in Kolkata, whereas it witnessed a decline in Kanpur. During the past four years, the index of house V.30 While the slew of measures taken over the past several months on the domestic front provide comfort, the balance of risks still appears to be on the downside, with weaknesses in corporate and banks\u2019 balance sheets feeding into each other. Weaknesses in the macro- \ufb01 nancial environment are also adding to the pressures. The balance sheet effects from slowing growth can impact the evolving \ufb01 nancial market conditions. It is, therefore, important to continuously monitor these risks and take preventive policy actions to ride over this downside. Lower global commodity prices, a negative output gap and past monetary policy actions contributed to a decline in headline wholesale price index (WPI) in\ufb02 ation to below 5 per cent in Q1 of 2013-14. Non-food manufactured product in\ufb02 ation also came down sharply to its lowest level in the past three years. Food in\ufb02 ation increased again in May and June 2013, putting pressures on the general price level. It could moderate somewhat if the monsoon remains on track during the rest of the season. However, the recent currency depreciation and upward pressure on fuel prices due to geo-political uncertainties pose upside risks to in\ufb02 ation. Near double-digit consumer price in\ufb02 ation also remains a major concern. In\ufb02 ation remains moderate in advanced and some emerging economies VI.1 In\ufb02 ation pressures eased in advanced economies (AEs) and some emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) during Q2 of 2013. In most AEs, in\ufb02 ation remained at low levels due to subdued demand and a correction in energy prices. Consumer price in\ufb02 ation in OECD countries was 1.8 per cent in June 2013, lower than the average of 2.3 per cent during 2012. In view of the subdued recovery and benign in\ufb02 ationary pressures, central banks in AEs continued with an accommodative monetary policy stance to support recovery. The European Central Bank reduced the policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.50 per cent against the backdrop of contracting output, high unemployment rate and depreciation in exchange rate vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar (Table VI.1). Unlike AEs, mixed inflation trends VI.2 appeared from EMDEs. In China in\ufb02 ation edged up to 2.7 per cent in June 2013 from 2.1 per cent in May. Similar upward pressures were seen in the case of Russia and Brazil. Most of the EMDEs kept their policy rate on hold, with Brazil and Indonesia being notable exceptions, which raised the policy rate on inflation concerns. Some decline in commodity prices in the wake of the withdrawal of stimulus measures and uneven recovery in major regions of the world pose a downside risk. However, a signi\ufb01 cant upside risk is expected from the recent currency depreciation in several countries with respect to the US dollar as well as geo- political tensions that could lead to further pressure on energy prices. Global commodity prices eased in Q2 of 2013, but crude oil prices rebounded in recent weeks VI.3 The moderation in global commodity prices witnessed in Q1 of 2013 continued in Q2. The IMF commodity price index declined by about 2.0 per cent during the \ufb01 rst six months of the year (Chart VI.1). The moderation was driven by improved supply prospects in most commodities and weak demand conditions on account of growth slowdown, especially in EMDEs. Despite the benign trends, the pass- through of commodity price correction to domestic in\ufb02 ation was partly abated by the recent appreciation of the US dollar across different currencies. VI.4 Global crude oil prices generally trended down in Q2 of 2013 on account of weak demand, build-up of stocks and improvements in supply. After increasing to US$ 119 per barrel in early February 2013, the Brent crude oil spot price fell to a low of US$ 97 per barrel in mid- April and then recovered to an average of US$ 103 per barrel in May and June. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) had recently projected that the Brent crude oil spot price would average US$ 102 per barrel over the second half of 2013 conditional on the absence of disruptions to energy markets arising from the recent geo-political unrest. However, Brent oil prices rose to over US$ 108 in July 2013 as the escalating political crisis in Egypt increased fears that it could affect the rest of West Asia and disrupt world crude supplies. Cash Rate Overnight Rate Interest Rate on Main Re\ufb01 nancing Operations 0.50 (May. 08, 2013) Key Rate Uncollateralised Overnight Call Rate Base Rate Of\ufb01 cial Bank Rate Federal Funds Rate VI.5 Metal prices declined on concerns about the moderation in global demand, particularly from China. The FAO Food Price Index declined marginally in May and June, re\ufb02 ecting supply conditions in cereals, sugar and oil and fats. Going forward, the path of global commodity prices would largely depend on growth prospects in emerging and developing Asia, particularly China. Further, the recent global developments and overall macroeconomic conditions do not indicate any substantial rise in the oil and non-fuel segment of commodity prices, which is broadly in line with the baseline assumption for in\ufb02 ation forecast for 2013 across several central banks. However, commodity prices, especially oil prices, continue to remain vulnerable to short-term supply disturbances. Domestic headline in\ufb02 ation declines below 5 per cent VI.6 Headline in\ufb02 ation, as measured by year- on-year changes in the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), declined to 4.7 per cent (provisional) in May 2013 before edging up to 4.9 per cent in June 2013 on account of an uptick in food and fuel prices (Chart VI.2). Average inflation during Q1 of 2013-14 at 4.8 per cent remained signi\ufb01 cantly lower than the average in\ufb02 ation of 7.5 per cent during Q1 of 2012-13 and 7.4 per cent during the year 2012-13. The seasonally adjusted month-over-month (annualised) changes in the WPI (3-month moving average) (m-o-m saar), turned negative in the recent period, but returned to positive territory in June 2013, pointing to a turnaround in the momentum. declining sharply to 2.0 per cent (by June 2013) and reaching its lowest level in the past three years. This was partly facilitated by lower international commodity prices, leading to bene\ufb01 ts from lower imported in\ufb02 ation. The deceleration in growth to below the potential level also translated into weak demand conditions, contributing to moderation in in\ufb02 ation. Food prices increased in recent months, but good monsoon may contain price rise VI.7 On the whole, headline in\ufb02 ation exhibited a softening bias during Q1 of 2013-14, driven by all three major sub-groups, viz., primary articles, fuel and power and manufactured products (Chart VI.3). The major contribution, however, came from the non-food manufactured products group, with in\ufb02 ation in this segment VI.8 Food price in\ufb02 ation has been a major driver of headline inflation in recent years (Chart VI.4a). High input costs, rising wages and inelastic supply responses to demand led to higher food price inflation. The delayed monsoon with a skewed spatial distribution contributed to high food in\ufb02 ation during most part of 2012-13. Food articles inflation, however, receded sharply from 12.3 per cent in January 2013 to 6.1 per cent in April 2013 reflecting improved supply conditions and arrival of rabi crops. A surge in the prices of vegetables, cereals and \u2018eggs, meat and \ufb01 sh\u2019 led to a reversal of trend during May and June 2013 (Chart VI.4b). Going forward, the satisfactory progress of monsoon so far has boosted the prospects for improved foodgrain production for the current year. The increases in Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for kharif food crops for 2013-14 work out to an average of 4.1 per cent (using WPI weights). This is signi\ufb01 cantly lower than the average increase of 16.3 per cent during 2007-08 to 2012-13. The lower order increase in MSPs this year could also ease some of the pressures on food in\ufb02 ation, although several other structural impediments still continue to put pressure on food prices. Revisions in administered prices restrict the moderation in in\ufb02 ation at 4.1 per cent compared with the headline in\ufb02 ation of 4.9 per cent for June 2013. Given the increase in global crude oil prices and rupee depreciation in recent weeks, further increases in administered prices could become inevitable which could lead to higher in\ufb02 ation readings. Fuel in\ufb02 ation is driven by global oil prices and administered price revisions VI.10 The moderation in international oil prices during Q1 of 2013-14 led to some decline in the prices of freely priced fuel products. This was re\ufb02 ected in a decline in fuel in\ufb02 ation to a 40-month low of 7.1 per cent in June 2013. The revision in the administered prices of diesel in a staggered manner, however, partly offset the impact of lower oil prices. Even though the gap between administered and non-administered products under the mineral oils group declined in the recent period, it remains signi\ufb01 cant (Chart VI.6). The depreciation of the rupee as well as the \ufb01 rming up of global crude prices following the political uncertainties in the Middle East led to some increase in the prices of freely priced fuel products in June\u2013July 2013. VI.9 The revisions in administered prices, particularly of diesel and electricity, led to a pick-up in in\ufb02 ation for administered price items during April-May 2013 (Chart VI.5). These revisions re\ufb02 ect both lagged pass-through of past increases in global prices as well as increases in input costs. Given these adjustments in administered prices, the moderation in overall in\ufb02 ation remained constrained. In\ufb02 ation for the non-administered price group was much lower VI.11 During 2012-13, the total reported under- recoveries of the oil marketing companies (OMCs) was `1.61 trillion, of which 57 per cent was on account of diesel. Since September 2012, under-recoveries declined signi\ufb01 cantly, driven both by lower global crude prices and administered price revisions (Chart VI.7). During the initial months of 2013-14, falling which, domestic natural gas prices would be based on competitive international prices from April 2014. This could lead to increases in costs of production for gas-based power and fertiliser plants. The impact on in\ufb02 ation, however, could depend on how end-user prices are adjusted in line with increasing costs. Generalised in\ufb02 ationary pressures ease, as the output gap remains negative global crude prices and a relatively stable exchange rate led to a signi\ufb01 cant decline in the extent of under-recoveries. Since mid-May 2013, however, the depreciation in the exchange rate and the increase in global crude oil prices offset the moderating impact of staggered increases in domestic prices. The per-litre under-recovery for OMCs from the sale of subsidised diesel increased to `9.5 per litre effective July 16, 2013, from a low of `3.7 per litre during the second fortnight of May 2013. VI.12 Coal India has revised upwards the prices of coal from May 28, 2013, which could lead to an increase in input cost pressures for coal- consuming industries. Given the problems in the coal sector in terms of availability of coal, the government approved the proposal to set up an independent regulatory authority for the coal sector and also approved the introduction of the Coal Regulatory Authority Bill, 2013 in Parliament. This is expected to remove constraints in the sector and ensure improved supply and better clarity in pricing. VI.14 The non-food manufactured products (NFMP) in\ufb02 ation, which is seen as an indicator of generalised in\ufb02 ationary pressures, declined signi\ufb01 cantly in recent months to reach 2.0 per cent by June 2013, largely driven by a decline in in\ufb02 ation in the metals and chemicals groups (Chart VI.8). Global metal prices have declined signi\ufb01 cantly in recent months, leading to a decline in domestic prices, even after accounting for the impact of rupee depreciation. VI.15 Along with declining input cost pressures, demand conditions also remained weak, leading to lower pricing power of the \ufb01 rms. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturing indicates that both input costs and output price pressures had ebbed in recent months (Chart VI.9). The PMI for output price declined to below 50 in May 2013, indicating a contraction in output prices. However, the PMI for input price exhibited a sharp turnaround in June 2013, reflecting the impact of rupee depreciation. VI.13 Several State Electricity Boards (SEBs) revised their prices upwards in May 2013, which led to a 13 per cent increase in the electricity price index in the WPI. Further increases in electricity prices cannot be ruled out, as the increase in coal prices could lead to input price pressures. Further, the government has approved the recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee on natural gas pricing, according to on a number of factors including how administered prices are adjusted in line with changes in rupee cost of imports and the pricing power of \ufb01 rms. Real wage growth moderates in the recent period, driven by higher in\ufb02 ation in rural areas Pass-through of exchange rate depreciation could offset bene\ufb01 ts from falling commodity prices VI.17 Rural wages, which were growing at over 20 per cent (y-o-y) during 2010-12, grew at a slower pace during 2012-13, but still remain in the high double digits. A signi\ufb01 cant pick-up in rural in\ufb02 ation in recent months contributed to a faster decline in real wage growth (Chart VI.11). There is, however, signi\ufb01 cant variation in wages and in\ufb02 ation across states (Chart VI.12). VI.16 Global commodity prices have exhibited negative in\ufb02 ation since March 2012. The impact of this on domestic in\ufb02 ation, however, remained muted, as the exchange rate depreciation acted as an offsetting factor (Chart VI.10). In the case of crude oil, the recent \ufb01 rming of global prices along with rupee depreciation pass-through could lead to higher domestic fuel prices. In terms of empirical estimates, while the pass- through of rupee depreciation has come down over period, the impact of the recent depreciation of the rupee on WPI in\ufb02 ation could still be signi\ufb01 cant. Recent estimates indicate that a 10 per cent depreciation could lead to about 1.0 percentage point increase in the WPI in\ufb02 ation. However, the exact impact could be conditional Divergence between WPI and CPI in\ufb02 ation remains wide VI.18 The Consumer Price Index (CPI- combined: rural + urban) in\ufb02 ation remained close to double digits compared with WPI in\ufb02 ation, which fell below 5 per cent during Q1 of 2013-14 (Chart VI.13). This further widened the gap between WPI and CPI in\ufb02 ation. From the compilation point of view, the CPI and the WPI differ on several counts, such as coverage of commodity/service, weighting diagram, the stage at which price quotations are collected, associated market (i.e., wholesale market, retail market) and base year. VI.19 The difference between wholesale and retail price levels can largely be attributed to trade divergence in price movements at the commodity group levels. Food price in\ufb02 ation in the WPI moderated at a faster rate than in CPI during February-April 2013 (Chart VI.14). The sharper moderation in the WPI food in\ufb02 ation was due to a decline in in\ufb02 ation of fruits and vegetables along with some softening in the in\ufb02 ation of cereals and pulses, except in May and June 2013. In the CPI, in\ufb02 ation in cereals and pulses remained high, with some moderation in in\ufb02 ation in vegetables and fruits during the same period. Headline in\ufb02 ation has moderated, but upside risks persist and transports margins and taxes across states. In the case of market integration the price pressures should reflect identically in the wholesale and retail markets as movements in wholesale prices should translate to the retail market with some lag. However, supply-demand gap at the regional level, could lead to greater pressures on retail prices than in the wholesale market. This requires improving the current state of supply chain management to provide better market access to farmers, storage facilities and transportation. Divergence in wholesale and retail in\ufb02 ation remains high in some food items VI.20 Apart from the divergence attributed to weights and commodities, there has been a VI.21 The moderation in headline in\ufb02 ation during Q1 of 2013-14 was on account of declining international commodity prices, negative output gap and past monetary policy actions. The pick-up in headline WPI and CPI in\ufb02 ation in June 2013 suggest that in\ufb02 ation remains a concern even as the non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation has recorded a sharp decline to a low of 2.0 per cent. Moreover, CPI in\ufb02 ation rules close to double digit. While slow growth is likely to keep demand conditions largely subdued, risks persist from the recent exchange rate depreciation and the pick-up in global commodity prices, especially of crude oil. These risks underscore the need for continuous vigil and monitoring on the in\ufb02 ation front. Going forward, macroeconomic outcomes crucially hinge on evolving macro-\ufb01 nancial conditions and domestic policy response. These conditions worsened during Q1 of 2013-14 as \ufb01 nancial volatilities, which were set off from signals that the global interest rate cycle may start to turn, disrupted capital in\ufb02 ows to the EMDEs. If these trends amplify, there may be a risk to both growth recovery and in\ufb02 ation moderation. Business con\ufb01 dence remains low, as is evident from recent expectations surveys. Growth is expected to pick only slowly as the year progresses. While headline in\ufb02 ation has moderated, high consumer price in\ufb02 ation remains a concern. While recent measures to address exchange rate volatility have provided a temporary breather, it is important that structural reforms are pushed through to support growth revival and reduce CAD. Recovery may take time, although growth is expected to improve as the year progresses VII.1 After two years of deceleration, growth appears to be stabilising. Growth in Q4 of 2012-13 was broadly the same as in the previous quarter. Early indications for Q1 of 2013-14 suggest that the recovery is yet to shape in the economy. IIP growth stagnated during April- May 2013 recording a growth of 0.1 per cent. The contraction in May has been large on a seasonally adjusted basis. However, there are emerging signs that the downturn could be getting contained. Agricultural prospects for 2013-14 are encouraging given the good monsoon so far. Revival in mining and manufacturing will take some more time but some improvement is likely later in the year. The robust rural demand on the back of a good monsoon is likely to render some support. Meanwhile, the deceleration in services sector activity has added to the growth worries and lead indicators for the services sector suggest that services activity remains weak. VII.2 The well-distributed rainfall so far, that has been excess or normal in all regions except Haryana, east and north east, raises the prospects of improved agricultural growth and a pick-up in demand for consumer goods. The increase in the water storage levels in the reservoirs would also enable the hydro-power sector to enhance their capacity utilisation and contribute to improved electricity output. However, growth revival would require a pick-up in a range of services activities that fall under construction and \u2018trade, hotels, transport and communications\u2019. Overall, revival will not materialise until stable policy and regulatory regimes supportive of industrial activity are \ufb01 rmly in place and the envisaged plans to remove structural bottlenecks are quickly and fully implemented. Sustainable recovery requires control over consumer price in\ufb02 ation VII.3 India\u2019s consumer price in\ufb02 ation has been hovering around the double digits for 15 consecutive months. Such high in\ufb02 ation is a source of internal and external disequilibrium. It causes real consumption demand to fall along with lowering of household savings that provide the bulk of \ufb01 nancial surpluses to support private and public investments. High consumer price in\ufb02 ation does not help public \ufb01 nances either as it puts pressure for larger \ufb01 scal subsidies. As domestic savings get eroded, it widens the external gap re\ufb02 ected in the CAD. High in\ufb02 ation also means large in\ufb02 ation differential vis-\u00e0-vis global trading partners which then makes the economy vulnerable to currency pressures. India\u2019s current macroeconomic deterioration to a large extent, re\ufb02 ects the three years of high in\ufb02 ation, which is well above the threshold at which it turns detrimental to growth. While the fall in headline WPI in\ufb02 ation affords some comfort, it is important to bring consumer price in\ufb02 ation under control. VII.4 Going forward, in\ufb02 ation risks remain. The recent rupee depreciation of about 9 per cent in Q1 of 2013-14 is likely to put some fresh pressure on domestic in\ufb02 ation as pass-through occurs. Fuel under-recoveries have risen sharply due to the exchange rate depreciation and domestic price rigidities. Given the wide CAD, it is important to keep fiscal deficits under check. Therefore, it is necessary to pass on increases and adjust administered prices in the energy sector, including coal and electricity. However, in the short-run it poses challenges for in\ufb02 ation management. Surveys show business confidence continues to weaken VII.5 Recent surveys on business expectations show that business con\ufb01 dence has weakened further. There has been moderation on a y-o-y and q-o-q basis in the key indices that capture business prospects (Table VII.1). According to the FICCI survey, stiff global economic outlook, weak demand and the cost of credit continue to be concerns. The Dunn and Bradstreet Business Confidence Index declined by 7.8 per cent compared to the previous quarter due to uncertainty in economic outlook, both external and domestic, and constrained pricing power due to weak demand. According to CII, economic and political instability, high levels of corruption and infrastructure and institutional shortages are the three top concerns of \ufb01 rms. The latest NCAER survey shows some improvement on a q-o-q basis, but a decline on a y-o-y basis. While the seasonally adjusted HSBC Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing improved marginally during June 2013, the PMI for services declined although it remained in expansionary mode. The input and output price indices for both the sectors increased. Business expectations remain weak VII.6 The 62nd Round of the Industrial Outlook Survey (http://www.rbi.org.in/IOS62) conducted during Q1 of 2013-14 showed a weakening of business sentiments with the Business Expectations Index (BEI) for Q1 of 2013-14 touching the lowest level in the past three financial years. However, the index showed improvement for Q2 of 2012-13 (Chart VII.1). VII.7 An analysis of the net responses among various components of demand conditions shows that sentiments on production, order books, capacity utilisation and exports dropped substantially, whereas the sentiments on imports remained broadly unchanged. However, their outlook for Q2 of 2013-14 shows slightly improved optimism. VII.8 The results also pointed to deterioration in the overall \ufb01 nancial situation which dropped for Q1 of 2013-14 but showed improved # to be released. of 2013-14. The perception on pro\ufb01 t margins continued to remain in negative terrain, but showed some improvement for Q2 of 2013-14 (Table VII.2). Consumer con\ufb01 dence on current situation remains weak, although optimism about the future improves optimism for Q2 of 2013-14. Although the cost of external \ufb01 nance is perceived to rise, the percentage of respondents expecting this rise has been declining since Q4 of 2011-12. Sentiments remained broadly unchanged for availability of \ufb01 nance. While the cost of raw material is expected to rise, there is a marginal drop in sentiments for rise in selling price in Q2 VII.9 The 13th Round of the Consumer Confidence Survey (http://www.rbi.org.in/ CCS13) conducted by the Reserve Bank in June 2013 indicated subdued consumer con\ufb01 dence with the Current Situations Index (CSI) remaining at the same level as in the previous quarter. However, Future Expectations Index (FEI) indicates some improvement in consumer confidence, with an increase in positive perceptions on income and employment (Chart VII.2). The CSI and FEI have been estimated based on current and future perceptions of economic conditions, household 1 Net response is the percentage difference between the optimistic (positive) and pessimistic (negative) responses; responses indicating status quo (no change) are not reckoned. Higher \u2018net response\u2019 indicates higher level of optimism and vice versa. *: These questions are newly added by splitting the questions on availability of \ufb01 nance (both internal and external sources) in the 61st Round (Jan-Mar 2013). E: Responses for Expectation quarter A: Responses for Assessment quarter External agencies revise India\u2019s growth projections downwards VII.10 Most external agencies have revised India\u2019s growth projections downwards. These include the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The external agencies\u2019 growth projections range between 5.3 and 6.7 per cent (Table VII.3). Survey of Professional Forecasters indicates expectations of higher growth during 2013-141 VII.12 The latest round of the Inflation Expectations Survey of Households (IESH Round 32) (http://www.rbi.org.in/IESH32), conducted across 5,000 households in 16 cities and 7 occupational classes during June 2013, indicates that the three-month ahead and one- year ahead median in\ufb02 ation expectations remain at similar levels as in the previous quarter (Chart VII.3). However, the proportion of respondents expecting a price increase \u2018more than current rate\u2019 in the one-year ahead period has diminished for all product groups (food products, non-food products, household durables, housing and cost of services). In the case of the three-month ahead period, those proportions have marginally diminished for food products and cost of services. VII.11 The Reserve Bank\u2019s 24th Round of the Survey of Professional Forecasters outside the Reserve Bank (http://www.rbi.org.in/ SPF24) expects recovery in growth from 5.0 per cent during 2012-13 to 5.7 per cent during 2013-14. Growth is expected to rise further to 6.5 per cent in 2014-15. Average WPI in\ufb02 ation is expected to moderate to 5.3 per cent during 2013-14. The twin de\ufb01 cits are also expected to improve during 2013-14 (Table VII.4). Amplifying macro-\ufb01 nancial risks warrant a cautious monetary policy stance VII.13 Although headline in\ufb02 ation has receded in Q1 of 2013-14 and the CAD has moderated during Q4 of 2012-13, macro-\ufb01 nancial risks increased distinctly during Q1 of 2013-14. Faced with exchange market pressures, the Reserve Bank responded in July 2013 with 1 The forecasts re\ufb02 ect the views of professional forecasters and not of the Reserve Bank.

The immediate reaction of the measures has been rupee positive. Fourth, global trade deceleration may get extended if global growth slows again. Fifth, if domestic growth continues to decelerate, it could have a spiraling effect on the fiscal de\ufb01 cit, as revenues will fall. This could pose VII.14 However, macro-\ufb01 nancial risks could still amplify further under a number of possible developments. First, \ufb01 nancial market conditions could tighten further with, or in anticipation of, partial withdrawal of monetary stimulus in AEs. This, in turn, could trigger further portfolio shifts of capital from EMDEs to AEs and magnify the impact. Second, recovery in AEs could falter again with \ufb01 scal multipliers feeding through to slacken growth on the back of expenditure cuts and tax increases. Third, growth in key EMDEs, especially China, could slow further if rising in\ufb02 ation and \ufb01 nancial sector fragilities force monetary prudence. risk to macroeconomic and \ufb01 nancial stability, especially if wider \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit spills over to the current account gap. Sixth, \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit could widen if the exchange rate pass-through is constrained by holding back administered price revisions. Seventh, sustained high consumer price inflation could slow real demand and savings in the economy. Finally, political uncertainties could rise as part of the electoral cycle, which could affect the macroeconomy through different channels. VII.15 Macroeconomic conditions have distinctly weakened during Q1 of 2013-14. There is no evidence yet of recovery in growth even as headline inflation has moderated. C onsumer price inflation, especially food inflation, remains high, although a good monsoon should help in this regard. Business con\ufb01 dence remains low, as is evident from recent expectations surveys. The external sector is under stress. While recent liquidity tightening measures instituted by the Reserve Bank to curb volatility in the exchange rate provide at best some breathing time, it is important to push through structural reforms necessary to inspire the trust and con\ufb01 dence of both domestic and foreign investors. The priority for monetary policy now is to restore stability in the currency market so that macro-financial conditions remain supportive of growth. This strategy will succeed only if reinforced by structural reforms to reduce the CAD and step up savings and investment.

On the domestic front, the 2. foreign exchange market came under severe stress starting late May, prompting the Reserve Bank to initiate liquidity tightening measures to contain the volatility. As regards economic activity, risks to growth have increased notwithstanding the robust onset and spread of the monsoon.

Domestic economic activity weakened in Q1 of 2013-14. Lead indicators point to continuing headwinds facing manufacturing and services sector activity. Industrial production remained 10. muted at 0.1 per cent during April-May; in May, there was an absolute decline of 1.6 per cent spread across all constituent sub-sectors, barring electricity generation. Capital goods production continues to contract, reflecting deteriorating investment conditions. Although the manufacturing PMI improved modestly in June, the pace of expansion was anaemic. With the decline in the services sector PMI in June, the composite PMI fell too, suggesting broad-based sluggishness in economic activity. Spurred by the timely arrival of 11. the monsoon and above long period average rainfall so far (17 per cent excess up to July 26, 2013), kharif sowing has been\tsignificantly\thigher\tthan\ta\tyear\tago,\t with total sown area at 74.8 million hectares as on July 26 as against 63.5 million hectares recorded by the same time last year. To date, all regions, except the east and the northeast, have received normal/excess rainfall. 12. The deceleration in new orders growth reported in the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS) indicates low activity levels in Q1. This is corroborated by the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey (IOS) which indicates that the overall business sentiment remained subdued in Q1 and may improve only marginally in Q2. Early results of corporate performance in\tQ1\tsuggest\tthat\tsales\tgrowth\tand\tprofit\t margins remained subdued. 13.

Retail\tinflation,\tas\tmeasured\tby\t the Consumer Price Index [(CPI) new series], had moderated somewhat during April-May, but it surged close to double digits in June, driven primarily by a sharp increase in food prices. 15. Among other indicators, urban households\u2019\tinflation\texpectations,\tas\tper\t the latest round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, remained at elevated levels in Q2. Rural wages, which had been rising at an annual average of 20 per cent for 28 months, moderated since January 2013. According to the Reserve Bank\u2019s quarterly house price index, increase in house prices also moderated in Q4 of 2012-13. 16. Money supply (M3), at 12.8 per cent y-o-y on July 12, was close to the indicative trajectory of 13.0 per cent. On the other hand, non-food credit growth at 14.3 per cent was lower than the indicative projection of 15.0 per cent, with the slowdown spread across all major sectors. The Reserve Bank\u2019s credit conditions survey shows that overall credit conditions are expected to remain broadly unchanged in Q2, though some tightening is expected in sectors such as construction, infrastructure, commercial real\testate\tand\tfinance. 17. The flow of resources to the commercial sector, from both bank and non-bank sources, at `2.6 trillion in 2013-14 so far (up to July 12), was higher than a year ago. While the contribution of domestic non-bank sources declined, there was an increase in resources raised from domestic banks and from abroad, especially through external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and foreign direct investment (FDI). 18. Liquidity conditions have eased considerably since the May Policy. The average daily net liquidity injection under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) declined to `828 billion during Q1 from `1,078 billion during Q4 of 2012-13. Government balances have been\tin\tdeficit\tsince\tJune\t28\tand\thave\t bolstered\tliquidity,\tthereby\tsignificantly\t reducing the demand for funds under the LAF. The net drawal from the LAF declined\tsignificantly\tduring\tthe\tfirst\t week of July. On July 26, it stood at `558 billion [including `229 billion from the marginal standing facility (MSF)]. Following the reduction in the 19. repo rate in May and easing of liquidity conditions, the modal term deposit rate of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) declined by 5 basis points (bps) during Q1. Although the modal base rate remained unchanged during the quarter, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on the outstanding rupee loans of SCBs declined by 6 bps during Q1. The WALR for fresh loans, particularly for housing and commercial vehicles sectors,\tdeclined\tsignificantly\tduring\tthis\t period. 20. During April-May, the Central Government\u2019s\tkey\tdeficit\tindicators\tas\ta\t proportion to the budget estimates were higher than a year ago, mainly on account of higher plan and capital expenditures, and decline in tax revenues by as much as 7.9 per cent. Up to July 25, 40.8 per cent of the net market borrowings of the Central Government was completed. 21. The CAD moderated to 3.6 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 2012-13, down from 6.5 per cent in Q3, due to a narrowing\tof\tthe\ttrade\tdeficit.\tHowever,\t for the year 2012-13 as a whole, the CAD was 4.8 per cent of GDP, well above the sustainable level of 2.5 per cent of GDP estimated by the Reserve Bank. 22. In the current year, the trade deficit\twidened\tduring\tQ1\tover\tits\tlevel\t a year ago, mainly on account of deteriorating export performance. Financing came by way of higher FDI, net ECBs and accretion to non-resident deposits, with some use of reserves. 23. Beginning late May, following some comments of the US Fed, apprehensions of likely tapering of QE in\tthe\tUS\ttriggered\toutflows\tof\tportfolio\t investment, particularly from the debt segment. Several measures were instituted to contain the ensuing exchange market volatility and to reverse unidirectional expectations. First, to curb import demand, import of gold on consignment basis was restricted on June 4 and customs duty was raised on June 5. Second, this was followed up on July 8 with further measures, including restricting banks to trade only on behalf of their clients in currency futures/ options markets, tightening of exposure norms, and raising margins on currency derivatives to check speculative activities. 24. On July 15, the Reserve Bank put in place additional measures to restore stability to the foreign exchange market. They included raising the MSF rate by 200 bps to 10.25 per cent, restricting the overall access by way of repos under the LAF to `750 billion and conducting open market sales of government securities of `25 billion on July 18, 2013. As a contingency measure and in anticipation of redemption pressures on mutual funds, the Reserve Bank opened a dedicated Special Repo window for a notified amount of `250 billion for liquidity support to mutual funds. 25. On July 22, the Reserve Bank rationalised import of gold by making it incumbent on all nominated banks/ entities\tto\tensure\tthat\tat\tleast\tone\tfifth\tof\t imported gold is exclusively made available for the purpose of exports. Any import of gold under any type of scheme will have to follow this 20/80 formula. Consequent to this, the earlier instructions banning the import of gold on consignment basis were withdrawn. 26. On July 23, the Reserve Bank modified the liquidity tightening measures by regulating access to LAF by way of repos at each individual bank level and restricting it to 0.5 per cent of the bank\u2019s own NDTL. This measure came into effect from July 24, 2013. The cash reserve ratio (CRR), which banks have to maintain on a fortnightly average basis subject to a daily minimum requirement\tof\t70\tper\tcent,\twas\tmodified\t to require banks to maintain a daily minimum of 99 per cent of the requirement. normal monsoon returning agricultural 27. In the May Policy, the Reserve Bank projected GDP growth for 2013-14 of 5.7 per cent, conditional upon a 5 27. In the May Policy, the Reserve Bank projected GDP growth for 2013-14 of 5.7 per cent, conditional upon a 5 growth to its trend level. The outlook for industrial activity, however, was in services and exports was expected to stay sluggish owing to global growth not improving\tsignificantly. 28. Activity, both domestic and global, has evolved in line with these expectations. While the onset of the monsoon and its spread have been robust, the persisting weakness in industrial activity has heightened the risks to growth. Moreover, global growth has been tepid, with some signs of loss of momentum in the US and in EDEs on top of the ongoing contraction in the euro area. This has impacted world trade with consequent adverse spillovers on India\u2019s exports, manufacturing and services. Over the last one year, the Government has taken several policy initiatives to improve the investment environment. As these initiatives work through the system and are further built upon, the current slowdown could be reversed, returning the economy to a higher growth trajectory. On the basis of the above considerations, the growth projection for 2013-14 is revised downwards from 5.7 per cent to 5.5 per cent (Chart 1). 29. In the May Policy, the Reserve Bank indicated that during 2013-14, WPI inflation will be range-bound around 5.5 per cent, with some edging down\tin\tthe\tfirst\thalf\tand\tsome\tincrease\t in the second half, mainly on base effects. During Q1 of 2013-14, the inflation\ttrajectory\thas\tmoved\tlargely\t in line with these expectations, although some\trisks\tto\tthe\tpath\tof\tinflation\thave\t surfaced in June.

Keeping in view the domestic demand-supply balance, the outlook for global commodity prices, and on the expectation that spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon during the rest of the season will be normal, the Reserve Bank will endeavour to condition\tthe\tevolution\tof\tinflation\tto\ta\t level of 5.0 per cent by March 2014, using all instruments at its command (Chart 2). 31. Admittedly, inflation during 2010-13 has been high and persistent. It is important to emphasise that notwithstanding this, during the 2000s as\ta\twhole,\tinflation\taveraged\taround\t 5.4 per cent in terms of the WPI and 5.8 per cent in terms of the CPI, down from its earlier trend rate of about 7.5 per cent for the WPI and about 9.0 per cent for the CPI. Given this record and the empirical evidence on the threshold level of\tinflation\tthat\tis\tconducive\tfor\tsustained growth, the objective is to contain headline\tWPI\tinflation\tat\taround\t5.0\tper\t cent in the short-term, and 3.0 per cent over the medium-term, consistent with India\u2019s broader integration into the global economy. 32. With nominal growth remaining broadly at the same level as envisaged in the May Policy, monetary aggregates are expected to move along the projected trajectories. Accordingly, M3 growth projection for 2013-14 has been retained at 13.0 per cent and aggregate deposit growth at 14.0 per cent. Non-food credit of SCBs is projected to grow at 15.0 per cent. As always, these numbers are indicative projections and not targets. Risk Factors 33. The macroeconomic outlook for 2013-14 is subject to a number of risks as indicated below. i. By far, the biggest risk to the macroeconomic outlook stems from the external sector. Financial markets around the world went into a\tflash\tturmoil\ton\tthe\tperception\tof\t an earlier than expected tapering of QE by the US Fed. The rupee depreciated in nominal terms by as much as 5.8 per cent between May 22\t(the\tday\tof\tthe\tfirst\t\u2018announcement effect\u2019) and July 26, consequent on sudden stop and reversal of capital flows\tin\treaction\tto\tthe\tprospective\t change in the US monetary policy stance.\tIt\tis\tnot\tclear\tif\tfinancial\t markets have factored in the full impact of the prospective tapering of QE or whether they will react to every future announcement of tapering. India, with its large CAD and\tdependence\ton\texternal\tflows\t for financing it, will remain vulnerable\tto\tthe\tconfidence\tand\t sentiment\tin\tthe\tglobal\tfinancial\t markets. ii. The large CAD, well above the sustainable level of 2.5 per cent of GDP for three years in a row, is a formidable structural risk factor. It has brought the external payments situation under increased stress, reflecting rising external indebtedness and the attendant burden of servicing of external liabilities. Most external vulnerability indicators have deteriorated, eroding the economy\u2019s resilience to shocks. The recent measures by the Reserve Bank to restore stability to the foreign exchange market should be used as a window of opportunity to put in place policies to bring the CAD down to sustainable levels. Furthermore, the growing vulnerability in the external sector reinforces the importance of iii. The investment climate remains weak and risk aversion continues to stall investment plans. The outlook for investment is inhibited by cost and time overruns, high leverage, deteriorating\tcash\tflows,\terosion\tof\t asset quality and muted credit confidence. iv. An environment of low and stable inflation and well-anchored inflation\texpectations\tis\tnecessary to sustain growth in the medium- term. To engender this benign growth-inflation\tenvironment,\tit\tis\t critical to ease the supply constraints in the economy, particularly in the food and infrastructure sectors. Without policy efforts to address the deterioration in productivity and competitiveness, the pressures from wage increases and upward revisions in administered prices could weaken growth even further and exacerbate inflation pressures. Through 2012-13, the Reserve 34. Bank persevered with efforts to address growth risks with a 100 bps reduction in the repo rate, supported by policies to ease credit and liquidity conditions through a 75 bps reduction in the CRR, 100 bps reduction in the SLR and OMO purchases of the order of `1.5 trillion. risks on account of the CAD could warrant a swift reversal of the policy stance. In its Mid-Quarter Review of June, the Reserve Bank paused its policy easing. This policy stance was informed by the need to await a durable receding\tof\tinflation\tand\tto\tbe\tprepared\t for the impact of growing uncertainty in\tglobal\tfinancial\tconditions. 35. In May this year, the Reserve Bank continued with its easing stance with a reduction in the policy repo rate by a further 25 bps to support growth in the face of gradual moderation of headline\tinflation.\tWith\tupside\trisks\tto\t inflation still significant in the near term, however, the Reserve Bank indicated that it saw little space for further policy easing and warned that 36. Keeping in view global and domestic macroeconomic conditions, outlook and risks, the policy stance in this review is guided by the need for continuous vigil and preparedness to pro-actively respond to risks to the economy from external developments, especially those stemming from global financial\tmarkets,\twhile\tmanaging\tthe trade-off posed by increased downside risks to growth and continuing risks to inflation\tand\tinflation\texpectations. 37. Against this backdrop, the stance of monetary policy is intended to:  address the risks to macroeconomic stability from external shocks;  continue to address the heightened risks to growth;  manage liquidity conditions to ensure\tadequate\tcredit\tflow\tto\tthe\t productive sectors of the economy. 38. On the basis of the current assessment and in line with the policy stance outlined in Section III, the Reserve Bank announces the following policy measures. 43. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks has been retained at 4.0 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). It has been decided to keep the 39. repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 7.25 per cent. The reverse repo rate under the 40. LAF, determined with a spread of 100 basis points below the repo rate, stands at 6.25 per cent. The MSF rate remains unchanged 41. at 300 basis points above the repo rate at 10.25 per cent. 44. The monetary policy stance over the last two years has predominantly been shaped by the growth-inflation dynamic even as external sector concerns have\thad\ta\tgrowing\tinfluence\ton\tpolicy\t calibration over the last one year. The current situation \u2013 moderating wholesale price\tinflation,\tprospects\tof\tsoftening\tof\t food\tinflation\tconsequent\ton\ta\trobust\t monsoon and decelerating growth \u2013 would have provided a reasonable case for continuing on the easing stance. However, India is currently caught in a classic \u2018impossible trinity\u2019 trilemma whereby we are having to forfeit some monetary policy discretion to address external sector concerns. The recent liquidity tightening measures by the 42. 10.25 per cent. Reserve Bank are aimed at checking undue volatility in the foreign exchange market and will be rolled back in a calibrated manner as stability is restored to the foreign exchange market, enabling monetary policy to revert to supporting growth\twith\tcontinuing\tvigil\ton\tinflation.\t\t It should be emphasised that the time available now should be used with alacrity to institute structural measures to bring the CAD down to sustainable levels. The Reserve Bank stands ready to use all available instruments and measures at its command to respond The next Mid-Quarter Review of 45. Monetary Policy for 2013-14 will be put out through a press release on Wednesday, September 18, 2013. 46. The Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2013-14 is scheduled on Tuesday, October 29, 2013.

The Reserve Bank further introduced 7-day and 14-day variable rate term repos to provide additional liquidity up to 0.25 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of banks. easing to support growth on the back of de\ufb02 ation or very low in\ufb02 ation, India has faced markedly higher in\ufb02 ation even when compared to its emerging market peers in recent years. This makes it important to keep liquidity under check and the policy rate at a reasonable level to anchor in\ufb02 ation expectations, with a view to ensuring stable macro-\ufb01 nancial conditions and positive real returns to savers. As the exceptional measures are rolled back with the improvement in exchange market conditions, it is important to keep this balance in view. Sluggish global growth continues to be a drag on the domestic economy Global growth continues to be sluggish, 4. as re\ufb02 ected in the downward revisions in projections by various international agencies. Notwithstanding a distinct improvement in growth in the advanced economies, as also some key emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), new risks to global recovery have arisen from \ufb01 scal discord in the US and uncertainties arising from expectations related to withdrawal from unconventional monetary easing by advanced economies. the pace of its bond purchases and its signal that the withdrawal of QE may take longer. However, \ufb01 nancial markets could be disrupted again when the extraordinary monetary accommodation in the advanced economies is withdrawn. momentum. Revival of investment demand will take some more time. Meanwhile, further measures are needed to avert \ufb01 scal slippage by reduction in revenue spending, especially poorly targeted subsidies. At the same time, public investments need to be boosted to crowd-in private investment with a view to supporting a revival in the economy. Moderate recovery expected during H2 on the back of a rebound in agriculture and an improvement in exports External sector risks lowered as CAD likely to moderate since Q2 facing Growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamics to shape monetary policy as normalisation of exceptional liquidity measures make headway substituted costlier money market sources by bank credit. As such, monetary and liquidity conditions are evolving broadly in sync with the policy. Further monetary policy actions would have to be recalibrated keeping in mind the growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamics, going forward. Near-term uncertainties remain a lingering concern Risks to in\ufb02 ation in H2 of 2013-14 broadly in balance, but persistence in CPI in\ufb02 ation remains a concern rate depreciation and rise in crude oil prices led to a rebound in fuel in\ufb02 ation. However, manufactured non-food in\ufb02 ation remained subdued. While food in\ufb02 ation pressures could recede somewhat on the back of a normal south-west monsoon, upside risks exist. These stem largely from second-round effects of high food and fuel in\ufb02 ation. This, to an extent, is already re\ufb02 ected in the stubborn non-food and non-fuel component of CPI in\ufb02 ation. Risks also arise from high wage growth and rising costs of transport, education and health services. Besides, structural elements and the ratchet effect may check the fall in food in\ufb02 ation arising from good harvest. A modest improvement in growth is 13. anticipated in H2 of 2013-14. Both WPI and CPI in\ufb02 ation may stay range-bound around the current levels that remain above comfort levels. Various surveys, including those by the Reserve Bank show that business con\ufb01 dence remains weak, while in\ufb02 ation expectations have risen again. In this milieu, monetary and \ufb01 scal policies will have to be crafted so as to allow structural policy measures and ground- level actions to shape a sustainable recovery by next year. The monetary policy will need to aim at anchoring in\ufb02 ation expectations, while appropriately addressing growth risks. Growth in India, like in many other EMDEs, has slowed for over two years. The slowdown in India was led by domestic structural constraints, while global cyclical conditions added to the drag. However, as some of the structural constraints are starting to get addressed, activity levels could improve in H2 of 2013-14 and a moderate-paced economic recovery could start taking shape towards the end of the year. Better crop prospects due to a good monsoon, initiatives by the government to speed up project implementation and a pick-up in exports, along with a reduction in external imbalances has set the stage for recovery but sustained ground-level action, especially in expediting project implementation is needed to achieve a sustainable turnaround. Global growth likely to remain sluggish in the near term I.1 Global growth appears to be on a sluggish trail despite an improvement in Q2 of 2013 . The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its World Economic Outlook in October 2013 revised global growth for 2013 downwards by 0.3 percentage points to 2.9 per cent. This downward revision is on account of slower growth in Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), including in China and India. EMDEs growth projections have been lowered by 0.5 percentage points to 4.5 per cent, while the projections for Advanced Economies (AEs) stays at 1.2 per cent. quarter-on-quarter growth rate, q-o-q saar), higher than 1.1 per cent in Q1 (Chart I.1a), due mainly to growth in exports and non-residential \ufb01 xed investments on the one hand and a smaller decrease in federal government spending on the other. But the US shutdown for sixteen days might get re\ufb02 ected in lower GDP growth in Q4 of 2013. The imminent risks to the global economy from a possible US debt default have been deferred with the US Government signing a debt deal on October 17, 2013. However, issues for the sustainability of the US recovery going forward remained with headwinds to investment, slack labour market conditions and a possible rise in mortgage rates. Although both advanced and emerging I.2 economies face the challenge of slower growth, there was a distinct improvement in growth in the major advanced economies during Q2 of 2013. In Q2 of 2013, the US GDP grew at 2.5 per cent (seasonally adjusted annualised I.3 Japan\u2019s economy expanded for the third straight quarter in Q2 of 2013 at 3.8 per cent. UK showed improvements for the second consecutive quarter in Q2 of 2013, growing by 2.7 per cent as against 1.5 per cent in Q1. The euro area grew by 1.1 per cent (q-o-q saar) in Table I.1: Slowdown in growth has been broad-based 2.1 Mining & quarrying the second quarter of 2013, helped by stronger growth in the two largest economies, Germany and France. Among the EMDEs, China\u2019s GDP in I.4 Q3 of 2013 went up by 9.1 per cent (q-o-q saar) as compared to 7.8 per cent in Q2 and 6.1 per cent in Q1. Brazil\u2019s GDP growth at 6.0 per cent (q-o-q saar) for Q2 of 2013 turned out to be better than expected (Chart I.1b). With the Fed tapering plans getting delayed, the EMDEs need to prepare themselves in the interim for the challenges that may arise. I.5 The US labour market conditions still remain weak with unemployment rate dropped to 7.2 per cent in September 2013, though additional non-farm payroll employment at 148,000 was also weak. UK labour markets witnessed unemployment rate of 7.7 per cent during June-August, down by 0.1 percentage points from March-May 2013. In case of Japan, the unemployment rate increased to 4.1 per cent in August 2013 from 3.8 per cent in July 2013. The unemployment rate in the euro area also remained high and unchanged at 12.0 per cent in August 2013. The Indian economy faced broad-based slowdown during Q1 of 2013-14 I.6 The slowdown facing the Indian economy extended into 2013-14 with growth in Q1 of 2013-14 falling to a 17- quarter low of 4.4 per cent (Table I.1). The growth slowdown was broad-based re\ufb02 ecting moderation in the services and agricultural sectors, and contraction in the industrial sector. Since H2 of 2011-12, the seasonally I.7 adjusted annualised q-o-q saar growth rate has moved in line with declining trends in the year- on-year (y-o-y) GDP growth rate, con\ufb01 rming the downward momentum in the real economy (Chart I.2). The output gap also continued to be negative (Chart I.3). Supply constraints, high inflation, cyclical factors and low external demand contributed to this slowdown. Agriculture growth expected to be buoyant Agricultural production during 2013-14 I.8 is expected to record an above-trend growth (Table I.2). The first advance estimates of production of foodgrains have placed kharif foodgrains at 129.3 million tonnes, a 10.3 per cent jump over the \ufb01 rst advance estimates of the previous year and 0.9 per cent growth over the fourth advance estimate. Oilseeds too are expected to show a substantial increase. I.9 A normal and evenly distributed south- west monsoon reinforced the possibility of a good crop. Rainfall during June-September 2013 was 6 per cent above normal. Thirty out of the 36 meteorological sub-divisions that constitute 86 per cent of the country\u2019s area received normal or excess rainfall. De\ufb01 ciency in rainfall was limited to areas in the East and North-East and in Haryana. Prospects for rabi crops are also good with water storage in the 85 major reservoirs as of October 17, 2013 being 16.3 per cent higher than last year\u2019s level. The Reserve Bank\u2019s production weighted rainfall index for foodgrains for the period stood at 102 per cent of the normal as compared to 87 per cent last year (Chart I.4). The same index for oilseeds (125), sugarcane (109) and cotton (126) was also higher. An improved kharif harvest is expected to help ease food price pressure. I.10 The current stock of rice and wheat at 53 million tonnes (mid-October 2013) is suf\ufb01 cient to meet buffer norms and requirements under the various poverty alleviation schemes (Chart I.5). These stocks can be utilised better in the short-run for price management keeping in view storage constraints that may emerge following another bumper crop. However, over the medium-term a reassessment of the food management strategy may be required keeping in view the expected higher off-take with the phased implementation of the National Food Security Act at the all-India level. Industrial activity continues to be constrained by supply bottlenecks I.11 The index of industrial production (IIP) for April-August 2013 grew marginally by 0.1 per cent. Contraction of the mining and manufacturing sectors has been the main factor in dampening the overall performance of industrial growth. Excluding capital goods and the mining sector, IIP grew by 0.5 per cent Table I.2: Initial estimates suggest jump in Kharif production Sowing 2013 (col 3/col 4) Production 2013-14 (col 5/col 6) Production 2013-14 (col 5/col 7) #: Million bales of 170 kgs each. ##: Million bales of 180 kgs each. -: Not Available. *: First Advance Estimates. @: Fourth Advance Estimates Source: Ministry of Agriculture, GoI. during the period (Chart I.6). Excluding volatile items such as \u2018cable, rubber insulated\u2019, \u2018atrazin\u2019, \u2018vitamins\u2019, \u2018food processing machinery\u2019, etc. truncated IIP (96 per cent of IIP) growth in April-August 2013 was negative at 0.9 per cent (Chart I.7). manufacturing sector during April-August 2013 was driven primarily by declining outputs of industries like machinery and equipments; accounting and computing machinery; basic metals; fabricated metal products; radio, TV, communication equipments; and motor vehicles. I.12 While the mining sector has been declining since 2011-12, the contraction in the The decline in the mining sector\u2019s output, particularly coal, affected thermal power generation which decelerated to 1.8 per cent during April-August 2013 from 8.6 per cent last year. However, hydro-electricity generation is expected to be distinctly better this year with the replenishment of water in reservoirs. Hydro- power has grown by 20.2 per cent y-o-y during April-August 2013. I.13 In terms of use-based industries, consumer durables and basic goods, which together have a 54 per cent weight in IIP, dragged its overall growth down (Table I.3). Core industries show some improvement over last two months I.14 Output of eight core industries improved consecutively for two months with a 3.7 per cent y-o-y growth in August 2013. The latest data Table I.3: Broad-based industrial slowdown led by contraction in consumer durables shows a pick-up in core industries\u2019 output led by steel, cement and electricity. However, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the growth of eight core industries decelerated to 2.3 per cent during April-August 2013 from 6.3 per cent in the corresponding period last year (Chart I.8). The deceleration in thermal electricity during April- August 2013 was re\ufb02 ected in a reduction in the all-India plant load factor (PLF) to 64.1 per cent from 69.8 per cent last year. I.15 Capacity utilisation (CU), as measured by the 22nd round of the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank, recorded seasonal decline in Q1 of 2013-14 over the previous quarter (http:// www.rbi.org.in/OBICUS22). There is a broad co-movement between CU and de-trended Index of Industrial Production (IIP) (Chart I.9). After a sequential increase in the previous two quarters, new orders declined in Q1 of 2013-14 both on a q-o-q sequential basis as well as on a y-o-y basis. Finished goods inventory to sales and raw material inventory to sales ratios increased in Q1 of 2013-14 and were higher than the previous year. Lead indicators portray a mixed picture on service sector growth I.16 The services sector grew at 6.2 per cent during Q1 of 2013-14 compared to 7.6 per cent during the same period last year. This was largely due to moderation in the growth of \u2018construction\u2019 and \u2018trade, hotels, restaurant, transport and communication\u2019 sectors. Developments in lead indicators of the services sector portray a mixed picture. Passenger and commercial vehicles sales and some segments of the aviation industry contracted even though indicators like tourist arrivals, railway freight revenue and steel production showed signs of improvement (Table I.4). The Reserve Bank\u2019s services sector composite indicator, which is based on growth in indicators of construction, trade and transport and finance, showed a Table I.4: Lead indicators point towards subdued services sector activity #: Data refers to April-August 2013; *: Data refers to April-July 2013. Source: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Ministry of Tourism, SIAM and CMIE Employment Scenario remains weak in Q1 of 2013-14 I.17 As per the Labour Bureau survey in eight key sectors, moderation in employment generation that started in 2012 continued in Q1 of 2013-14 (Chart I.11). The decline in employment generation was particularly sharp for the IT/BPO sector, re\ufb02 ecting the global slowdown and rising protectionism. Sector- wise, except textiles and leather, no other sector showed any perceptible improvement in employment generation during Q1 of 2013 on a sequential basis. Moderate recovery expected during H2 mainly backed by pick-up in agriculture and exports The Indian economy is expected to I.18 perform better during H2 of 2013-14 on the back Note: 1 Figures are absolute change in employment over the previous period. of a good monsoon which has boosted the kharif prospects. A good crop will have a positive impact on rural demand, which in turn may help in improving the subdued industrial and services sectors. Further, improved kharif harvest is also expected to help ease supply-side constraints and hence food price pressure. Exports have picked up with exchange rate adjustment though global growth remains slow. On the policy front, the government has started taking several policy initiatives in certain sectors, especially infrastructure, which are expected to improve the overall investment climate. However, these actions will take some time to translate into activity at the ground-level. Therefore, improvements in activity levels during H2 of 2013-14 are expected to stay modest though recovery could start shaping towards the end of the year if the current positive momentum is sustained. Notwithstanding a sharp rise in the government\u2019s \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure, aggregate demand in the economy remained weak during Q1 of 2013-14 because of deceleration in private consumption and contraction in \ufb01 xed investments. Persisting consumer price in\ufb02 ation impacted private consumption expenditure, while structural impediments and general uncertainty regarding the policy environment weighed down on investment activities. There was a sharp fall in fresh investment proposals from the private corporate sector during the quarter, re\ufb02 ecting the prevalence of overall negative business sentiments. However, a good monsoon this year and the pick-up in exports could boost aggregate demand. Private consumption weakened, fixed investment contracted in Q1 of 2013-14 II.1 Expenditure-side GDP continued to weaken during Q1 of 2013-14 mainly on account of a deceleration in private final consumption expenditure and a contraction in \ufb01 xed investments, even as the government\u2019s \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure showed a sharp increase (Table II.1). Table II.1: Aggregate demand continues to weaken mainly on account of deceleration in private consumption and contraction in \ufb01 xed investment II.2 Slowdown in income growth and persistence of a high consumer price in\ufb02 ation impacted private consumption expenditure while structural impediments and general uncertainty regarding the policy environment weighed down on investment activities. Investment in valuables, however, increased sharply on the back of high inflation and expected relative returns. In fact, among all the components of aggregate demand, the contribution of valuables to overall growth was the highest during Q1 of 2013-14 (Table II.2). At the same time, while exports continued to contract for the third successive quarter, imports also slackened in line with overall domestic activity and consequently, net exports posted a smaller contraction in Q1 of 2013-14 vis-a-vis previous quarters. Persistent efforts to address infrastructure bottlenecks will help turnaround investment demand, boost market con\ufb01 dence II.3 Persistent policy logjams, particularly those associated with delayed clearances on the part of the government; aggressive bidding on the part of private developers during the high growth phase; and inadequate appraisal mechanisms on the part of \ufb01 nanciers, brought the infrastructure sector to a standstill. Consequently project delays have been slowing India\u2019s growth in a big way. As of June 2013, about 50 per cent of central sector projects (of `1.5 billion and above) were delayed, up from 44 per cent in June 2008, for which the cost overruns rose from 12 to 20 per cent during the last \ufb01 ve-year period. Delayed projects were high in sectors, such as roads, followed by power, petroleum and railway. Table II.2: Valuables and government consumption supported overall growth Contribution-weighted growth rates of expenditure-side GDP (2004-05 Prices)* II.4 Furthermore, leverage of the firms operating in infrastructure sector for a sample of 50 BSE 500 companies has risen over the years. Total borrowing to equity has increased from 111.3 per cent in 2009-10 to 217.2 per cent in 2012-13. Raising fresh equity in this sector has been dif\ufb01 cult of late. II.5 However, efforts at addressing the problems have begun to unlock the potential in this area. The Cabinet Committee on Investments (CII) was constituted to expedite the clearance of projects; CCI has cleared about 209 projects till mid-September 2013. A Project Monitoring Group was also set up in the Prime Minister\u2019s Of\ufb01 ce which has \ufb01 nalised deadlines for the intermediate steps to be taken to accelerate key mega infrastructure projects. While the impact is not immediately seen, concerted efforts over the next six months could bring about a turnaround in investment demand. II.6 Amongst the infrastructure industry, the power sector was crippled by the poor performance of thermal power, with the plant load factor (PLF) declining continuously to almost early 2000 levels (Chart II.1). Estimates suggest that loss of power generation due to shortage of coal and gas amounted to around 50 billion units (BU) in 2012-13 and about 11.4 again in the next 1-2 years once the measures adopted by the government fructify and as investors\u2019 risk appetite improves. II.8 In the telecommunications sector, balance sheets of major private service providers have been under pressure for quite some time, with operating margins having shrunk. In order to revive the sector, the government took some measures including announcing the National Telecom Policy 2012 and increasing the FDI cap in the sector from 74 to 100 per cent. While Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) made various recommendations, spectrum pricing remains a vexed issue. BU during the \ufb01 rst four months of 2013-14. Though directives to sign fuel supply agreements (FSAs) have been given, the issue of demand- supply imbalance for coal is yet to be resolved. II.7 Activity in the roads sector was also at a low ebb, as projects awaited forest, environmental and land acquisition clearances. During April-June 2013, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) constructed/widened and strengthened 568 km of National Highways, recording a negative growth of around 7 per cent over the same period previous year. The government and the Reserve Bank have taken several steps to remove constraints facing the sector including delinking environment from forest clearances, treatment of lenders\u2019 debt exposure as secured loans, substitution policy for concessionaires and signi\ufb01 cant stepping up of efforts on NHAI\u2019s part to fast-track land acquisition. Over the last few months, the government has also been engaging with \ufb01 nancial institutions and other stakeholders to infuse greater funds in highway projects. However, with large number of tendered projects remaining uninitiated, cancellation of bids and re-biding need to be speedily undertaken. Besides, pushing engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) projects can partially offset the low interest in tendering for public-private partnership (PPP) based road projects. The PPP mode is expected to pick up Corporate investment intentions continued to moderate II.9 Corporate investment intentions remained subdued. The envisaged cost of projects for which institutional assistance was sanctioned during Q1 of 2013-14 aggregated `220 billion, which was signi\ufb01 cantly lower than the quarterly average for the previous two years (Table II.3). A sharp fall in fresh investment Table II.3: Institutionally assisted project investment witness decline Institutionally assisted projects and their envisaged expenditure (Quarter-wise)* Table: II.4: Corporate sales decelerate faster in Q1 of 2013-14 proposals in metal and metal products and power industries mainly contributed to this decline. An industry-wise analysis indicates that during Q1 of 2013-14, the share of envisaged expenditure on new projects was the highest in the power industry followed by the textile industry (Chart II.2). Sales growth decelerated, while net pro\ufb01 ts declined II.10 Sales growth (y-o-y) of non-government non-\ufb01 nancial listed companies continued to decelerate and reached a low of 2.5 per cent in Q1 of 2013-14 (Table II.4). The decline in sales was more distinct in the case of motor vehicles, medical precision and other scientific equipments, electrical machinery and apparatus, cement and cement products, iron and steel and real estate. The deceleration was most prominent for the manufacturing sector followed by the non-IT services sector. Sequentially, sales fell by 6.5 per cent in Q1 of 2013-14. While operating pro\ufb01 ts registered marginal growth, contraction in net pro\ufb01 ts was recorded for the second successive quarter. Further, pro\ufb01 tability in terms of the EBITDA margin improved marginally in Q1 as compared to the previous quarter. The net profit margin, however, recorded a marginal decline. II.11 Early results of 194 listed non- government non-\ufb01 nancial companies for Q2 of 2013-14 show y-o-y sales growth and operating pro\ufb01 ts have improved. #: For companies reporting this item explicitly. *: Other income excludes extraordinary income/expenditure if reported explicitly Note: Growth rates are percentage changes in the level for the period under reference over the corresponding period of the previous year for common set of companies. The central government\u2019s key deficit indicators widened; risks for \ufb01 scal slippage in 2013-14 II.12 The deficit indicators of the central government widened signi\ufb01 cantly during the \ufb01 rst \ufb01 ve months of 2013-14. Low growth of the centre\u2019s net tax revenue on the one hand and a signi\ufb01 cant increase in revenue expenditure on the other increased the revenue de\ufb01 cit of the central government, which has already reached 87.4 per cent of budget estimates. The widening of revenue de\ufb01 cit coupled with higher capital expenditure resulted in a gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit of 74.6 per cent of budget estimates during the 5-month period. This is the highest in the last \ufb01 ve years. II.13 During the current \ufb01 scal so far, gross tax revenue (as a per cent of budget estimates) has been lower than the previous year due to moderation under the major tax heads. Based on latest data for April-September 2013, gross direct tax revenue was higher by 10.7 per cent (5.9 per cent a year ago), with an improvement in both corporation as well personal income tax collections. However, net of refunds, growth in direct tax collections decelerated considerably during the same period to 10.7 per cent as compared to 16.3 per cent last year and 19.5 per cent budgeted for 2013-14. II.14 On the indirect taxes front, excise duty collections recorded a decline during April- August 2013, re\ufb02 ecting the impact of continued industrial slowdown (Chart II.3). The growth in services tax also witnessed deceleration in tandem with a moderation of India\u2019s services sector growth. However, collections from custom duties were higher than the previous year, re\ufb02 ecting the impact of rupee depreciation. II.15 There are also risks to budgetary targets arising from the slow pace of disinvestment this year. Proceeds from disinvestment programmes for 2013-14 were meagre at `14.3 billion as against `400 billion targeted in the budget. On the non-tax revenue side, the Reserve Bank\u2019s record surplus transfer of `330 billion in August 2013 has already contributed to nearly one-\ufb01 fth of the budgeted non-tax revenue of the central government. There is scope to offset the possible shortfall in disinvestment proceeds through payment of higher dividends by cash- rich public sector units (PSUs). Some of this cash can also be utilised by public sector units to boost public investments in their areas of operations depending on capacity creation needs and expected rate of returns. Restraining expenditure is necessary for \ufb01 scal consolidation II.16 The government\u2019s total expenditure during April-August 2013 as percentage of budget estimates was higher both in the revenue and capital accounts. Though, on the non-plan front, expenditure has been lower (Chart II.4), the spending on major subsidies during the period accounted for 62.3 per cent of budget estimates. Although the government has taken several steps to contain expenditure on subsidies through various reform measures, including phased deregulation of diesel prices and restrictions on subsidised LPG cylinders, the sharp depreciation of the rupee and increase in international prices of petroleum products increased the under-recoveries of the oil marketing companies (OMCs). OMCs reported under-recoveries of `256 billion in Q1 of 2013- 14 and are currently incurring a daily under- recovery of `4.42 billion per day. There is a need to raise diesel prices further given an under-recovery of `10.24 per litre (effective October 16, 2013); on current reckoning, given the spillover from the previous year\u2019s under- recovery compensation, fuel subsidies could signi\ufb01 cantly overshoot budgetary provisions. II.17 On the food subsidy front, although the recently enacted National Food Security (NFS) Act, 2013 may not lead to a breach in the budgetary provision of `100 billion for NFS, the overall food subsidy provision of `900 billion for the current year may not be adequate to meet the requirements of the existing targeted public distribution system. In subsequent years, implementation of the NFS Act could lead to increase the food subsidies depending on how it is rolled out and how other food-related schemes are merged with it. State \ufb01 nances are budgeted to improve in 2013-14, although \ufb01 scal concerns remain II.18 The consolidated \ufb01 scal position of state governments for 2013-14, based on their budget estimates, shows a continuance in fiscal consolidation, with an increase in revenue surplus and a reduction in the GFD-GDP ratio (Table II.5). Revenue surplus will be generated primarily through a reduction in the revenue expenditure-GDP ratio by 0.2 percentage points. On the expenditure side, although the capital outlay-GDP ratio is budgeted to marginally increase in 2013-14, the development expenditure-GDP ratio is budgeted to decline by 0.3 percentage points over the previous year, raising concerns about the quality of expenditure. Demand management requires balancing fiscal consolidation with investment support II.19 Containing the \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit in 2013-14 within the budgetary limit could be a challenge for the government, given the level of gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit during the current \ufb01 scal so far. The government has started putting some correctives, such as austerity measures including a mandatory 10 per cent cut in non-Plan expenditures excluding certain identi\ufb01 ed expenditures. The government has also been making efforts to improve tax compliance through a combination of administrative steps as well as incentives, such as the Service Tax Voluntary Compliance Encouragement Scheme. More such measures are needed to avert fiscal slippage. Fiscal multipliers for capital outlay are found to be significantly higher than that for revenue expenditure. Hence, \ufb01 scal consolidation with a re-orientation in expenditure from revenue expenditure to investment spending could be growth supportive as it will also crowd in private investment. Though the CAD widened again in Q1 of 2013-14, it is likely to moderate in Q2, broadly in line with the narrowing trade de\ufb01 cit. While re-pricing of risk and anticipated dollar liquidity shortage in view of the Fed\u2019s May 2013 statement on asset purchase tapering led to the depreciation of the rupee and capital out\ufb02 ows from India in line with other EMDEs, this trend reversed in early September following additional policy measures and improvements in global sentiments. Consequently, external sector risks have somewhat receded. However, the window of opportunity so created needs to be used to bring about further durable adjustment to lower CAD and encourage its \ufb01 nancing through long-term capital in\ufb02 ows, so as to impart greater resilience to large shocks. World trade prospects remain weak III.1 India\u2019s export performance over the last two years has been affected by continued sluggishness in global trade and an overvalued exchange rate for a prolonged period. Judging by the trends so far, global trade volumes in 2013 are expected to expand at roughly the same rate as last year, which was the slowest pace in the last 12 years, except for the contraction in 2009 in the wake of the global \ufb01 nancial crisis. A slowdown in growth in key emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) has further affected exports from these countries, which turned negative in Q2 of 2013 (Chart III.1a). However, there have been divergent trends in these countries in the recent period (Chart III.1b), including pick-up in India\u2019s exports in Q2 of 2013-14 (July-September). The depreciation in the exchange rate, both in nominal and real terms, appears to have helped improve India\u2019s export competitiveness in recent months. Trade de\ufb01 cit narrowed with pick-up in exports and fall in imports in Q2 of 2013-14 III.2 Amidst an adverse external environment, policy interventions helped India to reduce its trade de\ufb01 cit by about 38.7 per cent in Q2 of 2013-14 (y-o-y basis) (Chart III.2a). This was on account of both a sharp pick-up in exports and some moderation in imports. III.3 Export recoveries were evident in sectors, such as petroleum products, rice, readymade garments, marine products and other chemicals. Moderation in imports was largely led by a sharp decline in gold and silver import and a slowdown in imports of machinery, fertiliser, project goods, coal, vegetable oil and iron and steel. Subsequent to various measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank and the government to curb gold imports and a sharp depreciation in the rupee, gold imports declined by about 65 per cent in Q2 of 2013-14 (y-o-y) compared to an increase of 80.5 per cent in Q1 (Chart III.2b and Table III.1). During Q2, decline in value of gold imports was on account of both softening of international gold price and moderation in quantum of gold imports (by about 55 per cent). Accordingly, the merchandise trade de\ufb01 cit in Q2 of 2013-14 was significantly lower than that in the corresponding period in the previous year. Sustained improvements in the trade balance will, however, require a gradual recovery in trade partner economies and lower international prices of key import items (e.g. crude oil) as well as greater domestic production of commodities such as coal and iron ore.

CAD, though widened in Q1 is likely to moderate in Q2 India\u2019s current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD) III.4 widened from 3.6 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 2012-13 to 4.9 per cent of GDP in Q1 of 2013- 14 (Table III.2). With some visible improvement in the trade balance in Q2 of 2013-14, CAD is likely to show a signi\ufb01 cant correction in Q2. FII \ufb02 ows, which had turned negative since end-May 2013, reversed in September III.5 Notwithstanding a higher CAD in Q1 of 2013-14, capital inflows were broadly adequate to \ufb01 nance the current account gap, requiring only a marginal drawdown of foreign exchange reserves (Table III.3). While the net in\ufb02 ows under foreign direct investment (FDI) increased marginally, a signi\ufb01 cant rise was evident in NRI deposits over the previous quarter. Besides, there was a significant drawdown of assets held by banks under Nostro balances. Net foreign institutional investment (FII) \ufb02 ows remained buoyant in the \ufb01 rst two months of Q1. However, amid concerns about the gradual withdrawal of the quantitative easing (QE) programme, as indicated by the US Fed on May 22, 2013, there was re-pricing of risk and concomitant capital out\ufb02 ows from EMDEs, including India. Since then, there has been a net out\ufb02 ow of FII investments of US$ 16.6 billion up to September 6, 2013 before resumption of in\ufb02 ows in subsequent weeks. On average, there was a net FII out\ufb02 ow of US$ 2.2 billion in each month of Q2 (Table III.4). III.6 Recognising the risks to capital \ufb02 ows emanating from global \ufb01 nancial conditions, Table III.3: Net capital in\ufb02 ows almost entirely \ufb01 nanced CAD in Q1 of 2013-14 4.a Other equity (ADRs/GDRs) 4.b Currency and deposits Deposit-taking corporations, except the central bank: (NRI Deposits) 4.c Loans* Note: Total of subcomponents may not tally with aggregate due to rounding off.

Exchange rate pressures abate after a spell of sharp depreciation III.7 Amid heightened volatility in global and Indian currency markets, the Indian rupee depreciated speedily by 17.7 per cent against the US dollar during mid-May to end-August 2013. However, the rupee reversed the trend in September 2013 and appreciated by 6.0 per cent and further by 1.9 per cent up to October 25, 2013 as market sentiments improved on the back of various policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank and the government and the Fed\u2019s decision later in the month to maintain the pace of its QE. The opening of a forex swap window for the public sector oil marketing companies played an important role in stabilising rupee. Earlier, exchange rate pressures were evident in most EMDEs, particularly for current account de\ufb01 cit countries like India, where portfolio \ufb02 ows were severely affected due to the anticipation of a rollback of the bond purchase programme by the US Fed (Chart III.3). III.8 In terms of the real exchange rate, as on October 18, 2013, the 6-currency and 36-currency REER showed a depreciation of 13.0 and 9.8 per cent respectively, over March 2013 (Table III.5). Notwithstanding a decline in absolute III.9 terms, India\u2019s external debt as a ratio to GDP increased in Q1 of 2013-14. Decline in the level of external debt was mainly attributed to a fall in rupee denominated debt led by depreciation in the rupee and out\ufb02 ows from the debt segment of FIIs. While reserve adequacy indicators deteriorated further in Q1, India\u2019s reserves remained adequate to meet exigencies. India\u2019s net international investment position (IIP) as a ratio to GDP, improved from (-) 16.8 per cent at end-March 2013 to (-) 15.9 per cent at end- June 2013 (Tables III.6 and III.7). Table III.6: India\u2019s external debt reduced in Q1 of 2013-14 Table III.7: External sector vulnerability indicators showed a mixed trend PR: Partially Revised. QE: Quick Estimates. External risks somewhat declined, but need to build upon recent gains III.10 Since 2008-09, in the wake of the global financial crisis, India\u2019s external sector\u2019s weakness has come to the fore in several dimensions. First, CAD widened as a result of cyclical and structural factors. The CAD/GDP ratio averaged 3.4 per cent during the \ufb01 ve-year period 2008-09 to 2012-13 after having averaged just 0.6 per cent in the preceding 16 years after the 1991-92 balance of payment crisis. Second, there has been a surge in imports over the last nine years, as a result of which imports as a ratio of GDP almost doubled to 22.3 per cent from 11.8 per cent during the preceding 12-year period of 1992-93 to 2003- 04. The exports to GDP ratio also improved, but roughly at half the pace at which the imports increased. Improved foreign investment in\ufb02 ows helped \ufb01 nance the growing trade imbalance, but capital \ufb02 ow reversals post-Lehman crisis and again after the tapering indication this year exposed the growing imbalance making \ufb01 nancing of CAD dif\ufb01 cult. Consequently, the rupee came under pressure. III.11 In face of these pressures, the Reserve Bank and the government adopted a judicious approach that encompassed trade, monetary, \ufb01 scal and exchange rate policies to bring about a macroeconomic adjustment. Consequently, external sector risks have receded somewhat. However, uncertainties about future event shocks remain. It is, therefore, important to build on the recent gains by aiming at structural adjustments to further reduce CAD over the medium-term and encourage its financing through stable capital in\ufb02 ows. Monetary and liquidity conditions were tightened through exceptional liquidity measures in order to contain exchange market pressures and dampen volatility in the forex market. The MSF rate which was raised by 200 bps in July 2013, became the effective policy rate. With the ebbing of exchange market pressures, these measures are being rolled back in a calibrated manner. Notwithstanding the tightening, signi\ufb01 cant primary liquidity injection was done through LAF, MSF and OMO, besides increase in recourse to standing re-\ufb01 nance facilities. Money supply growth has been largely in line with the indicative trajectory. Credit growth has accelerated since mid-July, partly due to the substitution of costlier money market sources of \ufb01 nance by corporates with bank credit. Going forward, with the normalisation of exceptional monetary measures under way, incremental calibration will be shaped by changes in the growth-in\ufb02 ation balance, keeping macroeconomic stability in consideration. The Reserve Bank tightened liquidity during Q2 of 2013-14, raising rupee funding costs to curb forex volatility IV.1 Faced with a sharp depreciation of the rupee consequent on the sudden surge in capital outflows following indications of tapering of the US Fed\u2019s quantitative easing programme, the Reserve Bank hiked short- term interest rates and compressed domestic money market liquidity as a first line of defence. The measures taken included a 200 basis points (bps) hike in the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate to 10.25 per cent; a cap on daily LAF borrowing to 0.5 per cent of NDTL of respective banks as against the earlier practice of unlimited access against excess SLR holdings; and a hike in the minimum daily cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement to 99 per cent from 70 per cent of the requirement. Weekly auctions of cash management bills (CMBs) were also conducted to drain out the liquidity. These measures moved up the call rate to the MSF rate, making the latter the effective policy rate in line with policy intent (Chart IV.1a). IV.2 With tighter liquidity, the average daily liquidity injection under LAF (including MSF) increased from `526 billion in July 2013 to `1,131 billion in September 2013. The increase in government cash balances with the Reserve Bank and advance tax out\ufb02 ows also contributed towards the tightening of liquidity in September 2013. The liquidity tightening measures shifted the entire yield curve upwards with inversion visible at the short-end in line with the policy objective. It also led to a sizeable increase in corporate bond yields and commercial paper (CP) discount rates. In order to prevent liquidity conditions from becoming too tight, which would have excessively impacted financing conditions, the Reserve Bank undertook two OMO purchase auctions in August 2013 injecting primary liquidity of `125 billion (Chart IV.1b). Additional liquidity of `247 billion was also injected on a temporary basis by providing two-day funds to banks through the MSF on Saturday (September 14, 2013) to counter the effect of advance tax out\ufb02 ows. Exceptional liquidity measures being rolled back in a calibrated manner as exchange rate pressures ease IV.3 Taking into account the easing of the exchange rate pressures since September 2013 and evolving macroeconomic conditions, the Reserve Bank in its Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review (September 20, 2013) moved towards normalising monetary measures. In order to reduce the costs of funds, it reduced the MSF rate by 75 bps to 9.5 per cent. The minimum daily CRR balance maintained by the banks was reduced to 95 per cent of the requirement from 99 per cent to provide banks with the flexibility to better manage their liquidity situation. However, considering in\ufb02 ation risks, the repo rate was increased by 25 bps to 7.5 per cent. The Reserve Bank also signalled its intention to normalise the conduct and operations of monetary policy and to revert to the LAF repo rate as the operational policy interest rate. IV.4 As stable \ufb01 nancial market conditions persisted, the MSF rate was further lowered by 50 bps to 9.0 per cent with effect from October 7, 2013. In continuation of the Reserve Bank\u2019s assurance on adequate liquidity, an OMO purchase auction was conducted on October 7, 2013 injecting liquidity of around `100 billion. As an additional liquidity enhancing measure and for developing the term money market, the Reserve Bank introduced weekly variable rate term repos of 7-day and 14-day tenors for an amount equivalent to 0.25 per cent of the NDTL of the banking system. As a result, total access to funds from the Reserve Bank augmented to 1.25 per cent of NDTL (i.e., about ` 1 trillion) consisting of 0.5 per cent of NDTL under the overnight repo, about 0.5 per cent of NDTL under export credit re-\ufb01 nance (ECR) facility and 0.25 per cent of NDTL under term repo. The banks can also meet any further demand for liquidity through MSF. The \ufb01 rst round of 7-day term repo was conducted on October 11, 2013 (`190 billion) followed by 14-day term repo on October 18, 2013 (`195 billion). As a result of these measures, the liquidity situation eased in October 2013. Reserve money growth boosted by primary liquidity injection IV.5 Reserve money growth picked up in recent months to 8 per cent y-o-y as at mid- October, while the same adjusted for CRR changes was around 10 per cent. Liquidity injections through LAF, MSF and OMOs have aided the increase in Reserve Bank\u2019s net credit to the central government. Though net foreign assets (adjusted for revaluation) on the sources side registered a decline during the year, it was more than offset by the increase in the Reserve Bank\u2019s net credit to the centre (Chart IV.2). up in October re\ufb02 ecting festive demand (Chart IV.3a). On the sources side, bank credit to the commercial sector has picked-up since middle of Q2 (Table IV.1). Consequently, the wedge between the growth in bank credit and aggregate deposit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) widened to about 4 percentage points at the end of Q2 (Chart IV.3b). Broad money growth is in line with trajectory IV.6 Money supply growth hovered around 12.5 per cent y-o-y during H1 of 2012-13, broadly in line with the indicative trajectory of 13 per cent for 2013-14, and is currently at 13.2 per cent (October 4, 2013). Currency expansion that had been lower in H1 of 2013-14 has picked IV.7 Non-food credit growth increased from 14.0 per cent y-o-y on July 12, 2013 to 17.9 per cent on October 4, 2013, markedly higher than the indicative trajectory of 15 per cent. In part, this trend was supported by corporate \ufb01 rms substituting their market borrowings, especially Outstanding amount (` billion) 04-Oct-13 Note: 1. Data are provisional. Table IV.2: Banking sources dominate resource \ufb02 ow to the commercial sector through CPs, by bank borrowings (Table IV.2).

IV.8 Given the lacklustre domestic environment, banks need to ensure better credit management practices when extending loans, keeping a careful watch on their asset quality. The Reserve Bank\u2019s initiative to collate large common exposures across banks and make available the credit registry data is expected to help mitigate this problem. IV.9 Data on sector-wise deployment of gross non-food bank credit of select SCBs indicate a build-up in credit to industries, services and also personal loan category (especially, housing) (Chart IV.4a). Overall industrial credit growth (y-o-y) was at 17.6 per IV.10 With the Reserve Bank increasing the cost of borrowing under MSF, even while restricting the availability of accommodation under the LAF repo, the modal deposit rate increased by 20 bps (q-o-q) during Q2 (Table IV.3). This rise was mainly with respect to short- term maturities of up to 180 days re\ufb02 ecting the tightening of liquidity conditions. Although the modal base rate remained unchanged at 10.25 per cent during Q2, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on the outstanding bank loans increased marginally by 4 bps (q-o-q) to 12.15 per cent in August 2013. The WALR on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks increased sharply by 42 bps to 12.04 per cent in August 2013 from 11.62 per cent in June 2013. Normalisation of exceptional measures underway, changes ahead will be conditioned by high inflation and low growth challenges IV.11 The exceptional liquidity and monetary policy measures taken in the face of unprecedented exchange rate pressures were partially rolled back in the Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review on September 20 and further on October 7, 2013. Both these moves have lowered the effective policy rate by 125 bps. The Reserve Bank has also ensured suf\ufb01 cient liquidity in the system through LAF, MSF and OMO over a period of time in line with its assurances. Consequently, base money growth has picked up. Credit growth has also accelerated. With the process of normalisation of monetary measures making headway, monetary policy ahead would depend on how growth-in\ufb02 ation dynamics evolve. Liquidity conditions will have to be maintained at an appropriate level keeping in view the persistence in CPI inflation as also the slack growth conditions. Table IV.3: Deposit and lending rates of banks registered an increase in Q2 of 2013-14 #: Data on WALR pertain to August 2013. *: Based on loan outstanding as at end-quarter. Note: Data on WALR are provisional. The decision by US Fed in September 2013 to maintain its pace of bond purchases appears to have considerably calmed markets. Since then, EMDE equity markets and currencies have rallied. Pressures in bond markets have also slackened. Tracking these global developments and signi\ufb01 cant policy actions by the Government and the Reserve Bank, Indian stock markets turned around in September 2013 after the slump in the preceding two months. The Rupee also strengthened in response to improved trade \ufb02 ows and return of equity in\ufb02 ows. While markets have got a temporary breather, near-term uncertainties remain and steps need to be taken to build buffers to manage contingent risks. oil prices had further added to the selling pressures. V.1 Although the exact timing of a possible tapering by the Fed remains unclear at present, what is obvious is that market participants have been making adjustments to a new world of potentially less liquidity. In the aftermath of the Fed indication on May 22, equity, bond and currency markets across countries and especially in emerging markets had experienced signi\ufb01 cant losses. Unsettled geo-political environment in some Middle East countries which raised crude V.2 In the H1 of 2013 till mid-May, equities had experienced significant rally, aided, among others, by accommodative monetary policies by central banks of the advanced economies. US bonds also rallied in April 2013. However, the Fed\u2019s communication about exit from QE led to sharp fall in the prices of these risky assets for both advanced and emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) (Charts V.1). V.3 In the start of Q3 of 2013, global \ufb01 nancial markets witnessed volatility on the back of speculation over the timing of tapering off of QE by the Fed. In general, there was an out\ufb02 ow of capital from EMDEs, especially to the US. This reversal prompted a spike in the Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) spread to nearly 375 basis points (bps) by end-August from around 278 bps on the eve of the Fed tapering off statement; EMDE stocks declined and their currencies also depreciated. Country- speci\ufb01 c issues such as weaknesses in the current account, subdued export growth and infrastructural bottlenecks aggravated their concerns. V.4 The Fed\u2019s decision on September 18 to continue with the monthly quantum of asset purchase, stating that they will await more evidence of an enduring economic recovery before adjusting their pace, brought signi\ufb01 cant improvement in market sentiments. Equity markets in advanced economies and EMDE equity markets surged, government bond yields moderated and currencies appreciated against the US dollar. Although the signing of the \ufb01 scal deal on October 17 has avoided potential debt default by the US, concerns remain since the deal only funds the US government through January 15, 2014 and raises the debt ceiling through February 7, 2014. Further contentious debate over spending cuts and entitlement programmes seem likely to ensue over the next several months. In October so far (up to October 24, 2013), the equity markets in select EMDEs increased by 5.7 per cent on an average. Pressure on Rupee appears to be abating V.5 Subsequent to the Fed\u2019s \u2018announcement effect\u2019, downward pressure on the local currencies along with considerable volatility was discernible across major EMDEs. This permeated both countries with CAD as well as those with current account surpluses. Among the former, the volatility was particularly high in the case of South Africa, India and Brazil. After touching a historical low of 68.36 per dollar on August 28, 2013, the spate of policy initiatives enabled the Rupee to recover (as on October 24, 2013) by almost 10 per cent (Chart V.2). Currency derivatives activity subdued V.6 The impact of the regulatory measures announced by the Reserve Bank and SEBI against the backdrop of heightened exchange rate volatility, were manifest in the derivatives market wherein activity in the currency derivatives declined in Q2 of 2013-14 (Chart V.3). The situation in the money market was V.7 comfortable during the \ufb01 rst half of July 2013. However, the exceptional measures taken by the Reserve Bank during July and August 2013 impacted the money market. The weighted average call and CBLO rates increased to 9.97 per cent and 9.90 per cent, respectively, in September 2013 (Chart V.4). In continuation of its move towards calibrated withdrawal of the exceptional measures, the Reserve Bank on October 7, 2013 lowered the MSF rate by 50 bps to 9.0 per cent and announced additional liquidity measures in the form of term repos of 7-day and 14-day tenor for the amount equivalent to 0.25 per cent of banking system NDTL through variable rate auctions every Friday beginning October 11, 2013. As a result, the money market rates softened with the average call and CBLO rates standing at 8.92 per cent and 8.97 per cent, respectively on October 25, 2013. V.8 The measures by the Reserve Bank aimed at tightening liquidity appears to have impacted this segment, with the weighted average effective interest rate (WAEIR) of CDs increasing to 11.20 per cent on September 6, 2013 from 8.19 per cent as at end-June 2013 (Chart V.5). The average gross fortnightly issuance of CDs declined to `96 billion during Q2 of 2013-14 (up to September 6, 2013) from `340 billion during Q1 of 2013-14. The outstanding amount of CDs also declined to `3,011 billion as on September 6, 2013 from `3,645 billion at end-June 2013. V.9 With rise in discount rates, the appetite for CP issuance has fallen markedly and corporates are substituting funding through the September 30, and reduced the MSF rate by 50 bps to 9.0 per cent on October 7, 2013. The 10- year generic G-sec yield closed at 8.65 per cent on October 25, 2013. V.11 The average daily trading volume of central government securities remained low (Chart V.8). Despite rising yield environment, cost of borrowing for government falls instrument with alternative \ufb01 nancing sources, especially bank credit. The weighted average discount rate (WADR) of CPs increased to 11.53 per cent as on September 15, 2013 from 8.54 per cent at end-June 2013 (Chart V.6). G-secs yields moderate V.10 The \u2018announcement effect\u2019 on May 22, 2013 and subsequent measures by the Reserve Bank led to a signi\ufb01 cant hardening of G-sec yields. Generic yields on 10-year G-secs peaked to 9.27 per cent on August 19, 2013, after which it softened on announcement of OMO purchase auction on August 20, 2013. The yields hardened to 8.83 per cent on September 30, 2013 after a hike in the repo rate in the mid- quarter monetary policy review (Chart V.7). However, the markets rallied and yields softened after the Reserve Bank announced an OMO purchase auction of \u20b9100 billion on V.12 The gross market borrowings of the Central Government through dated securities during 2013-14 (up to October 21, 2013) stood at `3,890 billion (net borrowings of `3,143 billion) as compared with `4,090 billion (net borrowings of `3,234 billion) during the corresponding period of the previous year (Table V.1). The weighted average maturity of the dated securities improved to 14.40 years. The benchmark 10-year yield in the primary auctions eased during early 2013-14 touching a low of 7.16 per cent on May 21, 2013 and remained subdued. The yields increased signi\ufb01 cantly post July 15, 2013 due to liquidity tightness. Despite this, the weighted average cost of borrowing so far has remained much below that in the corresponding period of the previous year. However, the quantum of devolvement till October 24, 2013 increased to `163.76 billion as compared to `18.28 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. V.13 During 2013-14 (up to October 24, 2013), 24 states raised `970 billion on a gross basis (net amount of `654 billion) as compared Central Government Gross amount raised (` billion) Bid-cover ratio (Range) Weighted average maturity (years) Weighted average yield (per cent) State Governments Gross amount raised (` billion) Cut-off yield range (Per cent) 8.36-9.49 8.79 Weighted average yield (per cent) Nifty declined by 7 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, as FIIs disinvested US$ 13 billion in domestic markets during this period. However, the equity market recovered after the Reserve Bank announced a slew of measures on September 4, 2013. The positive feel-good impact of the Fed\u2019s September 18, 2013 announcements also boosted markets. The momentum continued in October as well with the BSE Sensex and Nifty gaining 11 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively till October 25, 2013 over September 4, 2013. Con\ufb01 dence also returned, with FIIs investing US$ 1.0 billion in equity and debt segments during September- October (upto October 24, 2013). Equity market volatility, measured by NSE\u2019s VIX index heightened during Q2 of 2013-14 (Chart V.9b). with `966 billion (net amount of `862 billion) raised by 25 states in the corresponding period of the previous year. In the corresponding period, the weighted average yield eased to 8.88 per cent up to October 24, 2013 from 8.93 per cent during the corresponding period last year. Equity market responds to measures and taper deferment to register gains V.14 During the \ufb01 nancial year 2013-14 (till October 25, 2013), the stock markets have gained 9.8 per cent (Sensex) and 8.1 per cent (Nifty). This movement, however, masks wide gyrations over the period (Chart V.9a). After initial gains, the announcement effect of May 22 put the global stock markets into a tail spin. Between May 22 - August 30, the Sensex and Primary capital market remained lacklustre V.15 During H1 of 2013-14, an amount of about `32 billion was raised from the primary equity market through 24 issues. Resource mobilisation via private placements declined sharply. Resources mobilised by mutual funds during H1 of 2013-14 also declined drastically, mainly on account of heavy redemptions recorded in debt-oriented funds, especially during June-July and September 2013. Resources mobilised through ADR/GDR also fell substantially (Table V.2). Turnover in the equity derivatives segment surges V.16 During April-August 2013, the turnover in equity derivative segment increased by Table V.2: Primary capital market mobilisation remained lacklustre Deputy Governor, Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty and the other under the Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Shri Arvind Mayaram, to look into various aspects relating to this crisis. These committees have since submitted their reports to the Central Government. House price increases abated in Q1 of 2013-14 V.20 The q-o-q growth in the Reserve Bank house price index (Base year:2010-11) at the all-India level was lower at 0.89 per cent in Q1 of 2013-14 (latest available quarter) as compared to 2.46 per cent in the previous quarter. The increase was the highest for Lucknow, followed by Ahmedabad and Kochi (Table V.3). 29.0 per cent to `206.7 trillion from `160.3 trillion in the corresponding period last year. Trading volume also increased by 15.3 per cent to 716.3 million contracts during April-August 2013 from 621.1 million contracts in April- August 2012. Crisis of NSEL exposes regulatory gaps prevailing in systemic institutions Table V.3: House price growth moderates, with city-speci\ufb01 c variations Y-o-Y (Q1 of 2013-14) V.17 Consequent to the directions of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs (MCA) to the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL), NSEL decided to suspend trading of all contracts, including e-contracts as well and settle all one day forward contracts under the supervision of the Forward Market Commission (FMC). V.18 This crisis in NSEL has raised the issue of inter-connectedness of \ufb01 nancial institutions. Many brokerage \ufb01 rms are active in multiple segments, including equity, commodity and forex. A loss in one segment of their operations can have a cascading effect on other segments, in turn, propagating contagion effects throughout the market. V.19 The Union Government has taken several policy initiatives to plug regulatory de\ufb01 ciencies. It has transferred the administrative control of FMC to the Ministry of Finance and constituted two committees, one under RBI #: Index is a weighted average of city indices, weights based Near-term uncertainties remain a lingering concern V.21 The Fed has decided to wait for more convincing evidence prior to initiating a graduated withdrawal of its bond buying programme. This has provided markets with much-needed breathing space. However, market uncertainties remain associated with how the debt ceiling issues will play out over the next several months and whether the incipient signs of recovery in the euro area sustain. Markets in India also face domestic uncertainties stemming from protracted slowdown, falling corporate earnings and rising leverage, besides risks of political uncertainties associated with the electoral cycle. On an average basis, headline WPI in\ufb02 ation has declined signi\ufb01 cantly over the past two years, though it has edged up since May 2013. Food articles in\ufb02 ation reached a three-year high largely due to a sharp rise in vegetable prices. Exchange rate depreciation and the rise in crude oil prices led to a rebound in fuel in\ufb02 ation to double-digit levels. As a result, headline in\ufb02 ation increased even though manufactured non-food in\ufb02 ation remained subdued. Going forward, the good monsoon should have a salutary effect on food in\ufb02 ation, but second-round effects from already high food and fuel in\ufb02 ation could impart upside pressures on prices of other commodities and services. Concerns about in\ufb02 ation emanate not just from high and persistent CPI in\ufb02 ation but also from rising WPI in\ufb02 ation. In\ufb02 ation and exchange market pressures prompted many EMDEs to tighten their monetary policies while in\ufb02 ation remained benign in Advanced Economies persisted with their exceptionally accommodative unconventional monetary policies (Table VI.1). Consumer price in\ufb02 ation in the OECD area was 1.7 per cent, year-on-year, in August 2013, down from the 2.0 per cent recorded in July.

Note: Figures in parentheses in Column (3) indicate the effective dates when the policy rates were last revised.

For India, data on in\ufb02 ation pertain to New CPI (Combined: rural + urban) the near-term given the current commodity price cycle and slack labour market conditions, normalising monetary policy in AEs may take a long time. VI.2 In contrast, monetary policy was tightened in many key Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), such as Brazil, India and Indonesia during Q3 of 2013 as they faced inflation and exchange rate pressures, amidst large and volatile capital out\ufb02 ows following the Fed\u2019s indication on May 22, 2013 that prompted expectations about the global interest rate cycle reversing. In\ufb02 ation risk for some EMDEs is likely to persist from exchange rate pass-through given that the pace and timing of withdrawal of monetary accommodation in AEs could keep capital \ufb02 ows volatile. Global commodity price in\ufb02 ation likely to stay subdued in the near term in EMDEs has led to some correction in global metal prices. With prospects of a strong recovery in global growth remaining dim in the near-term, the global commodity price in\ufb02 ation may stay subdued for now. Risks to global commodity prices, however, remain from volatile exchange rate movements and supply disruptions. Domestic WPI headline inflation rebounded driven by food and fuel segments VI.4 Headline in\ufb02 ation in India, measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in the wholesale price index (WPI), which had declined to a 42 month low of 4.6 per cent in May 2013 increased to 6.5 per cent (provisional) in September 2013 driven by a rebound in food and fuel prices (Chart VI.2). The average in\ufb02 ation during H1 of 2013-14 at 5.5 per cent, however, remained considerably lower than 7.7 per cent during the corresponding period of the previous year. VI.3 Global commodity price increases have been moderate for some time now though their levels continue to remain elevated in relation to the demand-supply balance. The IMF\u2019s primary commodity price index for Q3 of 2013 was 3.2 per cent higher than the level in Q2 (Chart V1.1). Prices, especially of crude oil have not declined commensurate with improved supply prospects, due to abundant global liquidity and geo-political uncertainties in the Middle-East region. At the same time, the growth deceleration VI.5 So far, the build-up of in\ufb02 ation during 2013-14 has been dominated by the food and fuel group which together contributed to about 87 per cent of the increase in the index during April-September 2013 (Chart VI.3). Vegetable price shock took food in\ufb02 ation to a three-year high VI.6 Food articles inflation was largely driven by signi\ufb01 cant increases in vegetable prices (Chart VI.4). Excluding vegetables, WPI in\ufb02 ation was at 4.7 per cent in September. High food in\ufb02 ation on account of a number of factors, including high input costs, rising wages and inelastic supply responses could have a destabilising impact on overall inflation expectations. Rupee depreciation pass-through and higher global crude prices pushed up fuel price in\ufb02 ation VI.7 Despite a signi\ufb01 cant increase in the prices of primary food articles, in\ufb02 ation in manufactured food products declined to a low of 1.6 per cent in September 2013. This could be attributed to negative in\ufb02 ation in sugar and edible oils which together account for about half of the weight in the manufactured food products group. For over a year now, there has been a signi\ufb01 cant decline in global prices for both these products (Chart VI.5). The decline has been signi\ufb01 cant enough to exert a downward pressure VI.8 Rupee depreciation and an increase in crude oil prices led to a rebound of fuel in\ufb02 ation to double-digit levels. Apart from the increase in prices of freely priced products, administered price revisions also contributed to an increase in fuel prices. However, the increase in administered prices did not keep pace with the rise in crude oil prices (in rupee terms) leading to greater suppressed in\ufb02 ation (Chart VI.6). The Indian basket\u2019s crude oil prices in rupee terms reached a record high of `7,263 per barrel during the \ufb01 rst fortnight of September 2013, which was about 35 per cent higher than the low levels recorded during the second fortnight of April 2013. Some decline in global crude prices in recent weeks as well as the reversal in the trend of rupee movement helped ease part of the pressure. The price of crude oil consequently declined to `6,544 per barrel as on October 24, 2013. restrain the twin de\ufb01 cits-\ufb01 scal and external. Such demand adjustments are also desirable for energy conservation and ef\ufb01 ciency in the use of a scarce and costly resource. Inflation in non-food manufactured products continued to moderate amidst slack demand Further hike in fuel prices needed; may help dampen demand VI.9 There have been concerted efforts to reduce the extent of suppressed in\ufb02 ation in the fuel segment. With the increase in fuel prices, there has been a significant slowdown in consumption in the recent period (Chart VI.7). Given the still large under-recoveries, there is need for further upward adjustment in fuel prices which would also dampen demand and VI.10 Non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation at 2.1 per cent (y-o-y) in September 2013 continued to remain muted (Chart VI.8). Three product groups viz., of chemicals, metals and machinery and machine tools, which account for about 58 per cent of the non-food manufactured products group, exhibited signi\ufb01 cantly lower in\ufb02 ation as compared to the rest. Negative in\ufb02 ation in metals during the current \ufb01 nancial year so far, which is in line with declining global metal prices, was one of the key factors pulling down overall in\ufb02 ation in this segment. VI.11 The slowdown in growth has led to a signi\ufb01 cant decline in pricing power as is evident from the trend available from purchasing manager index (PMI) (Chart VI.9). Though there was a pick-up in both input and output price indices in PMI in recent months, the gap between the two widened indicating that the \ufb01 rms are unable to pass on the full increase in input prices to output prices. Real rural wage growth moderated due to higher in\ufb02 ation VI.12 Though the growth in wages in rural areas declined in recent months, it continued to remain high in nominal terms and was in double-digits (Chart VI.10). High in\ufb02 ation, however, resulted in signi\ufb01 cant moderation of real wage growth. The level of real wages remained stagnant during the \ufb01 rst eight months of calendar year 2013. Rising food prices caused persistent high CPI in\ufb02 ation VI.13 Though WPI in\ufb02 ation has moderated in 2013-14 so far, CPI in\ufb02 ation, as per the new CPI, continued to remain near double-digit levels driven by high food inflation (Chart VI.11). Given the higher weight of food in CPI as compared with WPI, the food group contributed signi\ufb01 cantly to overall CPI in\ufb02 ation and divergence between WPI and CPI in\ufb02 ation. The food group, which has a weight of 47.6 per cent in the new CPI (combined) contributed about 56 per cent of the in\ufb02 ation in September 2013. VI.14 Food prices increased at a faster rate in urban areas as compared to rural areas in recent months, driven largely by higher in\ufb02 ation in vegetables in urban areas (Chart VI.12). It is also seen that vegetable prices are more volatile in urban areas as compared to rural areas. While trade and transport costs could explain part of the divergence in in\ufb02 ation between rural and urban areas, such large swings in prices could also indicate that the supply chain is not ef\ufb01 ciently integrated. VI.15 Excluding food and fuel, the new CPI inflation remained high at 8.6 per cent in transport and communication reflect pass- through of increase in fuel prices to transport costs. Persistent contribution from services, such as education and medical care, which are more labour-intensive, also indicate that sustained increases in wages (both in nominal and real terms) in the recent period fed into generalised in\ufb02 ation. This could partly explain the sticky in\ufb02 ation at the consumer level even in the midst of a growth slowdown. Risks to inflation largely in balance, though second-round effects may come into play September 2013 as compared to 2.3 per cent in WPI. The composition of the basket for excluding food and fuel differs signi\ufb01 cantly across CPI and WPI. CPI includes housing for which inflation is in double-digits. It also includes a miscellaneous group comprising of a number of services. The contribution of housing and transport communication has been significant in CPI-excluding food and fuel inflation (Chart VI.13). High inflation in VI.16 Risks to in\ufb02 ation ahead are largely in balance from here on, though second-round effects from already high food and fuel in\ufb02 ation in CPI in\ufb02 ation could continue. A good kharif crop could partly mitigate the pressure on food prices, both at the wholesale and retail levels. Still, upside risks remain from short-term domestic supply-side disturbances, the possibility of unforeseen global oil price spikes and possible adverse currency movements. After two years of growth deceleration, the slowdown extended into 2013-14 amid domestic structural constraints, dampened global cyclical conditions and dented business con\ufb01 dence. Growth forecasts by external agencies and professional forecasters have been revised downwards. In\ufb02 ation expectations and in\ufb02 ation have begun to edge up again as the second round impact of already high food and fuel prices has come into play. In these circumstances, the revival in growth will require complementary monetary, \ufb01 scal and regulatory policies. At this juncture, it is important to maintain macroeconomic stability so as to allow further impetus to growth to come from productivity enhancing structural reforms, addressing supply constraints and ensuring quick project implementation. VII.1 Indian economy has continued to slowdown for the third year in succession. In part, the slowdown is the result of global cyclical conditions that have resulted in most emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) slowing down. However, the slowdown has been exacerbated by domestic factors, a large part of which can be addressed through concerted policy actions and their implementation. Small but sustained policy steps can deliver growth back to the economy. Further productivity enhancements and containment of high wage in\ufb02 ation are possible by making labour markets more \ufb02 exible and by improving human capital formation given the abundant labour supplies. VII.2 To recoup India\u2019s potential growth, \ufb01 rst and foremost it will be necessary to secure macroeconomic stability as failure to do so can result in a lasting growth collapse. High persistent inflation is inimical to growth. In\ufb02 ation based on CPI-IW has averaged 9.5 per cent for the last six years and the headline WPI in\ufb02 ation has averaged 8.6 per cent during the last three years. Such high in\ufb02 ation eroded real consumption, lowered savings, caused \ufb01 nancial disintermediation, widened the current account gap and placed additional pressures for subsidised safety nets for the vulnerable population. Against this backdrop, monetary policy will have to tread a carefully charted course to support reasonable real interest rates and avert \ufb01 nancial repression. VII.3 Growth has slackened to a 17-quarter low of 4.4 per cent during Q1 of 2013-14. On current reckoning, growth in 2013-14 is likely to stay at about the level of last year. After a slower H1, a modest recovery is likely in H2 of 2013-14. This is expected to come from a rebound in agricultural growth backed by a better than normal south-west monsoon and a pick-up in exports. VII.4 While the current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD) risks have receded somewhat, what is important for now is that monetary and \ufb01 scal policies retain focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability. Meanwhile, structural policy measures and ground-level actions could work to boost growth over the medium-term. In\ufb02 ation may remain range-bound in H2 of 2013-14 but disinflation process is incomplete VII.5 The WPI in\ufb02 ation trajectory changed in Q2 of 2013-14 with a turnaround since July 2013. On the current assessment, WPI in\ufb02 ation may remain range bound around the current level during H2 of 2013-14. This indicates persistence of in\ufb02 ation at levels distinctly above what was indicated by the Reserve Bank earlier in the year. Even though non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation remains low at present due to dampened demand-side factors and lower commodity prices, persistence of in\ufb02 ation in H2 can arise as high food and fuel in\ufb02 ation exert some cost push pressures on manufactured product prices and as high wage in\ufb02 ation feeds through to general level of prices. that can impact prices across a wide range through transportation costs. Also, in\ufb02 ation expectations and demand factors can keep price pressures elevated in services segments like education and health. VII.6 An important element in shaping the inflation outcome during 2013-14 will be in\ufb02 ation in primary food articles that rose to 18.4 per cent in September 2013 mainly due to a significant escalation in vegetable prices during H1 of 2013-14. As a base case, food in\ufb02 ation should soften during H2 on the back of possible bumper foodgrains and oilseeds output. However, the degree of fall in food inflation will be conditioned by food management, the extent of ratchet effect in vegetable prices and supply responses in protein-rich products. Surveys show business confidence continues to weaken VII.8 The con\ufb01 dence channel has played an important role in the current growth slowdown. However, business confidence shows little improvement and continues to remain weak. This is indicated by moderation on a y-o-y and q-o-q basis in key indices of various surveys (Table VII.1). According to FICCI, weak demand, cost and availability of credit continue to be concerns. While the Dun and Bradstreet Business Con\ufb01 dence Index showed moderate improvement over the previous quarter, it remained below the level registered in Q4 of 2012-13. VII.7 A fall in food in\ufb02 ation is a prerequisite to bring CPI in\ufb02 ation to a more reasonable level in line with the trends in emerging markets. However, pending suf\ufb01 cient supply responses, it is important that monetary policy keeps a tight leash to prevent relative price shocks in the current year from getting generalised. While the negative output gap is likely to have a disin\ufb02 ationary impact, supply constraints and the absence of a sufficiently competitive industrial structure can moderate its effect. Persistence of CPI in\ufb02 ation could also come from the second round effects of exchange rate pass-through and administered price revisions The seasonally adjusted HSBC Markit VII.9 Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for both manufacturing and services contracted in September 2013. The index for output prices decelerated for both manufacturing and services while input prices for manufacturing accelerated during the month. Industrial Outlook Survey re\ufb02 ects weak business sentiment, moderation expected ahead VII.10 The Reserve Bank\u2019s 63rd round of the Industrial Outlook Survey (http://www.rbi.org. in/IOS63) conducted during August-September Table VII.1: Expectations surveys indicate weak optimism expectations remained well above the threshold level (Chart VII.1). VII.11 Analysis of the net responses among various components of demand conditions shows that while the sentiments on production remained broadly unchanged, the sentiments on order books, capacity utilisation, exports and imports dropped substantially for Q2 of 2013- 14. The outlook for Q3 of 2013-14 also shows similar sentiments. 2013, showed that in terms of assessment, the Business Expectation Index (BEI) dropped signi\ufb01 cantly for Q2 of 2013-14, falling below the threshold level of 100, separating contraction from expansion, and touching the lowest point since Q1 of 2009-10. For Q3 of 2013-14, VII.12 Perceptions on overall financial situation dropped substantially for Q3 of 2013- 14. The cost of external \ufb01 nance is perceived to rise, and the percentage of respondents expecting this to rise has increased for the \ufb01 rst time since Q4 of 2011-12. Cost of raw material and selling price are expected to increase in Q3 of 2013-14. The perception on pro\ufb01 t margins continues to remain in the negative terrain and Table VII.2: Business con\ufb01 dence continues to weaken 1 Net response is the percentage difference between optimistic (positive) and pessimistic (negative) responses; responses indicating status quo (no change) are not reckoned.

Further downward revision in India\u2019s growth projections by external agencies VII.14 Various external agencies have reduced India\u2019s growth projections. The external agencies\u2019 growth projections range between 4.3 to 5.9 per cent (Table VII.3). VII.15 The Reserve Bank\u2019s 25th round of the Survey of Professional Forecasters outside the Reserve Bank (http://www.rbi.org.in/ SPF25) also indicated a slowdown in growth. The median growth forecast for 2013-14 was revised downwards to 4.8 per cent from 5.7 per cent in the previous round, which is lower than the growth of 5.0 per cent registered during 2012-13. Average WPI in\ufb02 ation is expected to remain 6.0 per cent during the current year. Professional forecasters anticipated a reduction in the current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD) with a median forecast at 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2013- 14. The survey indicated moderate slippage in \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit (Table VII.4). Households\u2019 in\ufb02 ation expectations move up VII.16 The latest round of the Inflation Expectations Survey of Households (IESH Round 33) (http://www.rbi.org.in/IESH33) indicates that three-month ahead and one-year ahead median inflation expectations of households moved up in this quarter (July- September 2013) as compared with the previous quarter. The qualitative responses indicate that majority of the respondents expect price increases at \u2018more than current rate\u2019 (Chart VII.3).

However, macroeconomic risks still exist with some upward pressure on in\ufb02 ation 1 The forecasts re\ufb02 ect the views of professional forecasters and not of the Reserve Bank.

Despite the recent exchange rate stability, the external environment for the country is still fragile and buffers need to be rebuilt, including those by private agents. There is little scope for complacency at this stage, even though the rupee has gained strength. VII.18 At the present juncture, monetary policy faces an unenviable task of anchoring inflation expectations, even while growth remains tepid. It is, therefore, important to craft policy responses so that growth concerns are addressed in an environment of stable prices without endangering macroeconomic stability. For supporting growth, complementary action will be necessary aiming at productivity- enhancing structural reforms, addressing supply constraints and ensuring quick project implementation. ", "file13": "Following an assessment of the evolving macroeconomic situation, the Reserve Bank has decided to: \uf020 reduce the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate by 25 basis points from 9.0 per cent to 8.75 per cent with immediate effect; \uf020 increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 7.5 per cent to 7.75 per cent with immediate effect \uf020 keep cash reserve ratio (CRR) unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); and \uf020 increase the liquidity provided through term repos of 7-day and 14-day tenor from 0.25 per cent of NDTL of the banking system to 0.5 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.75 per cent and the Bank Rate stands reduced to 8.75 per cent with immediate effect. With these changes, the MSF rate and the Bank Rate are recalibrated to 100 basis points above the repo rate. Since the Mid-Quarter Review in September, the outlook for global growth has improved 2. modestly, with fiscal concerns abating in the US and lead indicators of activity firming up in the Euro area and the UK. In emerging and developing economies, the prospect of delay in the taper of the Federal 3. Reserve\u2019s bond purchases has brought calm to financial markets, and capital flows have resumed. Nevertheless, headwinds to growth from domestic constraints continue to pose downside risks, and vulnerabilities to sudden shifts in the external environment remain. In India, industrial activity has weakened, with a contraction in consumer durables and 4. tepid growth in capital goods reflecting the ongoing downturn in both consumption and investment demand. Strengthening export growth and signs of revival in some services, along with the expected pick-up in agriculture, could support an increase in growth in the second half of 2013-14 relative to the first half, raising real GDP growth from 4.4 per cent in Q1 to a central estimate of 5.0 per cent for the year as a whole (Chart 1). The revival of large stalled projects and the pipeline cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Investment may buoy investment and overall activity towards the close of the year. 5. In the meantime, with many large entities holding back on payments, liquidity pressures are building up on small and medium enterprises. A number are facing conditions of financial distress. Remedies partly lie in the speed-up of government and public sector payments, and on measures to channel credit to small and medium enterprises. Inflation measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) rose in September for the fourth 6. month in succession. The pass-through of rupee depreciation into prices of manufactured products is acting, along with elevated food and fuel inflation, to offset possible disinflationary effects of low growth. While food price pressures may ease with the arrival of the kharif harvest and the usual seasonal moderation, overall WPI inflation is expected to remain higher than current levels through most of the remaining part of the year (Chart 2), warranting an appropriate policy response. 7. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) has also risen sharply across food and non-food constituents, including services, keeping inflation expectations high. Notwithstanding the expected edging down of food inflation, retail inflation is likely to remain around or even above 9 per cent (Chart 3) in the months ahead, absent policy action. Liquidity management has been calibrated to the system\u2019s requirements arising from the 8. sharp pick-up in credit relative to deposit growth and festival-related demand for currency. Liquidity up to 0.5 per cent of bank-wise NDTL is available through overnight LAF repos. Furthermore, export credit refinance of up to 50 per cent of eligible export credit outstanding amounts to approximately 0.5 per cent of system-level NDTL. To provide market participants with additional access to primary liquidity, as well as greater flexibility in managing reserve requirements, term repos of 7-day and 14-day tenor have been introduced to provide liquidity equivalent to 0.25 per cent of NDTL. As a result of the measures taken by the Reserve Bank to ease liquidity, the average drawal on the MSF has declined significantly from about `1.4 trillion in mid-September to `0.4 trillion by mid-October, and money market rates have fallen by 125 basis points. Going forward, however, the more durable strategy for mitigating mismatches between the supply of, and demand for, funds is for banks to step up efforts to mobilise deposits. As regards the external sector, the improvement in export performance over the last two 9. months, coupled with the contraction in non-oil import demand, has enabled a perceptible narrowing of the trade deficit with favourable implications for the current account deficit (CAD) going forward. Policy interventions have bridged the external financing gap. These factors have brought some calm to the foreign exchange market. However, normalcy will be restored to the exchange market only when the demand for dollars from public sector oil marketing companies is fully returned to the market. From September, as steps to contain the CAD started taking effect in an improving 10. external environment, volatility in the foreign exchange market ebbed and it became possible to unwind the exceptional liquidity tightening measures. Keeping in view the need to infuse liquidity into the system to normalise liquidity conditions, term repos will now be conducted for a total notified amount equivalent to 0.5 per cent of NDTL of the banking system. In addition, the MSF rate will be reduced by 25 basis points. 11. With the more recent upturn of inflation, and with inflation expectations remaining elevated anticipating the pass-through of exchange rate depreciation and ongoing adjustment in administered fuel prices, it is important to break the spiral of rising price pressures in order to curb the erosion of financial saving and strengthen the foundations of growth. It is in this context that the LAF repo rate has been increased by 25 basis points. 12. With the reduction of the MSF rate and the increase in the repo rate in this review, the process of re-aligning the interest rate corridor to normal monetary policy operations is now complete. The policy stance and measures in this review are intended to curb mounting inflationary 13. pressures and manage inflation expectations in a situation of weak growth. These will help strengthen the environment for growth by fostering macroeconomic and financial stability. The Reserve Bank will closely monitor inflation risk while being mindful of the evolving growth dynamics. 14. a press release on Wednesday, December 18, 2013. The next Mid-Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2013-14 will be announced through Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2013-14 15. January 28, 2014. 16. This part of the Statement reviews the progress on various developmental and regulatory policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank in recent policy statements and also sets out new measures. The Reserve Bank\u2019s developmental measures over the next few quarters will be built on 17. five pillars. These are: a. Clarifying and strengthening the monetary policy framework. b. Strengthening banking structure through new entry, branch expansion, encouraging new varieties of banks, and moving foreign banks into better regulated organisational forms. c. Broadening and deepening financial markets and increasing their liquidity and resilience so that they can help absorb the risks entailed in financing India\u2019s growth. d. Expanding access to finance to small and medium enterprises, the unorganised sector, the poor, and remote and underserved areas of the country through measures to foster financial inclusion. Improving the system\u2019s ability to deal with corporate distress and financial institution distress by strengthening real and financial restructuring as well as debt recovery. 18. Action on the monetary policy framework will follow the submission of the Dr. Urjit Patel Committee report. A number of measures to strengthen bank structures and financial markets have already been announced, and more will follow as they are worked out. The strategy to expand financial inclusion will be informed by the Dr. Nachiket Mor Committee report, though significant efforts to explore the use of technology are already underway. Finally, some steps to improve restructuring and recovery will be announced soon. 19. As part of the Basel III capital framework, an internal Working Group (Chairman: Shri B. Mahapatra) was constituted to operationalise the countercyclical capital buffer framework in India. It is proposed to: \uf020 place the draft report of the group on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website by end-November 2013 for inviting comments/suggestions from various stakeholders. 20. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) provided a framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) in October 2012. The D-SIBs framework is principle-based and provides broad guidance to national authorities on assessment of the systemic importance of banks and additional capital requirements of D-SIBs. It is proposed to: \uf020 place a draft of the proposed framework for D-SIBs on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website by end- November 2013. 21. The Reserve Bank had issued guidelines on stress testing in June 2007. These guidelines required banks to have a sound stress testing policy which will determine liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk under stressed scenarios. Drawing from the BCBS principles on the subject and subsequent global developments, it is proposed to: \uf020 issue updated guidelines on stress testing by end-November 2013. 22. Unhedged foreign currency exposures of corporates are a cause for concern as they pose a risk to individual corporates as also to the entire financial system. Based on feedback received from industry participants, it is proposed to: \uf020 23. As per extant instructions, banks are required to pay interest on savings deposits and term deposits at quarterly or longer intervals. As all commercial banks are now on core banking platforms, it has been decided to: \uf020 give banks the option to pay interest on savings deposits and term deposits at intervals shorter than quarterly intervals. 24. In terms of the guidelines for licensing of new banks in the private sector released on February 22, 2013 applications will be screened by the Reserve Bank to ensure prima facie eligibility, and thereafter, the applications will be referred to a High Level Advisory Committee (HLAC). The HLAC will devise its own procedures for screening the applications and submit its recommendations to the Reserve Bank for consideration. The decision to issue an in-principle approval for setting up of a bank will be taken by the Reserve Bank whose decision in this regard will be final. 25. The HLAC has been set up under the Chairmanship of Dr. Bimal Jalan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank with Smt. Usha Thorat, former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Shri C.B. Bhave, former Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Dr. Nachiket M. Mor, Director, Central Board of Directors of the Reserve Bank as members. The Committee will hold its first meeting on November 1, 2013. Mode of Presence of Foreign Banks in India \u2013 Scheme of Subsidiarisation 26. As a sequel to the roadmap for presence of foreign banks in India released by the Reserve Bank in 2005 and pursuant to the announcement made in the Monetary Policy Statement of April 2010, the Reserve Bank released a Discussion Paper on the presence of foreign banks in India on January 21, 2011 factoring in the lessons from the crisis which favoured a subsidiary mode of presence from a financial stability perspective. Taking into account the feedback received from stakeholders, a scheme of subsidiarisation of foreign banks in India, guided by the two cardinal principles of reciprocity and single mode of presence, is being finalised. The Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOSs) would be given near-national treatment, including in the opening of branches. 27. While it will not be mandatory for existing foreign banks (i.e., banks set up before August 2010) to convert into WOSs, they will be incentivised to convert into WOSs by the attractiveness of the near-national treatment afforded to WOSs. The initial minimum paid-up voting equity capital or net worth for a WOS shall be `5 billion. It is proposed: \uf020 to issue the Scheme by mid-November 2013. The Union Budget, 2013-14 proposed to introduce instruments that will protect savings 28. from inflation and provide an alternative to gold as an investment avenue for individuals. Inflation indexed securities for retail investors of 10-year tenor would be linked to the new (combined) consumer price index. Eligible investors would consist of individuals, hindu undivided families (HUFs), trusts and charitable institutions. The rate of interest on these securities would comprise of a fixed rate plus inflation. Interest would be compounded half- yearly and paid cumulatively at redemption. These securities will be distributed through banks to reach out to the masses. Accordingly, it is proposed to: \uf020 29. In order to develop the money and government securities markets, it has been decided to introduce cash settled 10-year Interest Rate Futures (IRF) contracts. Product design and operational modalities are being discussed with all stakeholders, including market bodies and stock exchanges, and after taking into account their feedback, the Reserve Bank, in consultation with the SEBI, would: \uf020 issue guidelines by mid-November 2013 and the product is expected to be launched by the exchanges by end-December 2013. 30. result, corporates have significant dependence on bank financing. Therefore, it is proposed to: The corporate bond market in India currently lacks sufficient depth and liquidity. As a \uf020 allow banks to offer partial credit enhancements to corporate bonds by way of providing credit facilities and liquidity facilities to the corporates, and not by way of guarantee. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued separately. 31. With a view to facilitating settlement of electronic funds transfers as well as to reduce unnecessary volatility in reserve maintenance, it has been decided to: \uf020 revise the timing of MSF operations. With effect from November 5, 2013 they will be conducted between 7.00 pm and 7.30 pm instead of between 4.45 pm and 5.15 pm. 32. On July 17, 2013 the Reserve Bank had opened a special repo window for mutual funds with a view to enabling banks to meet the liquidity requirements of mutual funds. With the normalisation of exceptional measures and taking into consideration the improvement in liquidity conditions since then, it has been decided to close this window with immediate effect. Technical Committee on Services / Facilities for Exporters 33. (Chairman: Shri G. Padmanabhan) such as an increase in the limit of e-commerce transactions and extending the time period for submission of documents under project exports, simplification of reporting requirement of forward contracts booked over-the-counter (OTC) and extending the limit for exporters to cancel and rebook the forward contracts have been accepted and necessary guidelines have been issued. Other recommendations are being analysed in coordination with government agencies/other stakeholders for implementation. III. Developments and Policies: Financial Inclusion and Payment and Settlement Systems The coverage of the General Credit Card (GCC) Scheme is being revised to enhance 34. credit linkage of individuals to all non-farm entrepreneurial activities within the rubric of the overall priority sector. It is expected that the revised scheme will give a fillip to flow of credit to small businesses and low income households. Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued before mid-November 2013. State Level Bankers\u2019 Committees are mandated to prepare a roadmap covering all 35. unbanked villages of population less than 2000 and to notionally allot these villages to banks for providing banking services. Accordingly, about 4,90,000 unbanked villages have been identified and allotted to various banks to be covered by March 2016. In January 2013, the Reserve Bank constituted an Expert Committee (Chairman: Dr. 36. Prakash Bakshi) on the short-term co-operative credit structure. The recommendations taken up for implementation include, inter alia, improvement of governance and management of rural co- operatives, moving to Core Banking Solutions (CBSs) and setting up of a Working Group to examine human resources requirement of rural co-operative banks following the transition of state co-operative banks and district central co-operative banks to CBS. 37. With a view to ensuring reasonableness and equity in the charges levied by banks for sending SMS alerts to customers, banks are advised to leverage the technology available with them and the telecom service providers to ensure that such charges are levied on all customers on actual usage basis. 38. Following the report of the Committee for Implementation of GIRO Based Payment System highlighting the need for an electronic bill payment system based on a GIRO model for payment of dues of essential services, insurance premia, utility payments, taxes, university fees, examination fees and the like, a GIRO Advisory Group (Chairman: Prof. Umesh Bellur) has been constituted with representation from banks and other stakeholders. The Group is expected to submit its report by end-December 2013. Technical Committee on Expansion of Access to Mobile Banking 39. A Technical Committee (Chairman: Shri B. Sambamurthy) has been constituted to examine various options/alternatives, including the feasibility of encrypted SMS-based funds transfer using an application which can run on any type of handset, for expansion of mobile banking in the country. The Committee is expected to submit its report by end-December 2013. Security and Risk Mitigation Measures for Card Present and Electronic Payment Transactions 40. The Reserve Bank has advised banks to put in place by end-June 2013 security features in order to secure card transactions and the electronic banking infrastructure. A review of banks\u2019 preparedness in this regard indicates that technical glitches are hampering the transition to the desired environment. Accordingly, a one-time extension has been granted to stakeholders. Cash Pay-out from Prepaid Payment Instruments Issued by Non-bank Entities In order to further popularise prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) and facilitate remittance 41. of funds by people not having bank accounts, a pilot is being planned with select non-bank PPI issuers to study the technological and operational feasibility of allowing cash pay-out issued by non-bank entities using Aadhaar based bio-metric (remittance) from PPIs authentication. The broad technical, operational and functional parameters of the pilot are being finalised in consultation with participants and the pilot is expected to go live before end-March 2014. 42. The Reserve Bank\u2019s Working Group (Chairman: Shri B. Mahapatra) reviewed prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances by banks and financial institutions and relevant guidelines to banks have been issued. As NBFCs are also part of the financial institutions that lend to the sectors where restructuring benefits are now available, either as part of a consortium or otherwise, it has been decided to: \uf020 review the extant instructions on restructuring for NBFCs and issue guidelines in the matter by end-November 2013. 43. consumer protection and capacity building: It is proposed to implement the following recommendations of the FSLRC pertaining to \uf020 All instructions relating to consumer services/consumer protection would be consolidated and will be placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website as a single group of instructions by end- March 2014 and they will be examined for gaps, if any. \uf020 A Committee will be set up by the Reserve Bank to examine capacity building, including basic and job specific knowledge requirements and examine whether a system of formal certification is warranted for certain job descriptions within the Reserve Bank and in the financial entities and market segments regulated by it. \uf020 The Reserve Bank will examine its own public facing services and institute time-bound response guidelines where feasible and not already in place. Such guidelines will be placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website by January 2014. Currency Management: Distribution of Banknotes and Coins 44. Banks were advised to explore the possibility of meeting the growing demand for banknotes and coins in the country through Business Correspondents (BCs) and consider engaging the services of Cash in Transit (CIT) entities to address last mile connectivity issues. Instructions have been issued on September 10 and October 10, 2013, permitting banks to include distribution of banknotes and coins in the scope of activities which may be undertaken by BCs/CITs. 45. Banks have also enhanced their capacity to take over the retail function of distribution of far identified notes and coins and adjudication of mutilated notes. They have so 805 bank branches for the purpose. Correspondingly, the distribution level across the Reserve Bank\u2019s counters has decreased by 61 per cent and 64 per cent for notes and coins, respectively, and the adjudication of notes by 51 per cent. 46. In view of the recommendation of the Department-related Parliament Standing Committee (DPSC) to introduce a scheme of incentives in order to encourage banks to report counterfeit notes detected by them, instructions were issued to banks on June 27, 2013 on the procedure to be followed and compensation to banks for detection of counterfeit notes and penalty for non-detection/reporting thereof. ", "file14": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); and  increase the liquidity provided under 7-day and 14-day term repos from 0.5 per cent of NDTL of the banking system to 0.75 per cent, and decrease the liquidity provided under overnight repos under the LAF from 0.5 per cent of bank-wise NDTL to 0.25 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. Since the Third Quarter Review of January 2014, global activity appears to 2. have moderated on slower growth in the US, the UK and Japan, continuing sluggishness in the Euro area and a subdued pick-up in emerging and developing economies, restrained by the uncertain external demand environment as well as by localised cyclical and structural constraints. For a number of emerging markets, further tightening of external financing conditions and renewed volatility of capital flows are the biggest risks to their outlook. Going forward, global growth is likely to strengthen in the rest of the year, with risks tilted to the downside. 3. Domestically, real GDP growth continued to be modest in Q3 of 2013-14, with some strengthening of activity in services such as trade, hotels, transport and communication, and financing, real estate and business services. Despite some positive movement in more recent data, industrial activity continues to be a drag on the economy, with retrenchment in both consumption and investment demand reflected in the contraction of output of consumer durables as well as capital goods. In the quarters ahead, the boost provided by robust agricultural production in 2013 may wane. Moreover, the outlook for the 2014 south-west monsoon appears uncertain. Sluggishness in industrial activity, exports and several categories of services underlines the need to revitalise productivity and competitiveness. 4. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) moderated for the third month in succession in February 2014, driven lower by the sharp disinflation in food prices, although prices of fruits, milk and products have started to firm up. Excluding food and fuel, however, retail inflation remained sticky at around 8 per cent. This suggests that some demand pressures are still at play. 5. The merchandise trade deficit was 22 per cent lower in April-February 2013-14 than its level a year ago, due to the large decline in non-oil imports. The steady narrowing of the trade deficit over the year has shrunk the current account deficit (CAD) to 0.9 per cent of GDP in Q3 of 2013-14. For the year as a whole, the CAD is expected to be about 2.0 per cent of GDP. Most recently, however, export growth has slowed, partly because of slowdown in demand in partner countries as well as a softening of prices of exports of petroleum products and gems and jewellery (offset by a reduction in the prices of oil and gold imports). Whether the export slowdown persists as global growth picks up once again remains to be seen. In February, there was a turnaround in portfolio flows as investors largely priced in the effects of taper by the US Fed and responded to economic and geo-political developments in emerging markets with re-allocations. With sustained inflows in the form of portfolio flows, foreign direct investment (FDI) and external commercial borrowings, external financing conditions turned comfortable. Inflows, augmented by repayments by public sector oil marketing companies of their foreign currency obligations to the Reserve Bank during March, have led to an increase in reserves. 6. Turning to liquidity, envisaging pressures from large currency demand and tax outflows from mid-March, a 21-day term repo of ` 500 billion was conducted on March 14 and 7-day term repo auctions of ` 100 billion on March 19 and 26, in addition to the regular 14-day term repo of ` 400 billion on March 21. A 5-day term repo for a notified amount of `200 billion was conducted on March 28 to facilitate non-disruptive banking operations during the annual closing of accounts. Access to the MSF on March 29 and 31 (holidays) was also allowed for this purpose. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor the liquidity conditions and actively manage liquidity to ensure adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors. Policy Stance and Rationale 7. Since December 2013, the sharper than expected disinflation in vegetable prices has enabled a sizable fall in headline inflation. Looking ahead, vegetable prices have entered their seasonal trough and further softening is unlikely. Meanwhile, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has remained flat. There are risks to the central forecast of 8 per cent CPI inflation by January 8. 2015 stemming from a less-than-normal monsoon due to possible el nino effects; uncertainty on the setting of minimum support prices for agricultural commodities and the setting of other administered prices, especially of fuel, fertiliser and electricity; the outlook for fiscal policy; geo-political developments and their impact on international commodity prices. There will also be a downward statistical pull on CPI inflation exerted by base effects of high inflation during June-November 2013. It is critical to look through any transient effects, including these base effects, which could temporarily soften headline inflation during 2014 (Chart 1). 9. The Reserve Bank\u2019s policy stance will be firmly focussed on keeping the economy on a disinflationary glide path that is intended to hit 8 per cent CPI inflation by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016. At the current juncture, it is appropriate to hold the policy rate, while allowing the rate increases undertaken during September 2013-January 2014 to work their way through the economy. Furthermore, if inflation continues along the intended glide path, further policy tightening in the near term is not anticipated at this juncture. 10. Contingent upon the desired inflation outcome, real GDP growth is projected to pick up from a little below 5 per cent in 2013-14 to a range of 5 to 6 per cent in 2014-15 albeit with downside risks to the central estimate of 5.5 per cent (Chart 2). Lead indicators do not point to any sustained revival in industry and services as yet, and the outlook for the agricultural sector is contingent upon the timely arrival and spread of the monsoon. Easing of domestic supply bottlenecks and progress on the implementation of stalled projects already cleared should brighten up the growth outlook, as would stronger anticipated export growth as the world economy picks up. 11. In pursuance of the Dr. Urjit R. Patel Committee\u2019s recommendation to de- emphasise overnight \u201cguaranteed-access\u201d windows for liquidity management and progressively conduct liquidity management through term repos, the Reserve Bank has decided to further reduce access to overnight repos under the LAF while compensating fully with a commensurate expansion of the market\u2019s access to term repos from the Reserve Bank. The primary objective is to improve the transmission of policy impulses across the interest rate spectrum. The term repo has evolved as a useful indicator of underlying liquidity conditions. It also allows market participants to hold liquidity for a longer period, thereby providing the impetus for engaging in term transactions in the market, evolving market-based benchmarks for pricing various financial products and also improving efficiency in cash/treasury management. 12. Liquidity conditions have tightened in March, partly on account of year-end \u2018window dressing\u2019 by banks, though an extraordinary infusion of liquidity by the Reserve Bank has mitigated the tightness. The Reserve Bank will propose measures to reduce such practices. The second bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday, 13. June 3, 2014. This part of the Statement reviews the progress on various developmental and 14. regulatory policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank in recent policy statements and also sets out new measures. In the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2013-14 announced in 15. October 2013, the Reserve Bank set out a five-pillar framework to guide its developmental and regulatory measures. Noteworthy progress has since been made in implementing measures within this framework. 16. Some of the recommendations of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework (Chairman: Dr. Urjit R. Patel) have been implemented including adoption of the new CPI (combined) as the key measure of inflation, explicit recognition of the glide path for disinflation, transition to a bi-monthly monetary policy cycle, progressive reduction in access to overnight liquidity under the LAF at the fixed repo rate and corresponding increase in access to liquidity through term repos, and introduction of longer tenor term repos. 17. On strengthening banking structure, which is the second pillar, the High Level Advisory Committee (Chairman: Dr. Bimal Jalan) has recently submitted its recommendations to the Reserve Bank on the licensing of new banks. The Reserve Bank will announce in-principle approval for new licences after consulting with the Election Commission. Immediately afterwards, the Reserve Bank will start working on the framework for on-tap licensing as well as differentiated bank licences, building on the Discussion Paper on \u201cBanking Structure in India \u2013 The Way Forward\u201d placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website in August 2013 and using the learning from the recent licensing process. The intent is to expand the variety and efficiency of players in the banking system while maintaining financial stability. The Reserve Bank will also be open to banking mergers, provided competition and stability are not compromised. 18. Progress has been made on a number of regulatory and supervisory measures. Based on the comments/feedback received on the draft framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), the final framework is proposed to be issued by end-May 2014. As the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) stipulated by the Basel Committee becomes a standard with effect from January 1, 2015 it is proposed to issue guidelines relating to Basel III LCR and Liquidity Risk Monitoring tools by end-May 2014. Updated guidelines on stress testing, drawing from Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) principles and subsequent global developments, were issued in December 2013. Capital and provisioning requirements on banks' advances to corporates with unhedged foreign currency exposures were specified in January 2014. The draft report of the Internal Working Group (Chairman: Shri B. Mahapatra), which was constituted to operationalise the countercyclical capital buffer framework in India, was placed on the Reserve Bank's website for comments in December 2013. On the basis of the recommendations of the Committee on Comprehensive Financial Services for Small Businesses and Low Income Households (Chairman: Dr. Nachiket Mor) to encourage banks to actively manage their exposures to various sectors, including priority sectors, it is proposed to prescribe certain additional disclosure requirements in the financial statements by end-June 2014. Following industry-wide concerns about asset quality and the consequential 19. impact on the performance/profitability of banks, the Reserve Bank has extended the transitional period for full implementation of Basel III Capital Regulations in India up to March 31, 2019, instead of as on March 31, 2018. This will also align full implementation of Basel III in India closer to the internationally agreed date of January 1, 2019. 20. The Reserve Bank has moved over to risk-based supervision (RBS) for scheduled commercial banks (SCBs), starting with banks that were more prepared. Based on the experience gained from the completion of Phase I and the feedback received on the RBS framework from banks, the framework is being fine-tuned. Banks are also being advised to assess their risk management architecture, practices, related processes and management information systems (MIS) to facilitate their switch over to RBS in Phase II. 21. As regards the third pillar on the broadening and deepening of financial markets, Inflation Indexed National Saving Securities (IINSSs) for retail investors were issued in December 2013. To expand investor demand, certain design changes are required. Some such as an increase in the limit for individual investors and trusts have been implemented. Others such as tradability (and consequently, the benefit of indexation for capital gains tax) and issuance of securities with regular coupon flows are being contemplated. Cash settled single bond 10 year Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) were introduced by stock exchanges in January 2014. The Reserve Bank will shortly issue guidelines that would allow banks to offer partial credit enhancements to corporate bonds. As recommended by the Working Group on Enhancing Liquidity in the Government Securities and Interest Rate Derivatives Markets (Chairman: Shri R. Gandhi), the Reserve Bank proposes to introduce a market making scheme for primary dealers (PDs) by allocating specific securities to PDs and ensuring continuous availability of prices, with a suitable framework for assessing the performance of PDs. It will also examine the possibility of limited re-repo/re- hypothecation of \"repoed\" government securities, subject to appropriate risk control measures. 22. The Committee on Financial Benchmarks (Chairman: Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar) submitted its report in February 2014. The Committee has recommended several measures/principles to be adopted in respect of major Indian rupee interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks to strengthen their quality, the methodology by which they are set and the governance framework. Banks and PDs are being advised to strengthen their governance frameworks on benchmark submissions, subject to the supervisory review of the Reserve Bank. Other recommendations will be implemented in consultation with the Fixed Income, Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) and Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (FEDAI). 23. The Reserve Bank will continue to work to ease entry while reducing risk to foreign investors from the volatility of flows. The modalities for allowing FIIs to hedge their currency risk by using exchange traded currency futures in the domestic exchanges are being finalised in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). In order to enhance hedging facilities for foreign investors in debt instruments, it is proposed to allow them to hedge the coupon receipts falling due during the next 12 months. Rebooking of cancelled contracts in case of contracted exposures has been fully restored. It is further proposed to allow all resident individuals, firms and companies with actual foreign exchange exposures to book foreign exchange derivative contracts up to US$ 250,000 on declaration, subject to certain conditions. 24. Revised regulations under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) for a simplified foreign portfolio investor (FPI) regime have been notified in March 2014. The Reserve Bank also proposes to simplify the know-your-customer (KYC) procedures for opening bank accounts by FPIs. The Reserve Bank has also been rationalising and expanding limits for FPI investments in debt markets. To encourage longer maturity flows, investment limits in Treasury Bills were capped at US$ 5.5 billion in April 2013, even while the limit for long-term investors was increased by US$ 5 billion in June 2013. As a further step towards encouraging longer-term flows, investments by FPIs in G-Secs shall henceforth be permitted only in dated securities of residual maturity of one year and above, and existing investment in Treasury Bills will be allowed to taper off on maturity/sale. The overall limit for FPI investment in G- Secs will, however, remain unchanged at US$ 30 billion, so the investment limits vacated at the shorter end will be available at longer maturities. As regards foreign direct investment (FDI), it has been decided to withdraw all the existing guidelines relating to valuation in case of any acquisition/sale of shares and accordingly, such transactions will henceforth be based on acceptable market practices. Operating guidelines will be notified separately. 25. A comprehensive IT-based system namely, Export Data Processing and Monitoring System tracking and reconciliation of export transactions was launched in February 2014. The data will be shared among the stakeholders/agencies involved, and will allow more timely and detailed information on exports as well as prevention of export-related fraud. (EDPMS) 26. On financial inclusion, the fourth pillar, the recommendations of the Mor Committee on accelerating the flow of credit to those at the bottom of the pyramid and enlargement of catchment area of the Business Correspondents (BCs), including through possible inclusion of new entities as BCs, are under examination. To overcome the challenge of cash management of BCs which is impeding the scaling up of the BC model, the Reserve Bank will collate best practices and issue a fresh set of guidelines to commercial banks. The Reserve Bank has released a concept paper on Trade Receivables and 27. Credit Exchange for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in March 2014 on its website for public feedback. The model outlined in the paper envisages a credit exchange with both primary and secondary market segments that will help address problems faced by the MSME segment on delayed payments and dependency on their corporate buyers. After receiving feedback, the Reserve Bank will work towards implementation. 28. With a view to ensuring fair and transparent credit pricing and to give a fillip to the flow of credit to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) borrowers, it would be desirable for SCBs to provide differential interest rates for MSEs and other borrowers whose loans are covered under the credit guarantee scheme. SCBs are encouraged to undertake a review of their loan policy governing extension of credit facilities to the MSE sector and should consider using Board approved credit scoring models in their evaluation of the loan proposals of MSE borrowers. 29. Measures have been taken to expand banking services to the financially excluded sections of society with the appropriate application of technology. The GIRO Advisory Group (GAG) has recommended a tiered structure approach for a centralised bill payment system that will enable inter-operability viz., (a) Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) and (b) Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units (BBPOUs). The recommendations of the GAG report are under examination. A Technical Committee (Chairman: Shri B. Sambamurthy) set up to examine the challenges being faced by banks in taking mobile banking forward for achieving financial inclusion submitted its report in January 2014. This was placed in the public domain for feedback. The recommendations of the Committee will be examined closely, and plans for the way forward will be discussed with stakeholders. 30. Consumer protection is an integral aspect of financial inclusion. The Reserve Bank proposes to frame comprehensive consumer protection regulations based on domestic experience and global best practices. In the interest of their consumers, banks should consider allowing their borrowers the possibility of prepaying floating rate term loans without any penalty. Banks should also not take undue advantage of customer difficulty or inattention. Instead of levying penal charges for non- maintenance of minimum balance in ordinary savings bank accounts, banks should limit services available on such accounts to those available to Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts and restore the services when the balances improve to the minimum required level. Banks should not levy penal charges for non-maintenance of minimum balances in any inoperative account. Banks should also limit the liability of customers in electronic banking transactions in cases where banks are not able to prove customer negligence. 31. Under the fifth pillar, on improving the system's ability to deal with corporate distress and financial institution distress by strengthening real and financial restructuring as well as debt recovery, the Reserve Bank issued a framework for revitalising distressed assets in the economy in January 2014. The framework lays down guidelines for early recognition of financial distress, steps for prompt resolution and fair recovery for lenders. It envisages centralised reporting and dissemination of information on large credits, early formation of lenders' forums and incentives for lenders and borrowers to agree on resolution and disincentives for both in the event of failure to act in a timely way. Improvements in the current restructuring process such as an independent evaluation of large value restructuring with a focus on viability and fair sharing of gains and losses between promoters and creditors have been mandated. Finally, a more liberal regulatory treatment of distressed asset sales, particularly to asset reconstruction companies, has been provided. The framework will be fully effective from today. 32. Following the announcement in the Second Quarter Review of October 30, 2013, a Working Group (Chairmen: Dr. Arvind Mayaram and Shri Anand Sinha) on a Resolution Regime for Financial Institutions was constituted, which submitted its report in January 2014. The Group has, inter alia, recommended the setting up of a single Financial Resolution Authority (FRA), an early supervisory intervention mechanism in the form of prompt corrective action (PCA) framework for all financial institutions and a separate comprehensive legal framework providing necessary powers and tools for orderly resolution of all financial institutions irrespective of ownership. The Group's report will be disseminated for comments. 33. An overhaul of the extant regulatory framework for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) is underway to align it with several important developments which have taken place in the financial sector. It is, therefore, proposed to keep in abeyance, subject to certain exceptions, issue of Certificate of Registration (CoR) for conducting NBFC business, except in the public interest, till an appropriate regulatory framework is put in place for the NBFC sector. Detailed notification will be issued separately. 34. Going forward, this five-pillar approach will continue to guide the design and calibration of developmental measures. With competition in the banking sector set to increase, financial markets will play a complementary role, allowing banks to trade their long term assets and match the maturity profile of assets and liabilities. Simultaneously, the Reserve Bank will strive to increase the reach of financial services to everyone, however remote or small, by using technology, new products, and new entities to link people up to the formal financial system. Priority sector lending will become an effective vehicle to promote greater financial access. Concomitantly, the Reserve Bank will take steps for early recognition and resolution of distress with a focus on putting real assets back to work in their best use. ", "file15": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to:   increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 7.75 per cent to 8.0 per cent; and keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL). Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. Since the Mid-Quarter Review of December 2013, the global recovery is 2. gaining traction, led by the strengthening of the US economy, but it is still uneven and subdued in the Euro area and Japan, and a slowdown in China seems to be underway. Notwithstanding the boost from stronger external demand, uncertainty continues to surround the prospects for some emerging economies, with domestic fragilities getting accentuated. Financial market contagion is a clear potential risk. Domestically, some loss of momentum of growth is likely in Q3 of 2013-14, 3. despite a strong pick-up in rabi sowing. Industrial activity remains in contractionary mode, mainly on account of manufacturing, which declined for the second month in succession during Q3. Consumption demand continues to weaken and lacklustre capital goods production points to stalled investment demand. Fiscal tightening through Q3 and Q4 is likely to exacerbate the weakness in aggregate demand. Lead indicators of services suggest a subdued outlook, barring some pick-up in transport and communication activity. 4. While retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) declined significantly on account of the anticipated disinflation in vegetable and fruit prices, it remains elevated at close to double digits. Moreover, inflation excluding food and fuel has also been high, especially in respect of services, indicative of wage pressures and other second round effects. In terms of the wholesale price index (WPI), headline inflation eased to a four-month low with the sharp decline in vegetable and fruit prices. Non-food manufactured products (NFMP) inflation, however, rose in December on an uptick in prices of chemicals, non-metallic minerals and paper products. Hardening prices of services and key intermediates seen in conjunction with rising bank credit, increase in order books, pick-up in capacity utilisation and the decline in inventories of raw materials and finished goods in relation to sales suggests that aggregate demand pressures are still imparting an upside to overall inflation. It is critical to address these risks to the inflation outlook resolutely in order to stabilise and anchor inflation expectations, even while recognising the economy is weak and substantial fiscal tightening is likely in Q4. 1 Liquidity conditions were impacted by the mid-December advance tax 5. outflows. Recourse to the MSF rose from an average of `27 billion during the first half of December to an average of `250 billion in the second half, and the weighted average call rate moved up to 8.4 per cent from sub-LAF overnight repo rate levels. Although liquidity eased in the first week of January 2014 due to large redemptions by the Government, it started tightening thereafter with the build-up of Government\u2019s cash balances with the Reserve Bank. In order to normalise liquidity conditions in the face of these frictional pressures, the Reserve Bank conducted 7-day term repos of `100 billion on January 10, followed by 28-day term repos on January 17 and 21 cumulating to `300 billion, in addition to the normal liquidity provision of `1.4 trillion under overnight, 7-day and 14-day repos, and export credit refinance taken together. After assessing that market liquidity would likely remain tight for a while, and keeping in view the need to accommodate normal credit growth, open market purchase operations of `95 billion were conducted on January 22 in order to provide liquidity of a more permanent nature. The weighted average call rate has eased in response to these operations. The Reserve Bank is engaged in active management of liquidity to offset frictional and structural pressures so that there is adequate credit flow to the supply side of the economy. 6. For the period April-December 2013, the trade deficit has shrunk by 25 per cent from its level a year ago, with merchandise exports increasing on a y-o-y basis for the sixth consecutive month in December, while non-oil imports have continued to decline. Accordingly, the current account deficit (CAD) for 2013-14 is expected to be below 2.5 per cent of GDP as compared with 4.8 per cent in 2012-13. The recent resumption of portfolio flows, both equity and debt, alongside the pick-up in FDI and external commercial borrowings that is underway should help finance the current account deficit comfortably. Reserves have been rebuilt since September, and oil marketing companies have been buying foreign exchange in the market to repay the Reserve Bank when their swaps come due. Despite a significantly more comfortable external position than in the summer of 2013, both fiscal and monetary authorities need to continue their efforts at macroeconomic stabilisation. Policy Stance and Rationale 7. In the Mid-Quarter Review on December 18, 2013, the policy decision was to wait for more data before acting. With the subsequent substantial fall in food prices, especially of vegetables, headline inflation has fallen significantly. Some of these effects will continue into the next round of data readings. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has, however, remained flat and WPI inflation excluding food and fuel has risen. 8. The Dr. Urjit Patel Committee has indicated a \u201cglide path\u201d for disinflation that sets an objective of below 8 per cent CPI inflation by January 2015 and below 6 per cent CPI inflation by January 2016. The Reserve Bank\u2019s baseline projections set out in the accompanying Review of Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments for Q3 of 2013-14 indicate that over the ensuing 12-month horizon, and with the current policy stance, there are upside risks to the central forecast of 8 per cent. An increase in the policy rate will not only be consistent with the guidance given in the Mid- Quarter Review but also will set the economy securely on the recommended 2 disinflationary path. The extent and direction of further policy steps will be data dependent, though if the disinflationary process evolves according to this baseline projection, further policy tightening in the near term is not anticipated at this juncture. 9. If policy actions succeed in delivering the desired inflation outcome, real GDP growth can be expected to firm up from a little below 5 per cent in 2013-14 to a range of 5 to 6 per cent in 2014-15, with risks balanced around the central estimate of 5.5 per cent. A pick-up in investment in an environment in which external demand continues to be supportive of export performance could impart an upside to this forecast. Chart 2: Quarterly Projection of GDP growth (y-o-y) for 2013-14 and 2014-15 10. Hereafter, following the recommendation of the Dr. Urjit Patel Committee, monetary policy reviews will ordinarily be undertaken in a two-monthly cycle, consistent with the availability of key macroeconomic and financial data. Accordingly, the next policy review is scheduled on Tuesday, April 1, 2014. t n e c r e P ", "file16": "A detailed assessment of macroeconomic I.1 and monetary developments was released along with the monetary policy statement of January 28, 2014. This economic review provides an update taking into account the subsequent data releases. Recovery is on track in 2014, though tightening \ufb01 nancial conditions and the divergence in in\ufb02 ation pose risks Since the January 2014 monetary policy I.2 statement, global growth outlook remains broadly unchanged though weaker initial data to some extent cloud optimism. Global economic activity had strengthened in H2 of 2013. On the current reckoning, global growth is likely to be in the vicinity of 3\u00bd per cent in 2014, about \u00bd a percentage point higher than in 2013. The expansion in global output is expected to be led by advanced economies (AEs), especially the US. However, downside risks to growth trajectory arise from ongoing tapering of quantitative easing (QE) in the US, continuing de\ufb02 ation concerns and weak balance sheets in the euro area and, inflationary pressures in the emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Weakening growth and \ufb01 nancial fragilities in China that have arisen from rapid credit in recent years pose a large risk to global trade and growth. I.4 Global in\ufb02 ation remains benign with activity levels staying below potential in the AEs as well as in some large EMDEs and a softer bias for global commodity prices continuing into 2014. However, in\ufb02 ation in many EMDEs remains high, though actions in tightening monetary policy and slack in output are expected to help generate some disinflationary momentum. The divergent trends in in\ufb02 ation between AEs and EMDEs pose an added risk to global growth. I.5 After the unexpected shock from the May 2013 tapering indication by the US Fed, global \ufb01 nancial markets have weathered the initial dose of actual tapering of the quantitative easing (QE) quite well. However, the global interest rate cycle has just begun to turn. Moreover, a large part of the withdrawal of monetary accommodation by AEs remains to play out. Consequently, capital \ufb02 ows to EMDEs could remain volatile, even if they do not retrench. Also, with corporate leverage rising in many EMDEs, capital \ufb02 ow volatility could translate into liquidity shocks impacting asset prices. The Indian economy is set on a disin\ufb02 ationary path, but more efforts may be needed to secure recovery I.3 Growth also picked up in the EMDEs during H2 of 2013, but the momentum looks weaker than in the AEs and it faces new risks. Improved EMDE growth emanated largely from external demand on the back of currency depreciation in these countries. Going forward, drag on its sustainability may emerge from tightening monetary and \ufb01 nancial conditions that can intensify further in case of a faster- than-anticipated withdrawal of monetary accommodation by the AEs. Recent sovereign rating downgrade for Brazil and downward revision in rating outlook for Russia has also added to the growth risks for EMDEs. I.6 While the global environment remains challenging, policy action in India has rebuilt buffers to cushion it against possible spillovers. These buffers effectively bulwarked the Indian economy against the two recent occasions of spillovers to EMDEs \u2014 the \ufb01 rst, when the US Fed started the withdrawal of its large scale asset purchase programme and the second, which followed escalation of the Ukraine crisis. On both these occasions, Indian markets were less volatile than most of its emerging market peers. With the narrowing of the twin de\ufb01 cits \u2013 both current account and fiscal \u2013 as well as the replenishment of foreign exchange reserves, adjustment of the rupee exchange rate, and more importantly, setting in motion disin\ufb02 ationary impulses, the risks of near-term macro instability have diminished. However, this in itself constitutes only a necessary, but not a suf\ufb01 cient, condition for ensuring economic recovery. Much more efforts in terms of removing structural impediments, building business con\ufb01 dence and creating \ufb01 scal space to support investments will be needed to secure growth. Annual average CPI inflation has I.7 touched double digits or stayed just below for the last six years. This has had a debilitating effect on macro-financial stability through several channels and has resulted in a rise in inflation expectations and contributed to \ufb01 nancial disintermediation, lower \ufb01 nancial and overall savings, a wider current account gap and a weaker currency. A weaker currency was an inevitable outcome given the large in\ufb02 ation differential with not just the AEs, but also EMDEs. High inflation also had adverse consequences for growth. With the bene\ufb01 t of hindsight, it appears that the monetary policy tightening cycle started somewhat late in March 2010 and was blunted by a series of supply-side disruptions that raised in\ufb02 ation expectations and resulted in its persistence. Also, the withdrawal of the \ufb01 scal stimulus following the global \ufb01 nancial crisis was delayed considerably longer than necessary and may have contributed to structural increases in wage in\ufb02 ation through inadequately targeted subsidies and safety net programmes. I.8 Since H2 of 2012-13, demand management through monetary and fiscal policies has been brought in better sync with each other with de\ufb01 cit targets being largely met. Monetary policy had effectively raised operational policy rates by 525 basis points (bps) during March 2010 to October 2011. Thereafter, pausing till April 2012, the Reserve Bank cut policy rates by 75 bps during April 2012 and May 2013 for supporting growth. Delayed \ufb01 scal adjustment materialised only in H2 of 2012-13, by which time the current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD) had widened considerably. The easing course of monetary policy was disrupted by \u2018tapering\u2019 fears in May 2013 that caused capital outflows and exchange rate pressures amid unsustainable CAD, as also renewed in\ufb02 ationary pressures on the back of the rupee depreciation and a vegetable price shock. The Reserve Bank resorted to exceptional policy measures for further tightening the monetary policy. As a \ufb01 rst line of defence, short- term interest rates were raised by increasing the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate by 200 bps and curtailing liquidity available under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) since July 2013. As orderly conditions were restored in the currency market by September 2013, the Reserve Bank quickly moved to normalise the exceptional liquidity and monetary measures by lowering the MSF rate by 150 bps in three steps. However, with a view to containing in\ufb02 ation that was once again rising, the policy repo rate was hiked by 75 bps in three steps. I.9 Recent tightening, especially the last round of hike in January 2014, was aimed at containing the second round effects of the food price pressures felt during June-November 2013. Since then, in\ufb02 ation expectations have somewhat moderated and the temporary relative price shock from higher vegetable prices has substantially corrected along with a seasonal fall in these prices, without further escalation in ex-food and fuel CPI in\ufb02 ation. While headline CPI in\ufb02 ation receded over the last three months from 11.2 per cent in November 2013 to 8.1 per cent in February 2014, the persistence of ex-food and fuel CPI in\ufb02 ation at around 8 per cent for the last 20 months poses dif\ufb01 cult challenges to monetary policy. I.10 Against this background there are three important considerations for the monetary policy ahead. First, the disin\ufb02 ationary process is already underway with the headline in\ufb02 ation trending down in line with the glide path envisaged by the Urjit Patel Committee, though inflation stays well above comfort levels. Second, growth concerns remain signi\ufb01 cant with GDP growth staying sub-5 per cent for seven successive quarters and index of industrial production (IIP) growth stagnating for two successive years. Third, though a negative output gap has prevailed for long, there is clear evidence that potential growth has fallen considerably with high in\ufb02 ation and low growth. This means that monetary policy needs to be conscious of the impact of supply-side constraints on long-run growth, recognising that the negative output gap may be minimal at this stage. Growth stays low, structural constraints affect potential output II.1 Growth in the Indian economy had been shifting down from 9.6 per cent in Q4 of 2010- 11. It troughed around 4.4 per cent for three quarters from Q3 of 2012-13 to Q1 of 2013-14. Since then there are signs of growth bottoming out with marginal improvement recorded during Q2 and Q3 of 2013-14 to 4.8 and 4.7 per cent respectively. However, this improvement has been feeble and clear signs of recovery are yet to emerge, even as the economy seems to be gearing for a modest recovery during 2014-15. and low business con\ufb01 dence contributed to the decline in potential growth, particularly in the absence of adequate structural policy measures to lower in\ufb02 ation on a durable basis through improved supply responses and to facilitate implementation of large investment projects. Estimates of potential output are subject to considerable uncertainties given that they are sensitive to choice of methodologies, the time period used for estimation and end-period growth rates and have to be interpreted with judgment. On current reckoning, the economy seems to be running a negative output gap of about one percentage point, though the error bands around this estimate are wide . The downward spiral in growth caused II.2 in large part by structural factors that impeded investment activity had a profound effect on India\u2019s potential growth. On the basis of a simple Hodrick-Prescott (HP) \ufb01 lter on quarterly output levels, India\u2019s potential growth appears to have dropped from 8-8.5 per cent during the period Q2:2005-06 to Q3:2008-09 to around 6 per cent during the period Q2:2012-13 to Q3:2013-14 (Chart II.1). The wide range of estimates using alternative techniques, on balance, suggests that currently the potential growth may be even somewhat lower than 6.0 per cent. Decline in \ufb01 nancial savings, sluggish growth in fixed capital formation over successive quarters, persistently high in\ufb02 ation Agriculture sector witnessed record production II.3 The satisfactory monsoon and the absence of extreme climatic events until lately augur well for agricultural production and rural demand. Adequate replenishment of soil moisture and reservoirs signi\ufb01 cantly boosted crop production during 2013-14. As per the second advance estimates, the production of rice, wheat, pulses, oilseeds and cotton during 2013-14 have been estimated to be the highest ever. However, preliminary reports suggest that the unseasonal rains accompanied by hailstorm, and frost during early March 2014 in various parts of the country has adversely affected rabi crops like wheat, mustard seeds, onions and jowar. The possible effects of El Nino on the monsoon also add an additional element of uncertainty for future harvests. In this backdrop, the ability to meet increased food demand in the context of the implementation of the National Food Security Act, in the face of tightening farm labour markets and rising input costs remains a challenge. Industrial growth stagnating The Index of Industrial Production II.4 (IIP) showed no increase during April-January 2013-14, compared with 1.0 per cent growth in the corresponding period of the previous year. This stagnation in growth over two years re\ufb02 ects subdued investment and consumption demand. This has resulted in contraction in production of capital goods and consumer durables in the current year. Output of basic metals, fabricated metal products, machinery and equipment, motor vehicles, food products, gems and jewellery and communication equipment recorded a decline. Growth of core industries, which provide key inputs to the industrial sector, remained sluggish at 2.4 per cent during April-January 2013-14 compared to a growth of 6.9 per in the corresponding period a year ago. This sluggishness, in part, re\ufb02 ects contraction in natural gas and crude oil production and slow growth in all other infrastructure industries, except electricity. to sales ratio also declined in Q3 of 2013-14 over the previous quarter. Lead indicators of services sector indicate an uptick The developments in lead indicators of II.6 the services sector activity signal improvement in most segments except cement production and in commercial vehicle sales. Weak consumer con\ufb01 dence has impacted the sale of passenger cars, commercial vehicles and three wheelers. The reduction in excise duty on passenger vehicles and two wheelers in the interim budget for 2014-15, is expected to provide some boost to this sector. Employment scenario showing signs of gradual recuperation II.7 As per the labour bureau survey, employment generation in eight key sectors that was moderating since January 2012 showed some improvement in July-September 2013 vis-a-vis the previous quarter. Some of the private data sources of employment in the organised sector have also registered uptick in hiring since Q2 of 2013-14. The IT-BPO sector contributed to this improvement along with other sectors such as textiles, telecom, pharmaceuticals as well as travel/tourism. Capacity utilisation remained range bound Aggregate demand continued to moderate in Q3 of 2013-14, even as net exports remained buoyant1 II.5 Capacity utilisation (CU), as measured by the 24th round of the Order Books, Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank, remained largely \ufb02 at in Q3 of 2013-14 (http://www.rbi. org.in/OBICUS24). This is also re\ufb02 ected in the detrended IIP. Although the current level of CU is lower than that in the corresponding period of the previous year, new orders witnessed substantial growth on both q-o-q as well as y-o-y basis. Finished goods inventory II.8 In contrast to the pick-up in GDP growth at factor cost, the GDP growth at market prices during Q3 of 2013-14 moderated, re\ufb02 ecting lower mobilisation of net indirect taxes. Component-wise, both private and government final consumption expenditure continued to decelerate while \ufb01 xed investment contracted in Q3. The weighted contribution of net exports to overall growth continued to remain the highest amongst all the components of GDP\u2019s expenditure side. 1 Despite the well known limitations, expenditure-side GDP data are being used as proxies for components of aggregate demand. Efforts to address infrastructure bottlenecks have yielded modest revival so far II.9 By the end of January 2014, the Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCI) and the Project Monitoring Group (PMG) had together undertaken resolution of impediments for 296 projects with an estimated project cost of `6.6 trillion. As at end-March 2014 around 284 projects worth `15.6 trillion are under the consideration of PMG for which issues are yet to be resolved. Of\ufb01 cial data indicates that there has been a slight decline in the total number of delayed central sector infra-projects. However, 15-20 per cent of these projects, mostly in roads, power and petroleum, have reported additional delays, for which the dates of completion have been extended further. Also, there has been an increase in the number of projects without date of commissioning, mostly in roads re\ufb02 ecting the growing uncertainty about their completion. This suggests that it may take some more time before these clearances result in investment cycle turnaround. cost of ` 321 billion in Q2. This improvement was observed mainly in power and cement industries (Chart II.2). Aggregate sales growth (y-o-y) of large companies decelerated in Q3 II.11 Aggregate sales growth of a sample of 2,378 common companies decelerated to 5.1 per cent (y-o-y) in Q3 of 2013-14 after an upturn to 7.6 per cent in Q2 from 3.3 per cent in the preceding quarter. The deceleration was observed across the manufacturing and services sector, including the IT sector. However, due to lower growth in expenditure relative to sales, operating pro\ufb01 ts turned around with a positive growth of 6.5 per cent in Q3 against contraction observed in the previous quarter. Pro\ufb01 t margins have also improved. While \ufb01 scal targets were met in 2013-14 (RE), the quality of fiscal adjustment needs improvement Corporate investment intentions improved in Q3 II.10 Corporate investment intentions improved in Q3 of 2013-14 compared to that in the previous quarter as 179 new large projects with an envisaged cost of `791 billion received \ufb01 nancial assistance during the quarter, compared with 116 projects with an envisaged II.12 All key de\ufb01 cits, with the exception of effective revenue de\ufb01 cit, have turned out to be lower in 2013-14 revised estimates (RE) than the budget estimates (BE) in absolute terms. In terms of GDP, while the revenue de\ufb01 cit of 3.3 per cent remained unchanged from the BE, gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit (GFD) and primary de\ufb01 cit (PD) were lower by 0.2 percentage points each, at 4.6 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. During 2014-15, the gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit-GDP ratio is budgeted to decline by 0.5 percentage points to 4.1 per cent, which will be in line with the stipulated minimum reduction under the amended FRBM rules. II.13 In 2013-14 (RE), gross tax revenues recorded a shortfall of around 6.2 per cent over the budgeted level, mainly on account of lower collections under indirect taxes which were affected by the industrial slowdown, deceleration in service sector growth and lower imports. Non-tax revenues, on the other hand, exceeded budgetary targets primarily on account of higher dividend receipts, some of them being ad hoc in nature, from various public sector enterprises and public sector banks. Non-debt capital receipts during 2013- 14 (RE) fell short of budgetary targets, re\ufb02 ecting lower than expected receipts from disinvestment. II.14 The shortfall in achieving the budgeted receipts under tax revenue and disinvestment proceeds was more than offset by a sharp cutback in plan expenditure, particularly on the revenue account. Non-plan expenditure stayed marginally higher than the BE, with the overshooting curtailed by a cut in non-plan spending under the \ufb01 scal austerity drive that offset a large part of the sharp increase in expenditure on major subsidies. However, while \ufb01 scal consolidation was evident in 2013- 14 (RE), improvement in its quality is needed. II.15 A more prudent \ufb01 scal regime based on accrual accounting may go a long way in improving \ufb01 scal transparency. Also, considering that one-off increases in non-tax revenues such as spectrum auctions are unlikely to sustain and the subsidy often tends to overshoot budgetary provisions, further curtailment of subsidies through appropriate price adjustments and better targeting of major subsidies is necessary to improve the quality of \ufb01 scal consolidation. There is also a need to cost out growing entitlements, since the full cost of a programme is rarely seen in the initial years. Food price corrections moderate in\ufb02 ationary pressures III.2 Food and beverages group, which has an overall weight of 47.6 per cent in CPI- Combined, had contributed signi\ufb01 cantly to overall CPI in\ufb02 ation during April 2012 to December 2013. Inflation in this segment stayed in double digits during this period before declining markedly from 14.7 per cent in November 2013 to 8.6 per cent in February 2014 mainly due to 34.2 per cent fall in the vegetable price index and 3.1 per cent decline in the price of sugar. The y-o-y in\ufb02 ation also eased marginally for transport and communication and housing sub-groups during February 2014, though the index increased on a month-over-month basis. The disin\ufb02 ation momentum was strong in the case of headline CPI while CPI excluding food and fuel remained sticky. This is evident from the trends in month-over-month seasonally adjusted annualised rates (M-o-M SAAR) (Chart III.2). III.1 CPI in\ufb02 ation declined to 8.1 per cent in February 2014 (a 25-month low) from 11.2 per cent in November 2013, mainly due to declining vegetable prices during this three-month period (Chart III.1). Apart from vegetables, CPI in\ufb02 ation in \u2018cereals and products\u2019 posted a signi\ufb01 cant decline at 9.9 per cent in February 2014 from 12 per cent in November 2013. However, the pace of decline may come off as vegetable prices appear to have run their course of seasonal correction. III.3 Both the build-up of in\ufb02 ation during April to November 2013 and the subsequent fall in inflation during December 2013 to February 2014 was driven by food prices (Table III.1). Apart from vegetables, prices also moderated in the case of sugar and edible oils. Global sugar and edible oil prices have been declining in recent months, but for a marginal pick-up in February 2014, which provided some comfort. Chart III.3: Persistence of CPI excluding food and fuel in\ufb02 ation Clothing, bedding & footwear 3 1 - r p A 3 1 - g u A Note: Others include price of services paid to barbers, beauticians, washermen, tailors and iron-men. Wage price spiral pushed up in\ufb02 ation in the services segment III.4 CPI in\ufb02 ation, excluding food and fuel, remained high and persistent at 8.0 per cent in February 2014 as compared with 8.1 per cent in January 2014. The persistence was on account of pressures from housing, transport and communication and services led components such as medical care, education and stationery, household requisites and others (Chart III.3). High in\ufb02 ation with respect to CPI services re\ufb02 ected the role of wage pressures and other second round effects. The disaggregated CPI data also suggest that most of the items grew in a band of 6-8 per cent, while the \u2018others\u2019 sub- category, which includes charges paid to barbers, beauticians, washer-men, tailors and iron-men, grew at more than 10 per cent. In\ufb02 ation in the housing sub-group declined marginally below 10 per cent in February 2014 for the \ufb01 rst time after the in\ufb02 ation numbers based on the new CPI became available from January 2012. WPI in\ufb02 ation moderates signi\ufb01 cantly, but fuel in\ufb02 ation remains high In\ufb02 ation as per the Wholesale Price III.5 Index (WPI) also recorded a signi\ufb01 cant fall to 4.7 per cent in February 2014 from 7.5 per cent in November 2013. While disinflationary impulses were led by food prices, non-food manufactured products in\ufb02 ation edged up a bit to 3.1 per cent in February 2014 after ranging between 2.2-2.6 per cent during May-September 2013. This was mainly due to cost push pressures from exchange rate pass-through during July-September and upward price revisions in paper and paper products, chemical and chemical products and basic metals and alloys. Food, beverages and tobacco Fuel and light Housing Clothing, bedding and footwear Miscellaneous Overall CPI 4.1 0.7 2.1 2.1 1.3 -1.4 III.6 Suppressed inflation in the energy segment has been substantially passed through by now, though some more adjustment will be necessary in 2014-15 especially in diesel, gas and electricity that can still keep fuel in\ufb02 ation high. Despite moderate pressures from movements in global crude oil prices, WPI in\ufb02 ation in the fuel group continued to be high on account of staggered administered price revisions in the fuel segment (Chart III.4). In the longer run, however, the full pass through of the fuel price to the consumer may as well in\ufb02 ation has been sticky at around 8 per cent. The course of the CPI in\ufb02 ation will hinge on the strength of disin\ufb02 ationary impulses from policy actions, extent of the negative output gap and movements in food prices. CAD improves, driven mainly by declining imports result in lower inflation as demand is not arti\ufb01 cially supported. The release of suppressed inflation also provided some respite to the under-recoveries of oil marketing companies (OMCs). Despite this, the OMCs are currently (effective March 16, 2014) incurring a daily under-recovery of `4 billion on the sale of diesel, PDS kerosene and domestic LPG. Headline inflation has moderated in recent months, but upside risks remain in 2014-15 III.7 Pressures to CPI in\ufb02 ation in the recent past emanated from high and volatile food prices, which showed correction along with seasonal moderation in January-February 2014. The latest data from the Price Monitoring Cell of the Department of Consumer Affairs indicate that the seasonal correction has more or less played out. The Reserve Bank\u2019s regional price monitoring information also suggests some uptick in prices of vegetable and fruits, especially in the wholesale market. Going forward, in\ufb02 ation may moderate in the context of relatively stable crude oil and range-bound global commodity prices next year. On the other hand, food in\ufb02 ation will depend on the onset and spatial and temporal distribution of the south-west monsoon. The timing and magnitude of revisions in administered prices, particularly electricity and coal, will also affect the trajectory of in\ufb02 ation in 2014-15. However, in the excluding food and fuel segment, retail IV.1 External sector risks have been decidedly lowered, allowing monetary policy to focus on its core job of lowering in\ufb02 ation and supporting growth subject to disin\ufb02 ation. The narrowing of the CAD in 2013-14 followed a lower trade de\ufb01 cit due to higher exports as well as moderation in imports. IV.2 With a gradual recovery in key partner economies, India\u2019s exports began to improve in July 2013; this was also helped by a depreciation of the rupee. However, export growth momentum recorded during July- October could not sustain thereafter. Export growth began to decelerate in November 2013 and eventually turned negative in February 2014. Slowdown in exports in recent months can be attributed to certain sector speci\ufb01 c issues and global factors. For instance, 7.1 per cent decline in exports of gems and jewellery during 2013-14 (April-February) could be largely re\ufb02 ective of the price effect (estimated at (-)4.2 per cent) mainly emanating from an 20.1 per cent y-o-y drop in gold prices. Fall in exports of petroleum products are largely attributed to lower gross re\ufb01 ning margins in 2013-14 compared with previous year, even though re\ufb01 ning margins improved somewhat in Q4 of 2013-14. Destination-wise, while export demand from economies like the US and China was broadly intact during November 2013 to January 2014, a signi\ufb01 cant decline was evident in exports to EU economies, Switzerland, the OPEC region, Singapore and Hong Kong SAR (Chart IV.1). Going forward, with a likely improvement in global growth prospects, export growth is likely to recover in 2014-15. IV.3 Imports continued to contract for the ninth successive month, with a sixth straight month of double digit decline. The decline in imports was primarily due to sharp moderation in gold imports since July 2013. India\u2019s import bill for POL also remained largely contained re\ufb02 ecting broadly stable international crude oil prices (average Indian basket) and only a marginal increase in the quantum of oil imports. Although the decline in imports bodes well from the perspective of a CAD decline, the lowering of CAD on this account may not sustain with the expected revival of domestic aggregate demand. IV.4 Overall, India\u2019s trade de\ufb01 cit at US$ 128 billion during April-February 2013-14 was about 29 per cent lower than that of US$ 180 billion during April-February 2012-13. The CAD-GDP ratio in Q3 of 2013-14 narrowed to 0.9 per cent from 6.5 per cent in Q3 of 2012-13 and 1.2 per cent of GDP in Q2 of 2013-14. CAD in 2013-14 is expected to be around 2 per cent of GDP. With revival of capital \ufb02 ows and lower CAD, concerns about the \ufb01 nancing of latter have eased during H2 of 2013-14 (Chart IV.2). subsequent months. The Reserve Bank\u2019s swap windows for banks\u2019 mobilisation of fresh FCNR(B) deposits and overseas borrowing helped to build up reserves during September- November 2013. With the revival of portfolio flows since December 2013, India\u2019s forex reserves reached US$ 298.6 billion as on March 21, 2014, an accretion of US$ 23.1 billion over end-August 2013. IV.6 With a lower CAD and build-up of foreign exchange reserves, the downward pressure on the currency and the volatility in the Indian rupee began to subside. The rupee has also moved in a narrow range of `60.10 to `62.99 per US dollar since end-November 2013 (up to March 28, 2014). In fact, during this period the rupee fared better than most of other Surge in capital in\ufb02 ows led to accretion of reserves; the rupee has moved in a narrow range since end-November 2013 IV.5 Various measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank since September 2013 augured well for the resumption of capital in\ufb02 ows in emerging market currencies. With higher reserves and lower imports, the import cover as at end-December 2013 improved to 7.3 months from 6.6 months as at end-September 2013. IV.7 In terms of real exchange rates, the 6-currency and 36-currency trade weighted REER as on March 21, 2014 showed a depreciation of 8.2 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively over March 2013. However, the 6-currency and 36-currency trade weighted REER, computed on the basis of new CPI index, show a lower depreciation of 7.3 per cent and 3.6 per cent, respectively. External sector risks mitigated, but structural adjustments needed for export competitiveness India\u2019s external sector at this juncture IV.8 is more resilient compared to the post \u2013 May 22, 2013 period. A sharp decline in CAD in Q2 and Q3 helped in mitigating external sector vulnerabilities. Further, the increase in foreign exchange reserves has enhanced India\u2019s capacity to withstand spillovers from the global economy. In order to ensure that the CAD stays within sustainable level over the medium term, policy efforts should continue to focus on addressing sector specific issues affecting export performance, reducing the savings- investment imbalance by lowering in\ufb02 ation expectations to support private savings in \ufb01 nancial assets rather than gold, and structural reforms including fiscal consolidation. Notwithstanding the favourable developments so far, the unanticipated pace of tapering and the political risk surrounding the April-May 2014 general elections call for careful monitoring and appropriate policy measures. A 25 bps hike in policy rate undertaken in January to secure economy on disin\ufb02 ationary path V.1 The Reserve Bank in its Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy on January 28, 2014, hiked the repo rate by 25 bps to 8 per cent on account of upside risks to in\ufb02 ation, to anchor in\ufb02 ation expectation and to contain second round effects (Chart V.1). The move was intended to set the economy securely on the disin\ufb02 ationary path as recommended by the Urjit Patel Committee. End-March pressures keep liquidity tight; RBI announces additional term repos V.2 Frictional pressures arising from elevated central government cash balances with the Reserve Bank and a rise in currency in circulation contributed to tight liquidity conditions in the \ufb01 rst half of February 2014. However, on the back of signi\ufb01 cant drawdown in the government\u2019s cash balances post the \u2018Vote on Account\u2019 presentation on February 17, 2014, and the injection of additional liquidity through term repos, the strains on liquidity eased. V.3 This was reflected in the under- utilisation of the limit under the overnight LAF and reduced borrowings under MSF. The daily recourse to LAF (including term repo and MSF) declined from around `1.3 trillion in mid- February to `0.9 trillion in early March 2014. Narrowing of the wedge between credit and deposit growth also contributed to a reduction in the liquidity de\ufb01 cit. To manage evolving liquidity pressures, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity of about `95 billion through OMO outright purchase auction during Q4 of 2013-14, in addition to providing liquidity through overnight repo, MSF and term repos. V.4 However, liquidity conditions tightened from mid-March 2014 on the back of advance tax out\ufb02 ows. In order to address the anticipated tightening in liquidity conditions and with a view to providing \ufb02 exibility to the banking system in its liquidity management towards end-March, the Reserve Bank announced term repos of various tenors in March 2014. Besides, it extended the MSF facility on March 29 and 31, 2014, both being holidays, to facilitate annual closing of accounts. V.5 During 2013-14, net liquidity to the tune of about `520 billion has been injected through outright OMOs, besides an average daily net liquidity injection of `906 billion through LAF, MSF and term repos and `294 billion through export credit re\ufb01 nance (ECR). During Q4, an average `1.1 trillion has been injected on a daily basis via LAF, MSF and term repos and `397 billion through ECR. Pick-up in currency and domestic assets support growth in monetary indicators In line with the domestic liquidity V.6 situation, reserve money increased by `313 billion in Q4 of 2013-14 driven by currency in circulation on the components side and net domestic assets, in particular net credit to the centre, on the sources side. Money supply growth (M3) has averaged 14.5 per cent (y-o-y) in Q4 (up to March 7, 2014), the same as in Q3. The pick-up in deposit mobilisation, led by a spike in FCNR(B) deposits in Q3, has since moderated to average 15 per cent (y-o-y). On the sources side, the credit off-take decelerated to average 14 per cent (y-o-y), thereby narrowing the wedge between credit and deposit growth. Deployment of credit to industries V.7 moderated in 2013-14, even as credit to agriculture and allied activities, services and personal loans picked up. Within industries, sectors such as food processing, construction, leather, rubber, glass and paper witnessed a pick-up during April-February 2014. Deposit and lending rates remain sticky V.8 Due to exchange market pressures, the Reserve Bank took exceptional measures in Q2 of 2013-14. Consequently, both deposit and lending rates \ufb01 rmed up by September 2013. With the ebbing of pressures on exchange rate, the Reserve Bank rolled back exceptional measures in a calibrated manner and, therefore, lending rates softened a bit in H2 of 2013-14. On balance, while lending rates were by and large sticky during the year, the median deposit rate of SCBs rose by 35 bps over the year, although it remained almost unchanged in the second half (Table V.1). Table V.1: Deposit and lending rates of SCBs (excluding RRBs) 1. Domestic Deposit Rate (All tenor - Average) i) Public sector banks ii) Private sector banks iii) Foreign banks i) Public sector banks ii) Private sector banks iii) Foreign banks Median Base Rate of SCBs 3. Weighted Average Lending Rate (WALR) : Data pertain to March 25, 2014. #: Data on WALR pertain to February 2014. Note: Data on WALR are provisional. V.9 The factors impeding the pace of smooth monetary policy transmission to the credit market include rigidities in repricing for \ufb01 xed deposits, size of government borrowings, level of NPAs, high in\ufb02 ation and the signi\ufb01 cant presence of informal \ufb01 nance. In the presence of such structural rigidities in the credit market, the transmission of policy measures, particularly to the deposit and lending rates of banks, was relatively less pronounced as compared to money market rates. Volatility contained in domestic \ufb01 nancial markets amid renewed global spillovers V.10 Following a period of relative calm, the start of calendar year 2014 witnessed a brief spell of moderate global \ufb01 nancial market stress due to the escalation of con\ufb02 ict in Ukraine in February 2014. The announcement by the Fed of tapering by US$10 billion in January 2014 over and above a similar announcement in December witnessed renewed financial volatilities in most EMDEs. The US Fed again decided to taper its asset purchases by US$ 10 billion beginning April 2014 and signalled an earlier-than-expected start of the policy rate hike cycle, leading to bond yields hardening in the US. In the current environment, equities have become the preferred investment choice, as the low global rates have promoted a renewed search for yields (Chart V.2). V.11 India was able to withstand the bouts of spillovers much better than its peers in 2014 so far, having utilised the interim period to build buffers. Large debt in\ufb02 ows have occurred in 2014 so far with FII net investments in debt segment aggregating US$5.8 billion (till March 27). In recent weeks, equity \ufb02 ows have also picked up. Net FII investments in the equity segment aggregated US$3.2 billion during March so far, taking the total in 2014 so far to US$3.6 billion (till March 27). Equity market stages a recovery, yields stay \ufb01 rm V.12 Driven by expectations of a stable electoral outcome and a multitude of positives, including lower trade de\ufb01 cit numbers, lower inflation, an enthusiastic response to the telecom auction, incentives to certain sectors in the interim budget and a lower reported CAD, equity markets witnessed a modest rally with the BSE Sensex and NSE recording increases of about 6 per cent each during Q4 of 2013-14. Large equity in\ufb02 ows into India in recent weeks provided a boost to the rally (Chart V.3). However, primary capital markets continue to remain subdued. During Q4, G-sec yields witnessed V.13 two-way movements. The yields remained soft at the beginning of the quarter in anticipation of lower in\ufb02 ation numbers for December 2013. The policy rate hike in January 2014 resulted in hardening of yields. The yields remained capped after the primary auction deferred earlier was cancelled. The softer inflation numbers for January and February also supported the softening bias. The 10-year benchmark G-sec yield closed at 8.80 per cent at end-March 2014, marginally lower than at end-December 2013 (Chart V.4). Industrial Outlook Survey (http://www.rbi.org. in/IOS65) conducted during February-March 2014 reaf\ufb01 rmed that in terms of assessment, the Business Expectations Index improved in Q4 of 2013-14 as compared to the previous quarter. However, based on expectations, it moderated marginally for Q1 of 2014-15 (Chart VI.1). Consumer Con\ufb01 dence Index shows sign of improvement VI.2 The Reserve Bank\u2019s 16th round of the Consumer Con\ufb01 dence Survey (http://www.rbi. org.in/CCS16) conducted in February\u2013March 2014 showed an improvement in consumer con\ufb01 dence as indicated by the Current Situation Index (CSI) and Future Expectations Index (FEI) (Chart VI.2). Industrial Outlook Survey, after indicating improved con\ufb01 dence for Q4 of 2013-14, signal moderation for Q1 of 2014-15 VI.1 Various surveys conducted around January 2014 had indicated that business con\ufb01 dence improved signi\ufb01 cantly for Q4 of 2013-14. The Reserve Bank\u2019s 65th round of Professional forecasters anticipate modest recovery in 2014-15, in\ufb02 ation expected to go down2 VI.3 The Reserve Bank\u2019s 27th round of the Survey of Professional Forecasters outside the Reserve Bank (http://www.rbi.org.in/SPF27) showed that a modest recovery in 2014-15 is expected with growth at around 5.5 per cent. The expected CPI in\ufb02 ation for 2014-15 has been revised downwards to 8.0 per cent from 8.5 per cent in the previous round of the survey. Their forecast for CAD in 2014-15 is also now signi\ufb01 cantly lower at 2.4 per cent of GDP (Table VI.1). VI.4 The latest round (i.e. January-March 2014) of Inflation Expectations Survey of Households (IESH Round 35) (http://www.rbi. org.in/IESH35) indicates that the perception of three-month ahead and one-year ahead median in\ufb02 ation expectations of households moved down as compared with the previous quarter. The qualitative responses indicate that the proportion of respondents expecting price rise by \u2018more than current rate\u2019 has also decreased for both three-month ahead and one-year ahead period as compared with the previous quarter (Chart VI.3). Modest recovery likely to shape in 2014-15 VI.5 The outlook for the Indian economy has improved over the past two months with cautiously positive business sentiments, improved consumer con\ufb01 dence, expectations of a modest recovery in growth and decline in inflation expectations.

GDP growth at 4.7 per cent in Q3 of 2013-14, was slightly higher than that in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, but it has not been enough to suggest that the advanced estimates of 4.9 per cent during 2013-14 could be realised. The economy will now have to record a 5.5 per cent growth in Q4 to realise that growth, which on current assessment looks dif\ufb01 cult. VI.6 A moderate recovery is likely to set in 2014-15 broadly in line with the Reserve Bank\u2019s indicated projections in January 2014. However, data revisions for previous quarters and the consequent changes in base effects impart uncertainty to the growth trajectory ahead. The pace of recovery, nevertheless, is likely to be modest (Chart VI.4). The recovery is likely to be supported by investment activity picking up due to part resolution of stalled projects and improved business and consumer con\ufb01 dence. Manufacturing PMI, for the month of February 2014, touched a year\u2019s high on the back of higher output and new orders. The rural demand base is likely to shore up demand following record agricultural output. In addition, external demand is expected to improve further during 2014-15 stemming from encouraging prospects for global growth, notwithstanding some recent loss in export growth momentum. VI.7 Downside risks to growth have increased marginally since January 2014 taking into account the continued weak performance of industry and increase in risks to agriculture from the El Nino phenomenon, though the actual outcome on the monsoon depends on several other weather parameters. Tighter global \ufb01 nancial and monetary conditions, in addition to continued \ufb01 scal adjustment in some countries can also drag recovery. More importantly, if electoral outcomes fail to provide a stable government, the downside risks to growth could accentuate. To a large part, the recovery remains contingent on improvements in the investment climate. Disin\ufb02 ation proceeding on anticipated trajectory VI.8 Weak demand conditions kept global commodity price indices, for most of the primary commodities, well contained during 2013. In the baseline scenario, commodity prices are unlikely to increase signi\ufb01 cantly during 2014. The demand pressures are expected to remain muted against the backdrop of an expected gradual recovery in the advanced and emerging market economies and improved supplies. In the current scenario, global food and metal prices are likely to moderate. Brent crude oil spot prices averaged around US$ 108/ barrel (bbl) during Q4 of 2013-14. As per the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Brent crude oil price is projected to average at US$ 105/bbl and US$ 101/bbl in 2014 and 2015 respectively, thus imparting a mild softening bias. propensity to distort the underlying in\ufb02 ationary trajectory ahead. After some rise in the near months, headline in\ufb02 ation is expected to trend down aided by favourable base effects. It may bottom out in Q3 of 2014-15 before large adverse base effects and expected improved activity take in\ufb02 ation back to around the current levels (Chart VI.5). VI.9 Going forward, while the global commodity price scenario provides some comfort, the pace of deceleration in in\ufb02 ation may decline from what has been witnessed in recent months. This is because of the seasonal correction in vegetable prices likely having played itself out and supply-side responses remaining weak. In addition, signi\ufb01 cant month- to-month changes in base effect have a VI.10 Risks to inflation are more on the upside. They largely emanate from any adverse outcome on the monsoon, resurfacing of geopolitical risks that could lift commodity prices, sharper-than-anticipated tapering that could lead to exchange rate pass-through pressures and return of pricing power as the output gap narrows. ", "file17": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL);  reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks by 50 basis points from 23.0 per cent to 22.5 per cent of their NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning June 14, 2014;  reduce the liquidity provided under the export credit refinance (ECR) facility from 50 per cent of eligible export credit outstanding to 32 per cent with immediate effect;  introduce a special term repo facility of 0.25 per cent of NDTL to compensate fully for the reduction in access to liquidity under the ECR with immediate effect; and continue to provide liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. 2. Since the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement of April 2014, global activity is evolving at different speeds. A broad-based strengthening of growth is gaining traction in the US and the UK, after a moderation in the first quarter of 2014 due to adverse weather conditions. However, in the euro area, recovery is struggling to gather momentum. The pick-up in sales in Japan in anticipation of the consumption tax hike has been followed by a sharp fall in consumer spending. Growth in coming quarters will depend on all three \u201carrows\u201d being put in play. Structural constraints continue to impede growth prospects in emerging market economies (EMEs), with concerns about the slowdown in China as its economy rebalances. Financial markets across the world still remain vulnerable to news about the impending normalisation of interest rates in some developed economies, even as some valuations appear frothy. Lead indicators point to continuing sluggishness in domestic economic activity 3. in the first quarter of 2014-15. The outlook for agriculture is clouded by the meteorological department\u2019s forecasts of a delay in the onset of the south-west monsoon with a 60 per cent chance of the occurrence of El Nino. The ongoing contraction in the production of consumer durables and capital goods, coupled with moderation in corporate sales and non-oil non-gold imports, is indicative of continuing weakness in both consumption and investment demand. The decisive election result, together with improved sentiment should, however, create a conducive environment for comprehensive policy actions and a revival in aggregate demand as well as a gradual recovery of growth during the course of the year. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) increased for the 4. second consecutive month in April, pushed up by a sharp spike in food inflation, especially in the prices of fruits, vegetables, sugar, pulses and milk. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has moderated gradually since September 2013 although it is still elevated. 5. For the year 2013-14 as a whole, India\u2019s current account deficit (CAD) narrowed sharply to 1.7 per cent of GDP, primarily on account of a decline in gold imports, although other non-oil imports also contracted with the weakening of domestic demand, and there was some pick-up in exports. In April 2014, the trade deficit narrowed sharply due to resumption of export growth after two consecutive months of decline, and the ongoing shrinking of import demand. Robust inflows of portfolio investment, supported by foreign direct investment and external commercial borrowings, kept external financing conditions comfortable and helped add to reserves. 6. With the unwinding of year-end window dressing, the corresponding decline in the size of excess CRR holding of banks as well as the sharp decline in Government cash balances with the Reserve Bank as a result of Government expenditure, liquidity conditions improved significantly in April and May 2014. The average daily access to liquidity from the LAF and term repos during this period has been close to 1.0 per cent of NDTL. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor liquidity conditions and will actively manage liquidity to ensure adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors. In March and April, CPI headline inflation has risen on the back of a sharp 7. increase in food prices. Some of this price pressure will continue into May, but it is largely seasonal. Moreover, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has been edging down. The risks to the central forecast of 8 per cent CPI inflation by January 2015 remain broadly balanced. Upside risks in the form of a sub-normal/delayed monsoon on account of possible El Nino effects, geo-political tensions and their impact on fuel prices, and uncertainties surrounding the setting of administered prices appear at this stage to be balanced by the possibility of stronger Government action on food supply and better fiscal consolidation as well as the pass through of recent exchange rate appreciation. Accordingly, at this juncture, it is appropriate to leave the policy rate unchanged, and to allow the disinflationary effects of rate increases undertaken during September 2013-January 2014 to mitigate inflationary pressures in the economy. 8. The Reserve Bank remains committed to keeping the economy on a disinflationary course, taking CPI inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016. If the economy stays on this course, further policy tightening will not be warranted. On the other hand, if disinflation, adjusting for base effects, is faster than currently anticipated, it will provide headroom for an easing of the policy stance. 9. Contingent upon the desired inflation outcome, the April projection of real GDP growth from 4.7 per cent in 2013-14 to a range of 5 to 6 per cent in 2014-15 is retained with risks evenly balanced around the central estimate of 5.5 per cent (Chart 2). The outlook for the agricultural sector is contingent upon the timely arrival and spread of the monsoon. Easing of domestic supply bottlenecks and progress in the implementation of stalled projects should brighten the outlook for both manufacturing and services. The resumption of export growth is a positive development and as world trade gathers momentum, the prospects for exports should improve further. 10. In pursuance of the Dr. Urjit R. Patel Committee\u2019s recommendation to move away from sector-specific refinance towards a more generalised provision of system liquidity without preferential access to any particular sector or entity, the Reserve Bank has decided to limit access to export credit refinance while compensating fully with a commensurate expansion of the market\u2019s access to liquidity through a special term repo facility from the Reserve Bank (equivalent to 0.25 per cent of NDTL). This should improve access to liquidity from the Reserve Bank for the system as a whole without the procedural formalities relating to documentary evidence, authorisation and verification associated with the ECR. This should also improve the transmission of policy impulses across the interest rate spectrum and engender efficiency in cash/treasury management. 11. As the economy recovers, investment demand and the need for credit will pick up. To the extent that this contributes eventually to supply, it is important that banks have the room to finance it. A reduction in the required SLR will give banks more freedom to expand credit to the non-Government sector. However, the Reserve Bank is also cognisant of the significant on-going financing needs of the Government. Therefore, the SLR is reduced by 0.50 per cent of NDTL, with any further change dependent on the likely path of fiscal consolidation 12. With a view to improving the depth and liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market, it has been decided to allow foreign portfolio investors to participate in the domestic exchange traded currency derivatives market to the extent of their underlying exposures plus an additional US$ 10 million. Furthermore, it has also been decided to allow domestic entities similar access to the exchange traded currency derivatives market. Detailed operating guidelines will be issued separately. 13. As a prudential measure, the eligibility limit for foreign exchange remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) had been reduced to US$ 75,000 last year. In view of the recent stability in the foreign exchange market, it has been decided to enhance the eligible limit to US$ 125,000 without end use restrictions except for prohibited foreign exchange transactions such as margin trading, lottery and the like. Operating guidelines will be issued separately. 14. At present, only Indian residents are allowed to take Indian currency notes up to `10,000 out of the country. Non-residents visiting India are not permitted to take out any Indian currency notes while leaving the country. With a view to facilitating travel requirements of non-residents visiting India, it has been decided to allow all residents and non-residents except citizens of Pakistan and Bangladesh to take out Indian currency notes up to `25,000 while leaving the country. Operating guidelines in this regard are being issued separately. The third bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday, 15. August 5, 2014. ", "file18": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL);  reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks by 50 basis points from 22.5 per cent to 22.0 per cent of their NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning August 9, 2014; and continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. 2. Since the second bi-monthly monetary policy statement of June 2014, global economic activity has been picking up at a modest space from a sharp slowdown in Q1. Investor risk appetite has buoyed financial markets, partly drawing strength from assurances of continuing monetary policy support in industrial countries. Portfolio flows to emerging market economies (EMEs) have risen strongly. This implies, however, that EMEs remain vulnerable to changes in investor risk appetite driven by any reassessment of the future path of US monetary policy or possible escalation of geopolitical tensions. 3. Sentiment on domestic economic activity appears to be reviving, with incoming data suggesting a firming up of industrial growth and exports. The June round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey also points to improvement in business expectations in Q2. Leading indicators of the services sector are mixed, although there are early signs of modest strengthening of corporate sales and business flows. While the initial slow progress of the monsoon and its uneven spatial distribution raised serious concerns regarding agricultural production, these have been mitigated, though not entirely dispelled, by the pick-up in the monsoon through much of the country in July. The implementation of government policy actions that have been announced should create a congenial setting for a steady improvement in domestic demand and supply conditions. 4. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) has eased for the second consecutive month in June, with a broad-based moderation accompanied by deceleration in momentum. Higher prices of vegetables, fruits and protein-based food items were offset by the muted increase in the prices of non-food items, particularly those of household requisites and transport and communication. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel decelerated further, extending the decline that began in September 2013. However, with some continuing uncertainty about the path of the monsoon, it would be premature to conclude that future food inflation, and its spill- over to broader inflation, can be discounted. Liquidity conditions have remained broadly stable, barring episodic tightness 5. on account of movements in the cash balances of the Government maintained with the Reserve Bank. While the system\u2019s recourse to liquidity from the LAF, and regular and additional term repos has been around 1.0 per cent of the NDTL of banks, access to the MSF has been minimal and temporary. In order to manage transient liquidity pressures associated with tax outflows and sluggish spending by the Government, the Reserve Bank injected additional liquidity aggregating over ` 940 billion through nine special term repos of varying maturities during the months of June and July. Despite the reduction in the export credit refinance effected in early June, average utilisation of the facility has only been around 70 per cent of the available limit. The Reserve Bank will review existing liquidity arrangements and continue to monitor and manage liquidity to ensure adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors. 6. With the buoyancy in export performance sustained through Q1, the trade deficit has narrowed from its level a year ago. While oil imports rose in June partly on higher international crude prices, gold import growth picked up in response to some liberalization of import restrictions, and non-oil non-gold import growth has turned positive since May. Turning to external financing, all categories of capital flows have been buoyant. Surges in capital inflows in excess of the current account financing requirement and the repayment of swaps by oil marketing companies have bolstered international reserves. Policy Stance and Rationale 7. The moderation in CPI headline inflation for two consecutive months, despite the seasonal firming up of prices of fruits and vegetables since March, is due to both base effects and the steady deceleration in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. The recent fall in international crude prices, the benign outlook on global non-oil commodity prices and still-subdued corporate pricing power should all support continued disinflation, as should measures undertaken to improve food management. There are, however, upside risks also, in the form of the pass-through of administered price increases, continuing uncertainty over monsoon conditions and their impact on food production, possibly higher oil prices stemming from geo-political concerns and exchange rate movement, and strengthening growth in the face of continuing supply constraints. Accordingly, the upside risks to the target of ensuring CPI inflation at or below 8 per cent by January 2015 remain, although overall risks are more balanced than in June (Chart 1). It is, therefore, appropriate to continue maintaining a vigilant monetary policy stance as in June, while leaving the policy rate unchanged. 8. Prospects for reinvigoration of growth have improved modestly. The firming up of export growth should support manufacturing and service sector activity. If the recent pick-up in industrial activity is sustained in an environment conducive to the revival of investment and unlocking of stalled projects, with ongoing fiscal consolidation releasing resources for private enterprise, external demand picking up and international crude prices stabilising, the central estimate of real GDP growth of 5.5 per cent within a likely range of 5 to 6 per cent that was set out in the April projection for 2014-15 can be sustained. On the other hand, if risks relating to the global recovery, the monsoon and geo-political tensions intensify, the balance of risks could tilt to the downside (Chart 2). 9. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor inflation developments closely, and remains committed to the disinflationary path of taking CPI inflation to 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016. While inflation at around 8 per cent in early 2015 seems likely, it is critical that the disinflationary process is sustained over the medium-term. The balance of risks around the medium-term inflation path, and especially the target of 6 per cent by January 2016, are still to the upside, warranting a heightened state of policy preparedness to contain these risks if they materialise. In the months ahead, government actions on food management and to facilitate project completion should improve supply, but as consumer and business confidence pick up, aggregate demand will also strengthen. The Reserve Bank will act as necessary to ensure sustained disinflation. 10. In the second bi-monthly monetary policy statement of June 2014, the Reserve Bank reduced the SLR to 22.5 per cent of NDTL in anticipation of recovery in economic activity. With the Union Budget for 2014-15 renewing commitment to the medium-term fiscal consolidation roadmap and budgeting 4.1 per cent of GDP as the fiscal deficit for the year, space has opened up further for banks to expand credit to the productive sectors in response to its financing needs as growth picks up. Accordingly, the SLR is reduced by a further 0.5 per cent of NDTL. 11. In consonance with the calibrated reduction in the SLR, it is necessary to enhance liquidity in the money and debt markets so that financial intermediation expands apace with a growing economy. Currently, banks are permitted to exceed the limit of 25 per cent of total investments under the held to maturity (HTM) category provided the excess comprises only SLR securities, and banks\u2019 total holdings of SLR securities in the HTM category is not more than 24.5 per cent of their NDTL as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight. In order to enable banks greater participation in financial markets, this ceiling is being brought down to 24 per cent of NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning August 9, 2014. The Reserve Bank has taken a number of steps to enhance efficiency, 12. increase entry, speed up resolution, and improve access to financial services, such as modified regulations on long term lending and borrowing, proposals for licensing payment banks and small banks, a framework to deal with stressed assets, actions to further the use of mobile phones in banking, and efforts to simplify know your customer (KYC) norms, among others. The Reserve Bank will continue to carry forward its banking sector reforms agenda. 13. September 30, 2014. The fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday, ", "file19": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.0 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL);  reduce the liquidity provided under the export credit refinance (ECR) facility from 32 per cent of eligible export credit outstanding to 15 per cent with effect from October 10, 2014; continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily one-day term repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 9.0 per cent. 2. Since the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement of August 2014, global activity has been recovering slowly from the setback in Q1 of 2014, on the back of strengthening consumer spending and gradually improving labour market conditions in advanced economies (AEs) like the United States. However, the Euro area, where growth has stalled in the core economies, continues to be weak. Major emerging market economies (EMEs) continue to struggle with tepid domestic demand and headwinds from structural impediments. With monetary policy in AEs remaining highly accommodative, investor risk appetite has increased and spread to various asset classes. With volatility perhaps excessively low, financial markets have risen to new highs, driving surges of capital flows to EMEs. Apart from concerns about a sudden correction in financial markets if investors misread the timing of a reversal of the US monetary policy stance or if geopolitical tensions intensify, some downside risks to growth also persist, such as a possible further slowdown in the Euro area. 3. Domestic activity appears to have come off somewhat after the stronger-than- expected upturn in Q1 of 2014-15. In Q2, the growth of industrial production slumped in July, as capital goods production followed consumer durables into contraction. Exports cushioned the fall in manufacturing output, with the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey indicating expansion in export orders. Rainfall from the south west monsoon, now expected to be about 12 per cent deficient, will weigh on the kharif crop, mainly due to its uneven spatial distribution. This has resulted in drought-like conditions in some major production zones in the north-west region but also floods in the northern and eastern regions. In the services sector, constituents are moving at varying speeds and the purchasing managers\u2019 index points to uncertainty around future prospects. The recent cautious optimism that is building in the economy on the back of improved business sentiment needs to be placed on solid foundations through a step-up in investment. In this context, the resumption of stalled projects should provide a boost to inventory and capex cycles, while reducing distressed bank loans and revitalising growth. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) came off the 4. vegetable prices-driven spike in July 2014 and eased in all major groups barring food. Large and persistent upside pressures on food prices have resulted in their contribution rising to almost 60 per cent of headline inflation in August. The full impact of the skewed rainfall distribution carries risks to the future path of food inflation, though vegetable prices have fallen recently after the recent spike. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel decelerated to its lowest level in the new series, mainly on account of sharp disinflation in transport and communication and household requisites. Future food prices and the timing and magnitude of held back administered price revisions impart some uncertainty to an otherwise improving inflation outlook, where lower oil prices, a relatively stable currency, and a negative output gap continue to put downward pressure. Base effects will also temper inflation in the next few months only to reverse towards the end of the year. The Reserve Bank will look through base effects. Liquidity conditions have remained broadly balanced through Q2 of 2014-15, 5. except for transient tightness in the second half of July and early August due to delayed Government expenditure. Thereafter, as these expenditures began to flow, liquidity conditions eased. With credit growth falling well below deposit growth in August and September, structural sources of liquidity pressures also eased. The average recourse to liquidity from the Reserve Bank, measured by daily net liquidity injection through LAF, term repo and MSF, decreased from `870 billion in July to `795 billion during August and further to `450 billion during September so far (up to September 28). The Reserve Bank revised its liquidity management framework with effect from September 5, 2014, with more frequent 14-day term repos and daily overnight variable rate repo operations, to ensure flexibility, transparency and predictability in liquidity management operations. 6. Non-food credit growth decelerated in September 2014, the lowest level since June 2001, despite liquidity conditions remaining comfortable and deposit growth remaining normal. Partly, this sharp deceleration is on account of a high base \u2013 monetary tightening to curb the exchange market pressures in July-September last year raised interest rates on alternative sources of funds and pushed up the demand for credit from the banking system. Adjusting for these base effects, non-food credit growth would have been around 11 per cent in September 2014. Corporates have also opted to raise financing through alternative sources such as commercial paper, which are significantly larger than a year ago. Finance from other non-bank sources such as foreign direct investment and external commercial borrowing has also increased. Also, a few banks have sold stressed loans to asset reconstruction companies, and so these loans no longer appear as bank credit. Net bank credit is also lower because of repayments of loans by entities that have received payments by government departments and public enterprises, and because oil marketing companies\u2019 borrowing is lower. Finally, the slowdown in credit growth is more pronounced in public sector banks, but how much of this is because of needed bank balance sheet restructuring, repayments of stressed loans, or increased risk aversion is to be established. Going forward, as the investment cycle gathers momentum and overall demand picks up, banks will need to prepare to meet financing requirements as the credit cycle also turns. Equally, given the easy availability of foreign finance, corporations should be wary of being lulled by relative exchange rate stability and neglect to hedge foreign exchange liabilities. Incoming data suggest that the current account deficit, placed at 1.7 per cent 7. of GDP for Q1 of 2014-15 may remain contained in Q2. Over April-August 2014, the trade deficit was narrower than a year ago, notwithstanding a slowdown in export growth in July and August and a strengthening of non-oil non-gold import growth to its highest level since March 2013. The improvement in the trade balance has benefited from the fall in the value of gold imports. Even as the external financing requirement stays moderate, all categories of capital flows remain buoyant. As a result, there has been an accretion to international reserves, even though reserves denominated in US dollars have moderated somewhat in recent weeks, largely because of the strength of the US dollar. Since June, headline inflation has ebbed to levels which are consistent with 8. the desired near-term glide path of disinflation -- 8 per cent by January 2015. The most heartening feature has been the steady decline in inflation excluding food and fuel, by a cumulative 111 basis points since January 2014, to a new low. With international crude prices softening and relative stability in the foreign exchange market, some upside risks to inflation are receding. Yet, there are risks from food price shocks as the full effects of the monsoon\u2019s passage unfold, and from geo- political developments that could materialise rapidly. 9. For the near-term objective, therefore, the risks around the baseline path of inflation are broadly balanced, though with a slant to the downside (Chart 1). However, the undershooting of the objective may be temporary because of base effects. Turning to the medium-term objective (6 per cent by January 2016) the balance of risks is still to the upside, though somewhat lower than in the last policy statement. This continues to warrant policy preparedness to contain pressures if the risks materialise. Therefore, the future policy stance will be influenced by the Reserve Bank\u2019s projections of inflation relative to the medium term objective (6 per cent by January 2016), while being contingent on incoming data. 10. The momentum of activity in all sectors of the economy is yet to stabilize. Agriculture should shed the effects of recent shocks and pick up in Q4 of 2014-15. Industrial activity will await improvement in the business environment and the resumption of consumption and investment demand before gaining sustained speed. Post-monsoon revival in construction activity and the likely strengthening of momentum in business and financial services should sustain the recent signs of expansion in the services sector. The key to a turnaround in the growth path of the economy in the second half of the year is a revival in investment activity \u2013 in greenfield as well as brownfield stalled projects \u2013 supported by fiscal consolidation, stronger export performance and sustained disinflation. With expectations of these conditions remaining broadly unchanged, the projection of growth for 2014-15 is retained at 5.5 per cent within a range of 5 to 6 per cent around this central estimate. The quarterly growth path may slow mildly in Q2 and Q3 before recovering in Q4. 11. With liquidity conditions easing, the recourse to ECR has fallen off substantially to about 10 per cent of the outstanding export credit eligible for refinance. Accordingly, in pursuance of the Dr. Urjit R. Patel Committee\u2019s recommendation to move away from sector-specific refinance, the access to the ECR is being brought down to 15 per cent of the eligible export credit, thus continuing to give banks room for manoeuvre. This will be in effect from October 10, 2014. 12. December 2, 2014. The fifth bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on Tuesday, 13. This part of the Statement reviews the progress on various developmental and regulatory policy measures announced by the Reserve Bank in recent policy statements and also sets out new measures. 14. Developmental and regulatory measures are being put in place within the organising framework of the five-pillar approach announced in October 2013 in the Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2013-14. This approach emphasises the strengthening of the monetary policy framework; fortifying the banking structure; broadening and deepening financial markets; expanding access to finance; and dealing with stress in corporate and financial assets and putting them back to work. 15. Efforts to improve the monetary policy framework are documented in Part A of this Statement and in the accompanying Monetary Policy Report. In continuation of the process of implementing recommendations of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework (Chairman: Dr. Urjit R Patel), the first issue of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Report is being placed in the public domain along with this Statement. Steps have also been taken to refine the liquidity management framework with a view to making it flexible, transparent and predictable. Banking and Financial Structure 16. comprising: The approach to strengthening the financial structure has been multi-pronged, an expansion of participation and competition in the financial system; building counter-cyclical capital and liquidity buffers compliant with Basel III standards; and  refining and enhancing the efficacy of the regulatory and supervisory framework. 17. Turning to expanding the banking space, draft guidelines on Small Banks and Payments Banks as differentiated or restricted banks were placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website on July 17, 2014. Based on the feedback received:  final guidelines on licensing of these banks will be issued by end- November 2014. 18. With regard to non-banking financial companies(NBFCs): changes in the regulatory framework for NBFCs will be introduced by end- October 2014 covering prudential regulations on core capital, asset classification and provisioning norms, regulation on deposit acceptance, corporate governance and consumer protection measures. With these changes coming into force, the Reserve Bank will recommence registering new NBFCs. 19. Pursuant to the guidelines issued on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) in June 2014 which permitted banks to reckon government securities to the extent allowed by the Reserve Bank under its marginal standing facility as Level 1 High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the LCR, banks will be allowed to:  include government securities held by them up to another 5 per cent of their NDTL within the mandatory SLR requirement as level 1 HQLA in order to facilitate their meeting the LCR requirement while retaining the prudential aspect of the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR). This additional liquidity up to 5 per cent of NDTL will be available, in addition to the MSF, through a special facility and at a rate higher than the MSF rate as decided by the Reserve Bank taking into account the market conditions; and such government securities reckoned for the LCR should be valued at an amount no greater than their current market value as HQLAs are required to be taken at their market value for the purpose of computing the LCR. Detailed guidelines will be issued by mid-November 2014. To carry forward regulatory and supervisory initiatives,  final guidelines for monitoring tools for intra-day liquidity management will be issued in October 2014, consistent with the quantitative tools finalised by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS);  revised guidelines on a leverage ratio (LR) framework and attendant disclosure requirements, drawing on the BCBS\u2019s January 2014 paper, will also be issued by end-October 2014 so as to enable public disclosure of the LR by January 1, 2015; and a discussion paper will be issued by end-November on large exposures and convergence of exposure limits applicable in India with those of the BCBS which come into effect from January 1, 2019. 21. An Early Warning System (EWS) is being put in place to track banks\u2019 critical financial parameters. Deviations from pre-defined benchmarks would trigger more granular oversight in the form of enhanced off-site monitoring, focused discussions, on-site examination and punitive action, if warranted. 22. Along with early detection mechanisms for frauds, a Central Fraud Registry is also proposed to be created simultaneously as a searchable centralised database for use by banks. 23. Guidelines for declaring borrowers as \u201cnon-co-operative\u201d will be put out by end-October 2014. 24. As part of the Reserve Bank\u2019s continuous engagement in broadening and deepening financial markets, it has been decided to: allow access to the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) to scheduled urban co-operative banks (UCBs) in order to provide them an additional avenue for liquidity management, provided they fully comply with the eligible criteria prescribed for participation in the LAF including having current accounts and SGL accounts with Reserve Bank, Mumbai, the minimum bid size prescription and the like. Detailed guidelines will be issued separately by mid-October 2014. 25. liquidity, it has been decided to: In order to further develop the government securities market and enhance bring down the ceiling on SLR securities under the HTM category from 24 per cent of NDTL to 22 per cent in a graduated manner i.e. 23.5 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning January 10, 2015, 23.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning April 4, 2015, 22.5 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning July 11, 2015 and 22.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning September 19, 2015.  a. limit on short sale for liquid securities will be increased to 0.75 per cent of outstanding stock or `600 crore, whichever is lower (from 0.50 per cent of outstanding stock); short sale limit for illiquid securities is being retained at 0.25 per cent of the outstanding stock of securities; and b. banks and primary dealers (PDs) may be permitted to take short positions in government securities in the over-the-counter (OTC) market (within the total short sale limit), subject to appropriate audit/ internal controls. Detailed guidelines are being issued separately. 26. In April 2014, the Reserve Bank announced that it would examine the possibility of allowing limited re-repo/re-hypothecation of repoed government securities with the objective of developing the term repo/money market. In view of the growth of repo markets during the last decade and the availability of a robust trading, clearing and settlement infrastructure with a central counter-party (CCP) guarantee, it has been decided to: permit re-repo of Government securities subject to appropriate control measures and development of IT infrastructure. Detailed guidelines will be issued in consultation with all stakeholders by end- 27. long term foreign investors, it has been decided to: In order to address operational issues faced by foreign portfolio investors and provide extended reporting timings on trade date and an option for T+2 settlements for secondary market OTC trades in government securities for such investors. Detailed guidelines in this regard would be issued by end-November 2014. 28. With a view to easing operational conditions for hedging of foreign exchange risk by market participants, it has been decided to:  increase the eligible limit for importers under the past performance route to 100 per cent from the existing 50 per cent i.e., importers can hedge up to 100 per cent of the average of past three years\u2019 import turnover or the to preceding year\u2019s compliance with other conditions applicable for hedging under this route. is higher, subject 29. Expanding access of finance to the small, the poor, the unorganised and the underserved sections of society has been a central tenet of the Reserve Bank\u2019s developmental policies. 30. State-Level Coordination Committees (SLCCs) are being strengthened to focus on financial inclusion for flow of public savings to the formal channels and protection of public deposits mopped up by unauthorised and unscrupulous entities. In line with the recommendation of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC):  the SLCC, which is now chaired by State chief secretaries/ UT Administrators, will meet every quarter instead of half-yearly. 31. With a view to easing difficulties faced by common persons while opening bank accounts and during periodic updating, guidelines on \u2018know your customer\u2019 (KYC) will be further simplified with immediate effect so that banks: do not insist on physical presence of the customer at the time of periodic updating; do not seek fresh proof of identity and address at the time of periodic updating in case of no change in status for 'low risk' customers; allow self-certification; accept a certified copy of the document by mail/post, etc; and do not seek fresh documents if an existing KYC compliant customer of a bank desires to open another account in the bank. 32. There is a need for banks to complete KYC for all customers including long standing \u2018low risk\u2019 customers. Banks should complete documentation, while minimising the effort on the part of the customer to what is strictly needed. In the event that customers are unable to comply within a reasonable time period, \u2018partial freezing\u2019 may be introduced in respect of KYC non-compliant customers i.e., credits would be allowed in such accounts while debits would not be allowed, with an option to the account holder to close the account and take back the money in the account. 33. In line with its vision of migrating towards electronic payments and a \u2018less- cash\u2019 society, the Reserve Bank has been examining the feasibility of (a) standardisation in the operational processes and procedures involved in extension of mobile banking services, and (b) implementation of a pan-India bill payment system (recommended by GIRO Advisory Group (GAG)) facilitating anytime/anywhere payment of a variety of bills and dues. Similarly, the setting up and operationalisation of a system for uploading, accepting, discounting and settlement of the invoices/bills of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is also being envisaged to facilitate faster financing for such entities. In this connection, it has been decided to:  34. Customer protection is an integral element of the endeavour to expand access to finance. Accordingly, a draft Charter of Customer Rights under Consumer Protection regulations was placed on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website in August for comments from the public. For operationalising the Charter of Customer Rights: necessary instructions will be issued to the banks by the appropriate regulatory departments in the Reserve Bank shortly. 35. Criteria for inviting applications from entities eligible under the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEA-Fund) for registration will be issued on the Reserve Bank\u2019s website by the end of October 2014. 36. Looking ahead, the Reserve Bank\u2019s developmental and regulatory policies will continue to evolve within the five-pillar approach to build a competitive, vibrant and sound financial system that is geared to intermediating the financing needs of a growing economy. Efforts will be made to harness appropriate technology and ensure that financial services are available to all even as customer awareness and protection is reinforced. The Reserve Bank will continue to carry forward banking sector reforms by adapting the best international practices to country-specific requirements. Alpana Killawala Press Release : 2014-2015/672 Principal Chief General Manager ", "file20": "Economic activity gained pace in Q1 of 2014-15, but its momentum appears to have slackened in Q2. With the improvement in business confidence and congenial conditions for restarting investment demand, real GDP growth should pick up towards the close of the year, aided by a modestly firming global recovery supporting exports and the ongoing search for yields in international financial markets spurring capital inflows. Barring the impact of weather- related food supply disruptions, inflation has been moderating in a broad-based manner and is set to evolve around the expected trajectory through 2014-15. Elevated inflation expectations of households and risks from still-high input costs and sticky wages, however, present challenges to bringing down inflation to 6 per cent by January 2016 along the committed glide path. and have been rising since March, presumably affected With consumer price index (CPI) inflation easing from its recent peak of 11.2 per cent in November 2013, the near-term outlook for inflation has improved and the target of 8 per cent for January 2015 appears more within reach than at the time of the first bi-monthly monetary policy statement in April. Latest readings on sensitive components of food prices suggest that they may have peaked after monsoon related increases. The softening of international commodity prices, particularly crude oil, metals and chemicals, is feeding through into an abating of key input prices domestically. Wages, though still sticky, are decelerating, facilitating smaller increases in minimum support prices than in the past. Also, the stability in the exchange rate since January this year is entrenching the disinflation. Furthermore, the effects of past monetary policy tightening are operating through the slack in various segments of the economy to bring down inflation excluding food and fuel. Nevertheless, there are upside risks to inflation from the skewed spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon and from geo-political tensions which could jeopardise the near- term outlook if they materialise. inflation expectations for a year ahead also moved up after edging down since December 2013, and remain elevated relative to their long-run averages. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank also believe that median inflation may ease up to Q3 of 2014-15, but it is likely to firm up in Q4 (Chart I.2). Their long- term inflation expectations, however, appear to be on a gradually declining path. The industrial outlook survey of the Reserve Bank reflects a softening of manufacturers\u2019 expectations of input prices over the Expectations of various economic agents tracked by forward-looking surveys provide useful insights into wage and price formation and thereby into the evolution of inflation conditions. Households\u2019 three month ahead inflation expectations appear to have discounted recent favourable developments on the inflation front could lead to selling prices moderating going forward (Chart I.3). Taking into account the baseline assumptions (Table I.1), near-term forecasts drawn from structural models, with off-model judgmental adjustments reflecting information that is not explicitly modeled, suggest that average CPI headline inflation will be about 8 per cent in Q4 of 2014-15, with a 70 per cent confidence interval of 6.8 per cent to 9.2 per cent. Thus, the risks to the target of ensuring CPI inflation at or below 8 per cent by January 2015 remain broadly balanced (Chart I.4). The near-term month-wise evolution of the inflation trajectory suggests that inflation will ease from the current level of close to 8 per cent to about 6 per cent by November. With favourable base effects reversing in the following months (Box I.1), inflation is likely to climb back to around 8 per cent by January through March 2015. Model projections over a longer monetary policy horizon, i.e., up to March 2016, assuming unchanged Indian basket crude oil price at US$ 100 per barrel for the remaining part of the year. Exchange rate at about `60 per US$ for the remaining part of the year. macroeconomic policies and structural characteristics of the Indian economy, suggest that inflation will gradually ease to 7.0 per cent in Q4 of 2015-16 with a 70 per cent confidence interval of 4.6 per cent to 9.4 per cent. This indicates that the upside risks to the target of 6 per cent by January 2016 are significant, especially with economic activity and aggregate demand expected to pick up and structural improvements in food supply taking time to fructify. Real GDP growth surprised on the upside in Q1 of 2014-15, recording 5.7 per cent after remaining damped for eight consecutive quarters. On the supply side, the 12 per cent deficit in rainfall in the south west monsoon season as well as its uneven distribution and delayed Monetary policy authorities generally communicate their measurement of inflation, including the target(s) they set for it, in the form of year-on-year (y-o-y) changes i.e., the percentage change between the price index (p) relating to a given month over its value in the corresponding month a year ago. Thus, inflation or \u03c0 in a given month t is approximated as \u03c0t = [ln pt - ln pt-12]*100 where p is the price index and ln is the natural logarithm. Likewise, inflation in the preceding month is \u03c0t-1 = [ln pt-1 - ln pt-13]*100 and so on. or extreme changes in the price index (or sub-index) during the base period i.e., the period that is used as the basis for calculation of annual rates2. Forecasting y-o-y inflation thus involves two parts: (a) a good fix on base effects which is obtained from the momentum of inflation in the base period that is already known; and (b) projecting future momentum through time series techniques and structural models and converting them into price index values so that they can be expressed in y-o-y terms. Accountability in the conduct of monetary policy focused on price stability involves explaining to the public why inflation has moved up or down between one period and another. Arithmetically, the explanation of why \u03c0t-1 moved to \u03c0t consists of two parts: (1) why pt-1 moved to pt or the month-on-month change in the price index which is referred to as \u2018momentum\u20191; and (2) why pt-12 moved from pt-13 or the \u2018base effect\u2019. Short-term y-o-y inflation forecasts are fundamentally influenced by the base effect and, therefore, a good understanding of how and why inflation behaved in the base period is key to robust forecasts. Formally, the base effect has been defined as the contribution to changes in the annual rate of inflation from unusual The the year 2013-14 as well as 2014-15 so far is a good example of the interaction between momentum and base effects as reflected in the observed volatility of headline inflation. In June 2014, the sharp increases in prices of vegetables resulted in high momentum of headline price increases, but y-o-y inflation moved down because of a favourable base effect from even higher momentum in June 2013. By contrast, vegetable prices spiked further in July 2014 relative to the preceding month, pushing up momentum of headline inflation and more than offsetting the favourable base effect. Consequently, y-o-y headline inflation rose sharply in July 2014 in comparison with June 2014. In August 2014, with base effects overwhelming the headline price momentum, which had seen some moderation due to decline in the extent of month over month (m-o-m) increase in vegetable prices, year on year (y-o-y) inflation registered a decline from July to August 2014 (Chart I.B1). Going forward, favourable base effects are expected to dampen headline inflation over September- November 2014, aided by a moderation in momentum as vegetable prices come off their recent peak. The evolution of headline inflation during December 2014 -February 2015 will likely be significantly influenced by unfavourable base effects arising out of the sharp fall in m-o-m changes in prices during the base period. This, in spite of a possible subdued momentum obtained from a seasonal softening of vegetable prices, would result in an upturn in inflation during December 2014-February 2015. Monetary policy in disinflationary mode along with normal monsoons next year could then mute the momentum of headline inflation. The favourable base effects from high inflation in June-August 2014 could operate in conjunction to produce an easing inflation trajectory in the middle of 2015-16. 1 Usually seasonal adjustments are made in order to get a clear picture of the underlying trend that is not blurred by very short-run predictable changes related to seasonal effects as observed in say agricultural production or consumer spending and the like. Month-on-month changes are also usually annualised to get an annual rate assessment corresponding to the manner in which inflation is communicated. 2 European Central Bank (2005), \u201cBase Effects and their Impact on HICP Inflation in early 2005\u201d, ECB Monthly Bulletin, January, pp. 31-32. kharif sowing relative to a year ago will drag down agricultural growth, which is evident from the first advance estimates of kharif production. The sharp pick-up in industrial activity in Q1 has weakened thereafter, with decline in production of both consumer durables and capital goods. However, business sentiment is on an upswing as reflected in financial market conditions. Standard and Poor\u2019s have revised India\u2019s sovereign rating outlook from negative to stable, which should contribute to brightening the prospects for investment and capital flows. Constituents of the services sector are moving at different speeds. Construction activity should benefit from policy initiatives to boost affordable housing, investment in real estate, and refinancing of infrastructure projects coming back on-stream. Ahead of this recovery, bank credit to construction has been accelerating and should gain further momentum as efforts to improve credit disbursement support the revival of demand. On the other hand, financial and business services as well as social, community and personal services are unlikely to sustain the pace of expansion recorded in Q1 in view of sluggish banking activity and the expected fiscal consolidation. Turning to the demand side, gross fixed capital formation should build upon the robust upturn in Q1 as announced policy measures to boost investment take effect. External demand is gradually improving, suggesting better prospects for export growth in the second half of 2014-15. Although corporate sales seem to be pointing to modest strengthening of consumption, rural demand is being moderated by slowing growth in agriculture. Forward-looking indicators extracted from surveys of real activity conducted by the Reserve Bank as well as other agencies reflect cautious optimism on the near-term outlook for growth. While professional forecasters expect only a gradual pick-up in growth after some deceleration in the second half of 2014 (Chart I.5), business expectations of corporates surveyed by the Reserve Bank are at an eleven-quarter high in Q3 of 2014-15 (Chart I.6). This is also corroborated by surveys conducted by other agencies, which ascribed upbeat business sentiment to formation of a stable government at the centre and the greater certainty about the policy environment, improvement in twin deficits, buoyant foreign capital inflows, a stable exchange rate and improved financial market conditions (Table I.2). Consumer confidence is also reviving, with the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey indicating expectations one year ahead at their highest levels since the global financial crisis (Chart I.7). Model-based forecasts augmented with these forward-looking assessments indicate that the sharp pick-up in growth in Q1 of 2014-15 may not be sustained in Q2 and Q3 as the full impact of the 2015-16, real GDP growth is projected to rise to 6.3 per cent. monsoon deficiency plays out on agricultural activity, with spillovers to non-agricultural sectors through demand effects (Chart I.8). The outlook for services, and in particular, community, social and personal services is weak. For other categories of services a slow turnaround is expected in the second half of 2014- 15. Accordingly, prospects for reinvigoration of non- agricultural growth are expected to improve only gradually, gathering momentum in Q4 of 2014-15. Looking forward into 2015-16, the likely firming up of export growth and investment demand should support both manufacturing and service sector activity. Revival of stalled projects and the space created for private enterprise by ongoing fiscal consolidation should support a stronger step-up in the growth momentum in an environment of steady disinflation. The macroeconomic outlook is subject to risks from both global and domestic uncertainties. Risks from global adversities such as a slowdown in the pace of global recovery, financial market turbulence due to faster than expected tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies and hardening of commodity prices on geo-political tensions and/or weather-related supply disruptions could impact all emerging economies. On the other hand, domestic risks stem from a larger than expected negative impact of a skewed distribution of monsoon, inflationary impact of a stronger than expected improvement in domestic economic activity and exacerbation of exchange market pressures. The likely impact of these shocks on growth and inflation are assessed using a quarterly projection and policy analysis system. If global growth turns out to be weaker than projected in the July update of the IMF\u2019s World Economic Outlook, due to either a lasting impairment of potential output, or financial vulnerabilities resurfacing and undermining For 2014-15, real GDP growth is projected to lie between 5 per cent and 6 per cent, with a central estimate of 5.5 per cent. This projection remains unchanged from the April projection with a better than expected industrial growth compensating for the likely decline in agricultural growth. GDP growth for Q4 of 2014-15 is projected at 5.6 per cent with a 50 per cent confidence interval of 5.1 per cent to 6.1 per cent. For consumer confidence, or the effects of monetary policy tightening, or a combination thereof, external demand conditions facing India\u2019s exports could worsen, translating into a negative external shock for growth. A widening of slack in the global economy by 50 basis points would lead to a decline in India\u2019s GDP growth from the baseline by about 20 basis points in 2015-16 (Chart I.9). Domestic inflation would also soften by about 10 basis points below the baseline, largely reflecting the fall in global commodity prices in response to higher slack in the global economy and their pass-through to domestic inflation (Chart I.10). increase would have a minimal impact on GDP growth reflecting still low energy intensity of growth. As regards specific domestic shocks, the baseline trajectories of growth and inflation assume a normal monsoon in 2015-16 and moderate increases in minimum support prices. If these conditions are not realised, the shock to farm output, and through demand and input linkages to other sectors, could result in a decline in overall GDP growth by around 40 basis points below the baseline in 2015-16. This may lead to food price pressures persisting at the levels prevailing so far, pushing headline inflation by about 80 basis points above the baseline by the end of 2015-16. In the baseline, international crude prices are expected to gradually moderate through 2015 with alternate supply sources opening up amidst weak demand. Yet, a supply disruption induced imported inflation shock in the form of a 10 per cent increase in the price of the Indian basket of crude oil from the level assumed in the baseline could result in an increase in headline inflation by about 20 basis points above the baseline. The direct impact on domestic retail fuel prices will be reinforced by the second round impact on food, manufacturing and services prices. The crude oil price A favourable shock to the baseline inflation path could also be envisaged if the recent initiatives to address food supply bottlenecks fructify on an enduring basis, especially through improvements in the supply chain, reforms in market infrastructure and a step-up in investment in agriculture. This may result in GDP growth accelerating by about 40 basis points in 2015-16 over the baseline, and a faster fall in food price inflation leading to a decline in headline inflation by around 90 basis points below the baseline by the end of 2015-16. The future path of inflation could also be impacted by the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for growth. If real GDP growth turns out to be stronger by 100 basis points than expected in 2015-16, aggregate demand could rise sharply in the form of a pick-up in investment and consumer spending. This would result in a faster closing of the output gap, translating into higher underlying inflation and an increase in headline inflation by about 20 basis points above the baseline by the end of 2015-16. This relatively muted effect of a positive demand shock essentially reflects the initial conditions \u2013 the persisting slack in the economy. Another risk to the baseline inflation path is volatility in the exchange rate emanating either from global developments or a domestic demand shock. If the exchange rate depreciates by 10 per cent in 2015-16 below the baseline assumption, a rise in import costs would feed into higher input costs and over time, translate into higher output prices as firms pass on cost pressures. The direct and indirect impact of the exchange rate change would cause headline inflation to increase by about 30 basis points above the baseline. The deprecation of rupee may, however, provide some boost to exports, resulting in an increase in GDP growth by about 10 basis points. The macroeconomic outlook presented in this chapter is one of gradual disinflation with growth gaining some momentum from Q4 of 2014-15 and improvement in macro-balances (Table I.3). Near-term risks appear to be abating, but medium-term risks are still on the upside. The outlook draws upon the assessment of macroeconomic conditions presented in Chapter II to Chapter V.

The ebb of headline consumer price inflation through 2014-15 so far was interrupted by a spike in vegetable prices in July 2014 due to monsoon-induced supply disruptions. Excluding food and fuel, however, inflation has been declining, aided by the disinflationary stance of monetary policy. Headline inflation appears well aligned with the target of 8 per cent set for January 2015. As for costs, there are indications of some deceleration after a sustained period of high growth. In January 2014, the Reserve Bank formally adopted a glide path for disinflation in terms of headline consumer prices1, with milestones of 8 per cent by January 2015 and 6 per cent by January 2016. Drawing from the recommendations of the Expert Committee to Revise and Strengthen the Monetary Policy Framework (Chairman: Dr. Urjit R. Patel), this ushered in a fundamental regime shift in the conduct of monetary policy in India. The Reserve Bank anchored this change by tightening monetary policy in the January 2014 policy review and maintained this tight stance in subsequent policy reviews so as to set the economy firmly on the disinflation path. Since then, inflationary pressures have fallen in a broad- based manner. This has been aided by measures taken by the Government to control the fiscal deficit and to augment food supply, disincentivise agricultural exports and reform agricultural marketing policies. low and infrequent. Accordingly, headline inflation has fallen from 11.2 per cent in November 2013 to 7.8 per cent in August 2014 \u2013 within range of the target of 8 per cent for January 2015 (Chart II.1). Even as headline year-on-year inflation has been moderating, there was a sharp pick-up in month- on-month change in prices \u2013 or momentum \u2013 in July caused by sharp increases in food prices. The momentum, however, moderated in August (Chart II.2). The impact of higher momentum on the headline has been largely masked by favourable base effects. The magnitude of sequential increases in prices in CPI excluding food and fuel were also higher in June and July 2014, though it reversed in August. A marked feature of the years following the global financial crisis of 2008-09 has been the persistence of CPI inflation in India. While there has been a Inflation is ultimately determined by the stance of monetary policy, notwithstanding short-run disturbances emanating from sectoral price pressures. Reflecting the ongoing transmission of monetary policy impulses through the economy, inflation excluding food and fuel has declined from 8.5 per cent in September 2013 to 6.9 per cent in August 2014. Food inflation has also moderated in tandem from double digits to 9.2 per cent in August 2014, punctuated by sharp inclement weather-driven spikes. Fuel inflation has been steadily falling as administered increases in kerosene, cooking gas and coal prices have been held back while electricity price revisions have been 1 Unless stated otherwise, consumer prices are measured by the consumer price index (combined) base: 2010=100. downward correction in average headline inflation in the recent period beginning in January 2014 relative to 2012 and 2013, its inertia at elevated levels relative to tolerance thresholds warrants careful scrutiny of the sources of this persistence so as to break unidirectional expectations surrounding the inflation outlook (Chart II.3. and Box II.1). Recent changes in headline inflation are observed to be sensitive to the behaviour of some of its components, which appear to be moving in diverse directions and exerting differing pulls (Chart II.4). Analysis of the cross-sectional distribution of inflation assumes importance in this context to ascertain whether or not transitory elements are generating relative price changes which could be impacting aggregate price movements enduringly. In particular, India\u2019s inflation history shows that supply shocks tend to produce a positive skew to its distribution, with a few items pushing the average inflation up on a sustained basis. Headline CPI Inflation persistence is the tendency for shocks to push the inflation rate away from its steady state. Sources of inflation persistence have been identified as: (a) intrinsic persistence or backward-lookingness in price- setting behaviour; (b) extrinsic persistence arising out of the mark-up over costs; (c) expectations-based persistence emerging from the nature of inflation expectations; and (d) policy-driven persistence from monetary policy regime shifts. For a country like India which is exposed to a variety of shocks, this disaggregate approach assumes critical importance. Recent studies in the Indian context suggest that: (i) inflation persistence increased in the post-global crisis period; (ii) both intrinsic and extrinsic persistence declined while expectations-driven inflation persistence increased; (iii) both intrinsic and extrinsic inflation persistence have, however, remained high relative to the cross-country experience; and (iv) the increase in expectations-driven inflation persistence could be due to consumers\u2019 incomplete information on the nature of economic shocks and also unhinged credibility around the ability of macroeconomic policies to deliver low and stable inflation. effects propagating into prices of items other than food and resulting in a generalisation of inflation. Within the food group, cereals constitute about 15 per cent of the CPI but the sub-group\u2019s contribution to food inflation has declined over the preceding 12 months (Chart II.6). The group of protein-based items (eggs, fish, meat, milk and pulses), which has been experiencing persistent upside pressures, contributed about a sixth of overall inflation through 2014-15 so far. Fruits and vegetables have a share of merely 7 per cent in the index, but contributed about a fifth of headline inflation in July and August, and are marked by sharp spikes in prices. inflation has largely had a positive skew, indicating that relative price pressures may be contributing to the overall inflation persistence (Chart II.5). Food constitutes about 48 per cent of the CPI and has been the major source of upside pressures on retail inflation. Food price shocks have large and persistent effects on inflation expectations, with second-round Headline inflation is also vulnerable to shocks from fuel prices, typically emanating from administered price changes in response to international crude price movements. The category fuel and lighting accounts for 9.5 per cent of the CPI. Contribution to headline inflation from this category has been falling on account of inadequate administered price revisions. However, the large element of suppressed inflation in subsidised kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) warrants a precautionary monetary policy stance in the context of under-recoveries of oil marketing companies (OMCs) which may push up outgoes on subsidies (Table II.1). base effects (Chart II.7). The category of \u2018others\u2019 in the CPI covers a heterogeneous group of personal non-tradable services with annual price changes persistently in double digits barring June 2014. This suggests that wages have been imparting upside price pressures to these labour-intensive services and on an economy- wide basis, they can lead to the generalisation of inflationary pressures. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has been falling gradually since September 2013 in response to monetary policy actions, with favourable implications for the evolution of headline inflation. Within this category, housing2, contributing 11 per cent to headline inflation through 2014-15 so far, has been edging down with rentals easing in recent months. Inflation in respect of transport and communication \u2013 which mainly comprises petrol and transport fares \u2013 has experienced moderation since October 2013, largely reflecting the easing of international crude prices, stability in the exchange rate and favourable Other indicators of retail inflation such as consumer price (CPI-IW), agricultural labourers (CPI-AL) and rural labourers (CPI-RL) ebbed in Q1 of 2014-15 and moderated further in July-August 2014. Wholesale inflation measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) as also the indicator of economy-wide price trends \u2013 the GDP deflator \u2013 have decelerated (Table II.2). Cost pressures from both domestic and external sources have played a significant role in the co- existence of elevated inflation and a negative output gap, denting the efficacy of monetary policy in bringing inflation down to the desired extent. Supply bottlenecks in various sectors of the economy have imparted cost-push rigidities to the level and path of inflation. Imported inflation, mainly associated with the prices of crude petroleum, in 2014-15 so far, have eased. Combined with a stable exchange rate, market- determined prices of petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) could moderate. Furthermore, the staggered increases in the administered prices of diesel coupled / r e t r a u Q r o t a fl e d 2 CPI housing (in terms of rentals) is collected only in the urban areas. The weight of housing in the CPI-Urban index is 22.5 per cent and in CPI- Combined index is 9.8 per cent. Services sector input cost pressures are perceived by purchasing managers to be moderating from their recent peak in 2011. Weak pricing power is, however, preventing the pass-through of even these moderate increases into selling prices (Chart II.9). Trends in labour costs have to be assessed separately for both formal and informal sectors, given the dualistic character of the Indian labour market (Box II.2). Monetary policy has to be watchful about wage-price spirals posing risks to the disinflationary momentum. with softening of international crude oil prices have wiped out the diesel under-recovery of OMCs in September 2014. Costs of farm inputs have seen some deceleration in the last one year (Chart II.8). Industrial raw material cost pressures have been easing. The Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey indicates that fewer firms assessed that input prices went up in Q2 of 2014- 15 than in the corresponding quarter a year ago. At the same time, fewer firms expect increase in selling prices, reflecting perceptions of still weak pricing power (Table II.3). (Percentage responses) Inflationary pressures are expected to ease further in Q3 as the effects of weather-related food price shocks wane and the usual seasonal trough sets in. Cost pressures from both domestic and external sources are softening. The path of headline inflation in the coming months will be impacted by favourable base effects. As they dissipate from December onwards, headline inflation could turn up in the last quarter of 2014-15. Potential administered price revisions carry upside risks to the near-term inflation outlook. It is critical that these dynamics are carefully monitored to ensure that the disinflation momentum is sustained. Wages are a key determinant of the inflation process influencing cost conditions and also setting up \u2013 through rigidities in their formation \u2013 the short-run trade-off that monetary policy has to address. Unlike most advanced and many emerging market economies, the heterogeneity of labour markets and large presence of self-employed as well as the unorganised sector makes it difficult to collate and compile labour market and wage statistics on a regular basis. In order to assess wage pressures, therefore, the Reserve Bank uses a wide range of information. (ii) Unit labour costs (ULCs), arrived at as a ratio of staff cost to value of production, have risen in the recent period for both manufacturing and services sector entities (Chart II.B.2). (iii) Rural wages gauge wage pressures in the unorganised sector. Notwithstanding definitional changes, starting November 2013, which render temporal comparison difficult, modest softening in monthly rural wage growth appears to be underway (Chart II.B.3). (i) In the organised sector, growth in per unit employee costs1 extracted from balance sheets of companies engaged in manufacturing and services have remained moderate in recent quarters (Chart II.B.1). (iv) Information on item level indices for services in the CPI (IW) can proxy for wages as they predominantly reflect wages paid to labourers. A combined index incorporating seven such services2 indicates that the cost of these services increased in recent months (Chart II.B.4). Sources: Charts II.B.1 and II.B.2 are based on CapitaLine database. Chart II.B.3 is based on Labour Bureau data. Rural wage data was available for 18 occupations till October 2013 and is available for 25 occupations under a revised methodology since November 2013. 1 The estimate is based on data for around 400 companies in manufacturing and around 200 companies in services. Per employee cost = Total employee expenses/total number of employees. 2 Includes doctors\u2019 fees, private tuition fees, cycle rickshaw fares, barber charges, washing/ironing charges, tailoring charges and laundry charges. Domestic activity recorded a distinct upturn during Q1 of 2014-15. Improvement in business confidence has driven up investment demand after a two year hiatus, but consumption spending remains subdued. Industrial activity slumped in July after having picked up in Q1 supported by a steady rise in exports. Skewed and deficient monsoon is likely to dampen growth in the agriculture sector while the prospects for services are still mixed. The Indian economy expanded at a faster than expected pace in Q1 of 2014-15 after eight successive quarters of sluggish growth. This has infused business sentiment with guarded optimism on the near-term outlook. Exports of goods and services in real terms have recorded double-digit growth for four successive quarters in spite of headwinds from a weak global economy and domestic supply constraints. Nevertheless, risks to agriculture from the skewed spatial distribution of the south-west monsoon and the still sluggish prospects for service sector activity will challenge efforts to sustain the momentum of activity over Q2 and Q3 of 2014-15. contribution of private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) to GDP growth declined over Q4 of 2013-14. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) grew robustly at 7.0 per cent, though partly lifted by the base effect of decline of 2.8 per cent in Q1 of 2013-14. Subsequently, however, the contraction in capital goods production in July 2014 and sluggish imports of capital goods have raised concerns about sustainability of the investment recovery. Accordingly, the growth in new investment intentions of the private corporate sector has been modest (Chart III.1). Real GDP at market prices grew at 5.8 per cent in Q1 of 2014-15 - higher than 4.2 per cent a year ago - buoyed by net exports and a turnaround in gross fixed capital formation (Table III.1). In spite of election-related expenditure in April and May, the erosion of purchasing power by inflation and moderating real wage growth took its toll and the Sustained progress in putting stalled projects back to work is key to a durable reinvigoration of animal spirits in investment activity. This could also crowd-in new investment and provide a much needed stimulus to aggregate demand. So far, however, surmounting this gridlock has proved formidable as a number of factors are driving the time overruns in project implementation, including land acquisition, forest clearance and supply of raw material. Yet another binding constraint is the energy sector outlook with uncertainty regarding coal supply. I. Private Final Consumption II. Govt Final Consumption III. Gross Fixed Capital Formation IV. Net Exports Expenditure on subsidies was significantly lower at 33 per cent of BE from 51 per cent a year ago. Tax revenue dipped to 15 per cent of BE than 16.4 per cent a year ago on lower collections under custom duties and union excise duties. Non-tax revenues were also lower, mainly on account of interest and dividend receipts (Table III.2). Going forward, introduction of goods and services tax (GST) will provide a boost to the manufacturing sector. Net exports rose by 30.2 per cent in Q1 of 2014-15, providing valuable contribution to aggregate demand in spite of a subdued global recovery. Underpinning this improvement, export growth picked up to 11.5 per cent in Q1 of 2014-15, benefiting from the competitive edge stemming from rupee depreciation in 2013-14. Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) decelerated sharply in Q1 of 2014-15 than a year ago. In terms of proportion to budget estimates (BE), the key deficit indicators of the central government, viz., the revenue deficit (RD) and the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) were marginally lower during 2014-15 (up to July) than a year ago, mainly on account of lower plan revenue expenditure and capital expenditure on defence. Reflecting the fall in merchandise trade deficit, a small rise in net exports of services, higher net investment income outgo related to servicing of equity and debt obligations and a marginal fall in net private transfers, the current account deficit (CAD) shrank to 1.7 per cent of GDP in Q1 of 2014-15, down from 4.8 per cent a year ago (Charts III.2 and III.3). Net of POL imports, the current account balance remains in surplus since Q4 of 2012-13. The financial account of India\u2019s balance of payments in Q1 of 2014-15 was dominated by direct and portfolio investments. External commercial borrowings (ECBs) and trade credit also recorded net inflows (Chart III.4). India\u2019s external sustainability indicators recorded a modest improvement, contributed by a build-up of foreign exchange reserves. The net international investment position (NIIP) remained stable at 17.6 per cent of GDP in March 2014 which is sustainable from the point of view of the debt servicing profile and a viable level of the CAD. Real GDP at factor cost rose by 5.7 per cent in Q1 of 2014-15, shrugging off eight successive quarters of sluggish momentum with industrial growth, in particular, returning to positive territory after two quarters (Chart III.5 and Table III.3). The prospects for agriculture in 2014-15 will likely be impacted by the vicissitudes of the south-west Assessment of reserve adequacy should take into account not only reserves as measured conventionally but also off-balance sheet buffers in the form of net outstanding forward purchases of the Reserve Bank, which stood at US $ 5.4 billion as at end-July 2014, and bilateral/multilateral swap lines, such as the Reserve Bank of India and Bank of Japan Currency Swap Arrangement of US $ 50 billion and the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), 2014. Under the CRA, each country\u2019s maximum access limit is equal to a multiple of its own commitment to the total pool of US $ 100 billion. monsoon. Setting in late, it gathered momentum rapidly from July and rainfall deficiency measured by Department (IMD) progressively narrowed from 43 per The Reserve Bank\u2019s production-weighted rainfall index (PRN)1 indicates a larger rainfall deficit. The spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall has been skewed (Chart III.6). The kharif foodgrain production is likely to decline by 6.9 per cent in 2014-15, while production of other crops including oilseeds and commercial crops is also likely to suffer. On the other hand, reservoir levels have risen to 79 per cent and therefore, the rabi foodgrains output, which accounts for 50.7 per cent of total production on average, could largely alleviate kharif shortfalls. The index of industrial production (IIP) grew by 4.2 per cent in Q1 of 2014-15, its fastest pace in 11 quarters. 1 PRN is calculated using contribution to total foodgrain production by each State. The pick-up in industrial activity in Q1 was driven by the capital goods sector, which recorded the highest growth in the last three years. Mining activity also recovered in Q1 from a 13-quarter slump and electricity generation registered a record level of production. However, its momentum fell in July 2014 as the IIP growth slipped to 0.5 per cent. The slowdown in manufacturing, especially the contraction in both consumer durable goods and capital goods production has added further uncertainty to the prospects for this sector. Core infrastructure industries (coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity), which constitute 37.9 per cent of the IIP, also lost some momentum in July. Service sector activity, which constitutes two-thirds of the domestic economy, picked up in Q1 of 2014-15, expanding by 6.6 per cent. Within the sector, different constituents moved at differing speeds. Construction sector benefited from the delayed arrival of the south- west monsoon. Community, social and personal services also recorded robust growth. On the other hand, the growth of financing, insurance, real estate and business services lost some momentum, reflecting the deceleration in growth of credit and deposits in the banking system. Services PMI, after peaking in June 2014, has moderated in subsequent months. Lead indicators of activity in the services sector for Q2 exhibit a mixed picture. An assessment of the aggregate demand-supply balance in the economy would be usefully informed by an empirical measurement of its potential. This involves an evaluation of two elements: (a) the cyclical behaviour of output which provides insights into the role of excess/deficient demand in the state of the economy; and (b) trend output which enables a fuller evaluation of the role of aggregate supply determined by the production structure, institutional characteristics and constraints thereon. Estimating variances in GDP over the frequency domain helps to ascertain the presence of cycles as well as to measure the duration of the fluctuations. Disentangling of irregular, seasonal, cyclical and trend components suggests that the majority of cycles in India have a duration of about 2.7 years and cycles of shorter or longer durations are less frequent in occurrence. The amplitude of cycles has dampened over time, pointing to increasing resilience of economic activity to shocks (Chart III.7). Cycles are essentially fluctuations around its potential trend. Potential output is intrinsically unobservable and measuring it is challenging at all times, but especially so in the wake of a major crisis. Measurement typically suffers from high sensitivity to methodology: for instance, the standard univariate filters suffer from bias towards the choice of end points and lack an underlying economic basis. Estimates from multivariate filters derived from a small macroeconomic model which minimise the sensitivity to end points, suggest that India\u2019s potential output growth has been falling since 2008-09 to about 6.3 per cent in 2012-13 and since then the output gap has turned negative (Chart III.8). Juxtaposing estimates of average duration of cycles and potential growth suggests that the Indian economy may be approaching a turning point after two years of sluggish growth but, given the decline in potential output growth, the expansion phase may be shallower than before. continued to decline in Q4 of 2013-14, corroborating the presence of slack in the economy (Chart III.10). Capacity utilisation levels and inventory cycles provide information on the degree of slack in the economy. The order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank points to seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation recording a modest decline in Q1 (Chart III.9). Finished goods as well as raw material inventories as ratios of sales In summary, there are tentative signs of investment turning around in an environment of improving macro- economic fundamentals and political stability. Downside risks to a durable pick-up in investment and growth stem from domestic supply constraints, particularly with regard to power, a reversal in the global interest rate cycle and re-emergence of geopolitical risks. Financial markets have been upbeat, reflecting ebbing volatility and strengthening confidence in the outlook shared by domestic and foreign investors. Domestic money, debt and foreign exchange markets have remained stable and stock prices reached record highs. Growth in credit in the banking system, however, has turned sluggish. The Reserve Bank implemented a new liquidity management framework which provides greater assurance and flexibility on liquidity. Domestic financial markets have been buoyant through Q2 of 2014-15, spurred by the risk-off search for yields in international markets, and a pick-up in business confidence domestically with the onset of political stability. The ebbing of international crude oil prices with the easing of geo-political tensions and expectations of improvement in domestic macro- fundamentals boosted market sentiment. Overnight money market rates hardened during July as liquidity condition was tight. From mid-August, however, money market rates moderated, while in September, barring a brief spike on account of advance tax payments, rates eased below the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) repo rate. A distinct feature of this period has been the drop in call money volumes, reflecting shifts by banks to the collateralised overnight segments. The call money market currently accounts for around 10 per cent of the total turnover in the overnight segment (Chart IV.1). The thinness of the call money market tended to amplify volatility in July and early August with the top five borrowers accounting for more than 50 per cent of call market turnover (Chart IV.2). In the government securities market, yields inched up in the first half of July, trading with a bearish note as geo-political tensions in the Middle East pushed up crude oil prices. Subsequently, bullish sentiment returned on the back of announcement of a new 10-year benchmark security and re-adjustment of limits for investment by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in government securities. Positive sentiment spilled over into August, boosted by the reduction in notified amounts under the remaining primary auctions for the first half of the year as well as the easing of crude oil prices as tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine abated. In September, yields moved in a tight range in the absence of any triggers. The 10-year yield declined through Q2 from 8.7 per cent at the end of June to 8.5 per cent on September 29 (Chart IV.3). Trading volumes have declined sizeably throughout the quarter. The corporate bond market recorded a pick-up in activity during Q2 with an increase in offerings of public issues and rights issues, partly reflecting tightening bank credit conditions. Debt mobilisation through public issues and private placements has been significantly higher during July-August 2014 than that in the preceding quarter. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) invested `1,124 billion in the corporate bonds as on September 29, 2014 which amounted to about 46 per cent of the limit. Yields of AAA rated corporate bonds generally moved in line with gilt yields, while spreads have been broadly stable after picking up in early August. In the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate of the rupee has moved in a narrow range of `59.7 and `61.6 against the US dollar during the quarter. Pick up in import demand and strengthening of the US dollar modestly weakened the rupee in July and early August. Thereafter, bunched inflows on account of FIIs, particularly into the debt market, and positive sentiment sparked by a narrower than expected current account deficit for Q1 as well as the credibility of fiscal consolidation helped the rupee to appreciate. In September, the rupee generally remained range-bound with pessimism on US interest rate expectations offset by positive sentiment triggered by the upturn in India\u2019s GDP growth in Q1 and easing of tensions in Ukraine. The softening of crude oil prices also supported the rupee. For the quarter as a whole, the rupee depreciated against the US dollar albeit with some appreciating bias during the second week of August to first week of September. The rupee was at `61.43 against the US dollar on September 29, 2014 (Table IV.1). The rupee has been appreciating in nominal effective terms since March 2014. Against the euro, the rupee appreciated by 5.2 per cent during Q2. Since July, forward premia have softened, tracking the spot market. Equity markets rose through Q2 to reach historic highs on formation of a stable government at the centre, modest improvement in corporate earnings and positive expectations following exemption granted to banks by the Reserve Bank on reserve requirements for raising funds for infrastructure. The uptrend generally tracked global equity markets. Expectations of quantitative easing by the ECB, sustained FII investments (Chart IV.4), easing geo-political tensions and the resulting softening of crude oil prices and the recent revision in India\u2019s sovereign rating outlook from negative to stable by Standard & Poor\u2019s helped in boosting equity markets. Towards the end of the quarter, the equity markets pared some of the gains on concerns following geo-political tensions in Syria and the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict to de-allocate coal blocks. During Q2 so far (up to September 29, 2014), both the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty recorded an increase of around 5 per cent. In the primary market, activity picked up mainly on the back of issuances through qualified institutional placements (QIPs) for debt repayment and capital expenditure. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) announced a slew of measures related to IPOs and offers-for-sale, including 25 per cent public shareholding norms for public sector undertakings as also issued guidelines for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts. In addition, the government decided to raise about `43.5 billion through disinvestment of public sector undertaking (PSU) shares. The credit market has been subdued through Q2, with non-food credit growth decelerating on account of risk aversion related to asset quality as well as weak demand in general. With deposit growth remaining largely flat, a decline in credit growth led to a negative wedge (since August 2014) between credit and deposit growth, indicative of an increase in availability of structural liquidity with banks (Chart IV.5). Mirroring the slowing of bank credit growth, the flow of financial resources to the commercial sector has been lower than a year ago and higher funding has been obtained from non-bank sources (Chart IV.6). Bank credit to agriculture recorded a higher year-on-year growth of 18.8 per cent in August 2014 as compared with 12.1 per cent in August 2013. Growth in credit to industry decelerated sharply to 7.6 per cent in August (ARCs), bulk repayments by oil/fertilizer PSUs and reduction in banks\u2019 exposures in view of the stress on assets. During 2014-15 so far (up to September 25), term deposit rates and weighted average lending rates (WALR) have softened marginally. With moderation in inflation, however, this has translated to a modest tightening of credit conditions in real terms. The transmission of policy actions across market segments has been asymmetrical in various phases of the interest rate cycle (Table IV.2). 2014 from 17.3 per cent in August 2013 with lower growth in sectors such as infrastructure, basic metals, textiles, chemicals and food processing industries. Credit growth to the services sector also decelerated substantially during this period (Chart IV.7). This slowdown mainly reflects medium and large scale industries sourcing funds through commercial paper (CP) and external commercial borrowings (ECBs), sales of assets by banks to asset reconstruction companies A key factor influencing financial market behaviour is the movement of liquidity which, in turn, reflects the interplay of structural and frictional factors impinging on the system. A broad measure of liquidity encapsulating the impact of both factors is money supply or M3. The growth rate (year-on-year) of money supply at 13.2 per cent during 2014-15 (up to September 5) has been running somewhat higher than a year ago (Chart IV.8). Tightening Phase Mar. 19, 2010 to Apr. 16, 2012) The major components, i.e., currency with the public and deposits, rose at a faster pace this year. Currency demand was higher on account of the spending during the general elections in April-May, but it has fallen back to usual levels in subsequent months. Movements in reserve money essentially capture the Reserve Bank\u2019s response to various autonomous forces impacting liquidity conditions. The expansionary effects of the Reserve Bank\u2019s operations in the foreign exchange market \u2013 which experienced sizable surplus conditions through most of 2014-15 so far \u2013 were more than offset by a decline in net domestic assets (Chart IV.9). the repo rate, occasionally rising towards the MSF rate. Six special term repos of tenors varying between 3-day to 7-day for a cumulative amount of `650 billion were conducted. By the first week of August, liquidity eased as Government spending began to gather momentum and the call rate moved down again to sub-repo rate levels. Thereafter, it reversed and as liquidity tightened The choice of instrument for liquidity management is based on an assessment of the sources of liquidity pressures from time to time - whether frictional or structural; transient or lasting. With call rates trading with a softening bias below the LAF repo rate during the first week of July, a 4-day term reverse repo was conducted to absorb excess liquidity, but it met with a tepid response as market participants showed reluctance to part with liquidity over periods beyond 24 hours. With spending by the government delayed by the passing of the Union Budget, liquidity conditions tightened again, and the call rates tended to hover above on account of the build-up in cash balances of the Government, the Reserve Bank conducted one special term repo and two variable rate overnight repos, in addition to its regular operations, for a total amount of `247 billion (Chart IV.10). By mid-August, increasing expenditure by the Government along with a pick-up in deposits relative to credit off-take significantly expanded system-wide liquidity through the rest of the month and the first half of September. With effect from September 5, the Reserve Bank revised and fine-tuned its liquidity management framework under which overnight variable rate reverse repo auctions were conducted in the first half of September to absorb excess liquidity (Box IV. 1). In summary, the progressive evolution of the term repo auctions as the main instrument of frictional liquidity management is expected to improve the transmission of policy impulses across the interest rate spectrum. Money, debt and foreign exchange markets have generally mirrored liquidity conditions and will follow incoming information, both global and domestic. Equity markets have displayed robust optimism and may continue to be supported by the global search for yields, although reversal in market sentiments surrounding the US monetary policy tightening remains a clear risk. Credit growth is expected to pick-up in the second half of 2014-15 as the industrial recovery gains momentum. The Reserve Bank\u2019s operating framework of monetary policy aims at anchoring the weighted average call rate around the policy repo rate as the first leg of monetary policy transmission. Liquidity management broadly encompasses: (a) the ability to generate precise projections of the likely evolution of the liquidity conditions driven by autonomous factors; and (b) timely use of appropriate discretionary liquidity injection/ absorption measures (Table IV.B.1). Near term forecasts of liquidity incorporate full information judgement and time series estimation to capture momentum, seasonality and special factors such as festivals. Its features include: (a) assured access to liquidity of 1 per cent of NDTL (excluding ECR) in the form of bank-wise overnight fixed rate repos of 0.25 per cent of NDTL and the balance through variable rate 14- day term repos; (b) more frequent auction of term repos during a fortnight, allowing flexibility to banks to alter their liquidity assessment four times during the fortnight and participate in auctions accordingly; and (c) higher frequency of access to Reserve Bank\u2019s overnight liquidity, with the introduction of variable rate overnight repos/reverse repo auctions between 3 to 3.30 PM, besides extending the timing of ECR facility to 5 PM. The Reserve Bank has put in place a revised liquidity management framework since September 5, 2014. Economic activity in the advanced economies turned up in Q2 of 2014, while in emerging market economies, it generally decelerated. Inflation in the advanced economies continues to be benign and below set targets, as economic slack persists. Several emerging market economies continue to face inflationary pressures alongside sluggish activity. Global commodity prices have eased and financial markets are buoyant, barring some volatility on geo-political tensions in early August and intermittent reactions to incoming data. Global economic activity shed some of the weakness experienced in Q1 of 2014 \u2013 induced by harsh weather and inventory adjustment \u2013 and picked up modestly in Q2 on stronger consumer spending in the US and the UK. Growth in the advanced economies (AEs) is expected to firm up gradually through 2014 as financial conditions ease and monetary policy remains highly accommodative, but the recovery is vulnerable to downside risks from weak investment activity and possible escalation of geo-political tensions. Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) generally experienced deceleration of growth in Q2 \u2013 barring China on policy stimulus and India on improved business sentiment \u2013 and prospects for 2014 appear to be held back by structural constraints and subdued consumption and investment demand (Table V.1). World trade growth has tracked the fragile recovery, but the recent firming up appears hesitant, having slipped behind global GDP growth since Q4 of 2011 (Table V.1). The World Trade Organization (WTO) has lowered its world trade growth forecast for 2014 to 3.1 per cent in September from 4.7 per cent in April. This is attributed to global recovery not being broad-based and unsteady in the first half of 2014, trade slowdown in major EMEs as a result of weak global recovery itself, and escalation of geopolitical tensions. Both AEs and EMEs are susceptible to risks of reversal in sentiment and re-pricing of risk premiums in global financial markets, especially if US long-term interest rates rise faster than expected. Inflation remains subdued in the AEs. In the US, annual inflation declined to 1.7 per cent in August with core inflation remaining unchanged. Inflation in Japan increased sharply on the back of the hike in the value added tax (VAT), but moderated to 3.4 per cent in July. Excluding the impact of VAT, headline inflation was much lower at 1.3 per cent in July, with core inflation at 0.6 per cent. Euro area inflation remained unchanged at 0.4 per cent in August, primarily on account of lower energy prices. In the UK, inflation remains below the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2.0 per cent, declining to 1.5 per cent in August. In EMEs, the picture is mixed with China experiencing lower inflation due to weakening domestic demand, while Brazil, Russia and Turkey face upside pressures due to domestic food price pressures and exchange rate depreciation. Other EMEs such as Indonesia and India have undertaken policy-driven disinflation. Unlike in the AEs, several EMEs continue to face inflationary pressures and their persistence suggests structural characteristics, warranting a broader policy strategy rather than merely front-loading of monetary policy. World energy prices have begun to ease after remaining largely range bound during 2014, with Brent prices declining by 9.5 per cent between April and September to US $ 97.5 per barrel in September (Chart V.1). Notwithstanding risks of supply disruptions due to geo-political conflicts, global supply has held up on account of increased supplies from OPEC members and higher production in the US. Market participants expect oil prices to ease in the medium-term with Brent future contracts for December 2015 being traded at US $ 99.7 per barrel as on September 26, 2014. Non-energy prices have also been softening since May, plateauing in July and August 2014. Global food prices, which have been declining since March 2014, fell to a seven-month low in August. This was driven by reduction in grain prices since March following plentiful harvests in the US (Chart V.2). The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) forecasts stable food prices for the next 10 years. Overall, commodity prices are expected to remain stable, perhaps indicating the end of the commodity super-cycle that started in the late 1990s (Box V.1). With well anchored inflation conditions and sizable slack, central banks in the AEs have persevered with highly accommodative monetary policies, with forward guidance indicating that the policy stance will remain supportive of the recovery. In September 2014, the Fed kept its policy rate unchanged, but announced a further reduction in its asset purchases by $10 billion Commodity super-cycles are long and rapid rises in prices across commodities, propelled by persistent increases in demand outstripping supply. Since 1894, four super-cycles have been identified, with the last one starting from the late 1990s and attributed to rapid and sustained industrialisation and urbanisation in China and other emerging economies. In this latest commodity super-cycle, inflation adjusted prices of commodities rose in the range of 60 to 500 per cent between 1999 and its peak in 2010. Oil price rose by467 per cent, metals by 202 per cent and agricultural prices by 77 per cent - the largest price increases among all the four commodity super-cycles. Another striking characteristic of the recent super-cycle relative to its predecessors is high correlation across commodity prices and high price volatility, possibly owing to financialisation of commodity markets and increase in supply disruptions due to natural disasters. The sustained moderation in commodity prices since 2012 - across the board - from their peak levels has generated some debate around the question of whether the latest commodity super-cycle has come to an end. Given the pace of innovation and physical investment, supply- side costs are still rising due to resource depletion, while EMEs are expected to grow without any drastic reversal of commodity demand. In fact, commodity prices have occasionally shown signs of reviving more quickly than global economic activity. On the other hand, the world economy may be entering a phase of stable but secularly lower levels of growth, keeping commodity prices stable but higher than the level that prevailed before the current super-cycle phase began. Asymmetric Christiano and Fitzgerald band pass filters commonly used to identify commodity super cycles show that both real energy prices and real non- energy prices have already reached inflexion points and are turning onto on a downward phase (Chart V.B1). to a total of $15 billion. The ECB further reduced its key policy rate to 0.05 per cent and raised the charge on deposits to -0.20 per cent in September in order to encourage bank lending, and would start purchasing asset-backed securities and covered bonds in October. The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have also retained high accommodation in their monetary policy stances, the former keeping unchanged the monetary base target, and the latter maintaining the policy rate and size of the asset purchase programme (Chart V.3). In EMEs, monetary policy stances have been mixed, reflecting diverse domestic economic conditions as well as inflationary and exchange rate pressures. Turkey has started reducing its policy rate since May with improving global liquidity conditions and moderation of the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on inflation. some re-pricing of risk with country-specific accents. The sharp rise in asset prices has raised the risk of financial instability in the event of an unanticipated bursting of building equity/ real estate bubbles. The US dollar appreciated significantly against major currencies since July as conditions for recovery in the US economic activity became more favourable. In the EMEs, currency markets stabilised with normalisation of capital flows, barring sporadic responses to incoming data. Reduced currency volatility also increased the attractiveness for carry trade targeting EME currencies in general (Chart V.5). The eventual reversal of carry trade poses a major risk to macro-stability. Similarly, Chile has been slowly reducing its policy rate since February 2014 due to weakening domestic activity. By contrast, Russia has been on a tightening mode, raising its policy rate since March 2014 to contain inflationary pressures. Brazil has been maintaining a high policy rate for the past several months as inflationary pressures persist, despite entering into recession. South Africa and Malaysia have also raised policy rates in July to address inflationary pressures. China and Indonesia, on the other hand, have kept their policy rates steady for the past several months (Chart V.4). International financial markets are experiencing a generalised ebbing of volatility since early 2014 as \u2018taper\u2019 fears subsided, and a widening of the search for returns triggered a resurgence of capital flows. Although volatility picked up in August 2014 on geo-political concerns across bond and equity markets, losses have been recovered by early September as risk appetite was whetted by announcements of further stimulus in the Euro area. The search for returns appears to have resumed strongly while volatility has fallen back to new lows. EME financial markets have been buoyed by the reach for yields and the uptick in volatility in August proved to be a temporary aberration, accompanied by In sum, global economic slack would persist even though recovery has modestly firmed in the advanced economies. Structural constraints and political tensions would mute growth in EMEs. As inflationary pressures appear benign, given the economic slack and stable commodity prices, AEs are likely to persist with their easy monetary policy stance. Among EMEs confronted with stubborn inflation experiences, the headroom for monetary policy action may increasingly become constrained by weaker than desirable economic activity. While financial markets and commodity prices would remain stable, an earlier than expected reversal in policy rate in the US could put pressures on these markets. "}
