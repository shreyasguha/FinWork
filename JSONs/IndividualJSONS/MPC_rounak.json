{"Apr_2019": "The sixteenth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from April 2 to 4, 2019 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit confidence, households\u2019 conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation,  reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.0 per cent from 6.25 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to maintain the neutral monetary policy stance. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the last MPC meeting in February 2019, global economic activity has been losing pace. In the US, the subdued performance in the final quarter of 2018 appears to have continued into Q1:2019 as reflected in declining factory activity. The Euro area slowed down in Q4:2018 on soft domestic demand and contracting manufacturing activity. Of its constituents, the Italian economy contracted for two consecutive quarters in Q3 and Q4. In the UK, growth slowed down on Brexit uncertainty, with industrial production contracting during September-January. The Japanese economy rebounded in Q4 on increased domestic consumption expenditure and recovering investment spending. However, the latest data on manufacturing activity and business confidence suggest that growth lost momentum in Q1:2019. The monetary policy stances of the US Fed and central banks in other major advanced economies (AEs) have turned dovish. Economic activity also slowed down in some major emerging market economies 7. (EMEs). The Chinese economy decelerated in Q4:2018 on subdued domestic and global demand impacting industrial activity. Much of this weakness seems to have continued into 2019 as reflected in low factory output in Q1, though the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) moved into expansion zone in March after three months of contraction. In Q1, the Russian economy continued to be impacted by both domestic and external headwinds. The Brazilian economy ended 2018 on a weak note; going into 2019, available economic indicators for Q1 suggest that economic activity remained restrained by both weak domestic and external demand. The South African economy slowed down in the final quarter of 2018. Subdued industrial activity and worsening external demand point to a further loss in momentum in Q1. 8. Crude oil prices have risen on production cuts by OPEC and Russia as well as disruption in supplies due to US sanctions on exports from Venezuela. Gold prices weakened on expectations of positive outcomes of the China-US trade deal. Inflation continued to remain low in major AEs and many key EMEs due to slowing global growth and stable or falling commodity prices. 9. Financial markets continued to be driven by monetary policy stances of key central banks and movements in crude oil prices. In the US, the equity market witnessed some selling pressure in the last week of March on weak economic data. Equity markets in EMEs gained, benefitting from country-specific factors and easing of global financing conditions. Bond yields in the US softened, slipped into negative territory in Germany and dipped further into negative territory in Japan as central banks signalled softer stances. Bond yields in most EMEs have been falling in tandem with those in AEs and on the improving inflation outlook. In currency markets, the US dollar has traded with an appreciating bias in recent weeks. EME currencies have traded with a depreciating bias on country-specific factors and on fears of a weakening economic outlook in China. 10. Turning to the domestic economy, the second advance estimates for 2018-19 released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in February 2019 revised India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth downwards to 7.0 per cent from 7.2 per cent in the first advance estimates. Domestic economic activity decelerated for the third consecutive quarter in Q3:2018-19 due to a slowdown in consumption, both public and private. However, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth remained in double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter in Q3, with the GFCF to GDP ratio rising to 33.1 per cent in Q3:2018-19 against 31.8 per cent in Q3:2017-18, supported primarily by the government\u2019s thrust on the road sector and affordable housing. The drag on aggregate demand from net exports also moderated in Q3 due to a marginal acceleration in exports and a sharp deceleration in imports led by a decline in crude oil prices. 11. On the supply side, the second advance estimates of the CSO placed the growth of real gross value added (GVA) lower at 6.8 per cent in 2018-19 as compared with 6.9 per cent in 2017-18. GVA growth slowed down to 6.3 per cent in Q3 due to a deceleration in agriculture output from the record level achieved in the previous year. Industrial GVA growth remained unchanged in Q3, with manufacturing GVA growth slowing somewhat. Services GVA growth also remained unchanged in Q3; while growth in construction activity accelerated, there was some loss of momentum in public administration, defence and other services. 12. Beyond Q3, the second advance estimates of foodgrains production for 2018-19 at 281.4 million tonnes were 1.2 per cent lower than the fourth advance estimates of 2017-18, but 1.4 per cent higher than the second advance estimates of 2017-18. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US, El Ni\u00f1o conditions strengthened during February 2019, which may affect the prospects of a normal south west monsoon. Of the high frequency indicators of industry, the manufacturing component of the 13. index of industrial production (IIP) growth slowed down to 1.3 per cent in January 2019 due to automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and machinery and equipment. The growth of eight core industries remained sluggish in February. Credit flows to micro and small as well as medium industries remained tepid, though they improved for large industries. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, however, as measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), improved to 75.9 per cent in Q3 from 74.8 per cent in Q2 exceeding its long-term average; the seasonally adjusted CU rose to 76.1 per cent from 75.4 per cent. The business assessment index of the industrial outlook survey (IOS) points to an improvement in overall sentiments in Q4. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) remained in expansion zone for 20th month in March. The key indicators of investment activity contracted, viz., production of capital goods in January and imports of capital goods in February. 14. High frequency indicators of the services sector suggest significant moderation in activity. Sales of commercial vehicles contracted during February. Other indicators of the transportation sector, viz., port freight traffic and international air freight traffic, also contracted. However, indicators of the construction sector, viz., consumption of steel and production of cement, continued to show healthy growth. The hotels sub-segment showed some improvement in foreign tourist arrivals in January and international air passenger traffic in February. The services PMI continued to be in expansion zone for the tenth consecutive month in March 2019. 15. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, rose to 2.6 per cent in February after four months of continuous decline. The uptick in inflation was driven by an increase in prices of items excluding food and fuel and weaker momentum of deflation in the food group. However, inflation in the fuel group collapsed to its lowest print in the new all India CPI series. 16. Within the food group, deflation in four sub-groups \u2013 vegetables, sugar, pulses and fruits \u2013 continued in February. Egg prices moved into inflation after remaining in deflation in previous three months, while inflation ticked up in all other food sub-groups. 17. Inflation in the fuel and light sub-group collapsed from 4.5 per cent in December to 1.2 per cent in February. Prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) declined sharply, pulled down by the lagged impact of the softening of international energy prices. The prices of firewood, with the second largest weight in the fuel group, also declined. Electricity slipped into deflation in January and February. Inflation in kerosene remained elevated, however, reflecting the impact of the calibrated increase in its administered price. 18. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel declined to 5.2 per cent in January, but rose to 5.4 per cent in February, driven by a broad-based pick-up in inflation in the personal care and effects, and recreation and amusement sub-groups. However, inflation in the clothing and footwear, and transport and communication sub-groups fell, the latter reflecting the reduction in petrol and diesel prices. Inflation in the health and education sub-groups remained elevated, even though it moderated markedly during January-February vis-\u00e0-vis December. 19. Inflation expectations, measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of households, declined in the February round over the previous round by 40 basis points each for the three months ahead and for the one year ahead horizons. Firms participating in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey of manufacturing companies reported reduction in input price pressures, but they expected an increase in staff expenses in Q1:2019-20. Farm and industrial input costs increased at a slow pace in January-February 2019. Nominal growth in rural wages and staff costs in the organised manufacturing and services sectors remained muted in Q3:2018-19. From a daily net average surplus of \u20b927,928 crore (\u20b9279 billion) during February 1-6, 20. 2019, systemic liquidity moved into deficit during February 7 - March 31, reflecting the build-up of government cash balances. Currency in circulation expanded sharply in February- March. The liquidity needs of the system were met through injection of durable liquidity amounting to \u20b937,500 crore (\u20b9375 billion) in February and \u20b925,000 crore (\u20b9250 billion) in March through open market purchase operations (OMOs). Consequently, total durable liquidity injected by the Reserve Bank through OMOs aggregated \u20b92,98,500 crore (\u20b92,985 billion) for 2018-19. Liquidity injected under the LAF, on an average daily net basis, was \u20b995,003 crore (\u20b9950 billion) during February (February 7-28, 2019) and \u20b957,043 crore (\u20b9570 billion) in March. The weighted average call rate (WACR) remained broadly aligned with the policy repo rate in February and March. Anticipating the seasonal tightening of liquidity at end-March, the Reserve Bank 21. conducted four longer term (tenor ranging between 14-day and 56-day) variable rate repo auctions during the month in addition to the regular 14-day variable rate term repo auctions. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank conducted long-term foreign exchange buy/sell swaps of US$ 5 billion for a tenor of 3 years on March 26, 2019, thereby injecting durable liquidity of \u20b934,561 crore (\u20b9346 billion) into the system. 22. Export growth remained weak in January and February 2019 mainly due to exports of petroleum products decelerating in response to a fall in international crude oil prices. Among non-oil exports, engineering goods, chemicals, leather and marine products recorded either sequentially lower or negative growth. As in the case of exports, lower international crude oil prices downsized the oil import bill. Non-oil non-gold imports declined sharply, dragged down by the subdued demand for pearls and precious stones, transport equipment, project goods and vegetable oils. The trade deficit narrowed in February 2019 \u2013 both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis \u2013 to its lowest level in 17 months. This, along with the increase in services exports and lower outgo of income payments, resulted in narrowing of the current account deficit sequentially. On the financing side, net FDI inflows were strong in April- January 2018-19. Foreign portfolio investors turned net buyers in the domestic capital market in Q4:2018-19. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 412.9 billion on March 31, 2019. Outlook 23. In the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of February 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 2.8 per cent for Q4:2018-19, 3.2-3.4 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.9 per cent for Q3:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced around the central trajectory. Actual inflation outcomes averaged 2.3 per cent in January-February. 24. The inflation path during 2019-20 is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, low food inflation during January-February will have a bearing on the near-term inflation outlook. Second, the fall in the fuel group inflation witnessed at the time of the February policy has become accentuated. Third, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel in February was lower than expected, which has imparted some downward bias to headline inflation. Fourth, international crude oil prices have increased by around 10 per cent since the last policy. Fifth, inflation expectations of households as well as input and output price expectations of producers polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s surveys have further moderated. Taking into consideration these factors and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, the path of CPI inflation is revised downwards to 2.4 per cent in Q4:2018-19, 2.9-3.0 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 3.5- 3.8 per cent in H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced. 25. GDP growth for 2019-20 in the February policy was projected at 7.4 per cent in the range of 7.2-7.4 per cent in H1, and 7.5 per cent in Q3 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced. Since then, there are some signs of domestic investment activity weakening as reflected in a slowdown in production and imports of capital goods. The moderation of growth in the global economy might impact India\u2019s exports. On the positive side, however, higher financial flows to the commercial sector augur well for economic activity. Private consumption, which has remained resilient, is also expected to get a fillip from public spending in rural areas and an increase in disposable incomes of households due to tax benefits. Business expectations continue to be optimistic. Taking into consideration the above factors, GDP growth for 2019- 20 is projected at 7.2 per cent \u2013 in the range of 6.8-7.1 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced. 26. Beyond the near term, several uncertainties cloud the inflation outlook. First, with the domestic and global demand-supply balance of key food items expected to remain favourable, the short-term outlook for food inflation remains benign. However, early reports suggest some probability of El Ni\u00f1o effects in 2019. There is also the risk of an abrupt reversal in vegetable prices, especially during the summer months. Second, inflation in fuel group items, particularly electricity, firewood and chips saw unprecedented softening in H2:2018-19. There is, however, uncertainty about the sustainability of this softening in inflation in fuel items. Third, the outlook for oil prices continues to be hazy, both on the upside and the downside. On the one hand, continuing OPEC production cuts will reduce supplies. On the other hand, there is considerable uncertainty about demand conditions. Should there be a swift resolution of trade tensions, a pick-up in global demand is likely to push up oil prices. However, should trade tensions linger and demand conditions worsen, crude prices may fall from current levels, despite production cuts by OPEC. Fourth, inflation excluding food and fuel has remained elevated over the past twelve months with some pick up in prices in February. However, should the recent slowdown in domestic economic activity accentuate, it may have a bearing on the outlook for inflation in this category. Fifth, financial markets remain volatile reflecting in part global growth and trade uncertainty, which may have an influence on the inflation outlook. Sixth, the fiscal situation at the general government level requires careful monitoring. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis 28. points and maintain the neutral stance of monetary policy. 29. Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. Dr. Chetan Ghate and Dr. Viral V. Acharya voted to keep the policy rate unchanged. 30. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision to maintain the neutral stance of monetary policy. Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to change the stance from neutral to accommodative. 31. 30. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision to maintain the neutral stance of monetary policy. Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to change the stance from neutral to accommodative. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by April 18, 2019. Voting on the Resolution to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 bps to 6.0 per cent Member Dr. Chetan Ghate Dr. Pami Dua Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra Dr. Viral V. Acharya Shri Shaktikanta Das Since the last review, the continual decline in both 3 month and 1 year ahead 33. inflationary expectations of households is encouraging. Households\u2019 current inflation perception is below 7%. The percentage of respondents expecting inflation below 6% for 3 month and 1 year ahead horizons has also been increasing over different survey rounds. It should be noted that although the 1 year ahead inflationary expectation declined by 40 bps to 8.1% compared to the previous round it is still only 50 bps below the March 2018 value (8.6%). The elevated level of inflation ex food and fuel continues to be a concern, although I 34. am more sanguine about its trajectory after the last few prints. My major concern with inflation ex food and fuel is that sequential gains continue to be strong. Inflation ex food fuel will only be buttressed by the rise in crude prices (USD 68.3 on April 2 versus USD 62.2 on February 7, equivalent to a 9.8% increase since the last review). Crude prices have also remained resilient despite lower projections for global growth. Oil is not a \u201cHotelling\u201d good (constraints in different locations prevent supply responses that would otherwise help in mitigating overall price rises). This makes inflation management challenging. 35. Food prices continue to be subdued although the extent of disinflation is falling. The unusually low summer uptick in food inflation (3.2%) combined with a sharp decline in winter prices in FY 19 has kept food prices unexpectedly low. The shift in momentum of food in the last couple of prints indicates that low food inflation has possibly reached a nadir. I re-iterate my concern from the last review: RBI\u2019s projections for Q4 2019-2020 headline inflation continue to be on the lower side because of an assumed low momentum for food. If vegetable prices rebound in April-August in a stronger way, RBI\u2019s projections will be easily breached. What compounds problems this time is the rise in the price of crude, although there has been an off-setting impact because of the nominal appreciation of the rupee (3.3% since the last review). It wouldn\u2019t hurt to wait for a couple of months to watch the momentum on food inflation and other variables before taking a call on further rate cuts. 36. The major question in this review is whether there is sufficient accumulation of downside risks on growth to warrant a monetary policy response. Are the drivers of growth fading? 37. My sense is that that the business cycle depicts \u201cearly cycle\u201d weakness. At this juncture, I see sub 7% growth rates confined possibly to just two quarters: Q3 and Q4 FY 19. These will be our \u201ckitchen-sink\u201d quarters (i.e., quarters where the most adverse outcomes to the economy are realized). Looking at the momentum on GDP growth (Q-o-Q SAAR), there has also been an uptick in Q3 FY 19. 38. Various RBI surveys don\u2019t depict an economy in collapse. PMIs in Manufacturing and Services continue to be in expansion zone for several months, capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector has gone up sequentially in the last four quarters (76.1% seasonally adjusted in Q3), adjusted non-food credit grew by 14.8% in March 2019 compared with 11.3% in the last fiscal year, and there has been a sharp uptick in consumer confidence (a positive \u201csentiment shock\u201d) with the future expectation index at an all-time high. 39. Notwithstanding this, what is worrying is the performance of private final consumption expenditures (PFCE), about 59% percent of GDP. A variety of high frequency indicators look fairly weak which nowcast a loss in growth momentum. 40. What confounds this however is the fairly robust numbers for PFCE growth (8.4% Q3 FY 19 and 9.8% Q2 FY 19), (although admittedly, this is partly due to the outsized role that livestock had in the PFCE numbers for Q3 FY 19). Looking at data from April 2017 \u2013 January 2019 for consumer durables, out of 22 months, only 6 months showed negative growth. For non-durables, only 2 months out of 22 months showed negative growth. Consumer durables growth in Q2 was 8.1% in FY 19, and 6.0% in Q3. Consumer non- durables growth was 6.1% in Q2 FY 19 dropping to 4.6% in Q3 FY 19. In contrast, GFCF (gross fixed capital formation) has risen over the past few quarters 42. to 33.1% of GDP in Q3: 2018-2019. RBI\u2019s study on \u201cPrivate Corporate Investment in India: Slow Recovery Underway\u201d and enterprise surveys depict planned capex showing a turn- around in 2018-2019, with inventory ratios moving down in manufacturing. 43. showing signs of stress. Somewhat worrying though is that the machine and equipment component of GFCF is 44. In terms of consumption-investment linkages, somewhat more concerning is some preliminary econometric evidence, using data from 1996: Q2 to 2018: Q4 that PFCE growth (quarter on quarter, seasonally adjusted) drives GFCF growth with a lag of two quarters. Simple Granger causality tests also suggest that consumption demand drives investment demand and not vice versa. This suggests that subdued consumption growth may cause investment growth to taper, signs of which should be carefully watched. 45. I continue to view the elevated levels of the combined fiscal deficit and the on-going thrust towards competitive populism as jeopardizing the durability of inflation in the medium term. This should be carefully watched. 46. On the external front, while India\u2019s overall growth rates have always been somewhat immune to our export performance, I view the muted performance of exports and imports over the last four months with concern. 47. Given the above reasons, maintaining status quo on rates at the current juncture would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over the medium-term. Contrary to some of my colleagues in the MPC, I feel that frequent changes in policy rates and stance runs the risk of introducing uncertainty and volatility because of our own actions. I will, however, carefully watch the incoming growth-inflation data and am open to a 48. reassessment of my views. I also vote to retain a neutral stance. 50. Headline inflation rose to 2.6% in February 2019 after four months of continuous decline. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel declined to 5.2% in January but increased to 5.4% in February, driven by an increase in personal care and effects, recreation and amusement sub-groups. On the basis of quarterly data, headline inflation fell from 4.8% in Q1: FY18-19 to 3.9% in Q2 and 2.6% in Q3. As per RBI projections, it is expected to decline to 2.4% in Q4 before rising to 2.9% in Q1: FY 19-20 and 3% in Q2. CPI excluding food and fuel has declined from 6.3% in Q1: FY 18-19 to 5.9% in Q3: FY 18-19. This softening in inflation is also exhibited in consumer and producer expectations. 51. Inflation expectations in the March 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Survey of Households softened by 40 basis points each for the three-month ahead and one-year ahead horizons, vis-\u00e0-vis the last round in December 2018. Further, the proportion of respondents expecting higher inflation declined. The gap between current inflation perceptions and expectations also narrowed, indicating anchoring of inflation expectations at a lower level. According to the January-March 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey, manufacturing firms expect a moderation in pressure in selling prices in Q1: 2019-20 with easing of input cost pressures. Salary costs, however, are expected to firm up. As per the Business Inflation Expectations Survey conducted by IIM-Ahmedabad in February 2019, businesses expect moderation in one-year-ahead CPI headline inflation from December 2018. The Economic Cycle Research Institute\u2019s (ECRI) Indian Future Inflation Gauge, a harbinger of inflation, remains in a cyclical downswing, indicating that underlying inflation pressures are still subdued. 52. In the coming months, upside risks to inflation include a potentially weak monsoon; uncertainty in oil prices and how weaker global demand conditions may weigh against OPEC\u2019s production decisions; volatility in financial markets; trade tensions; and the possibility of fiscal slippage. Downside risks include low food prices; moderation in inflation excluding food and fuel; and slowdown in global growth. 53. On the output side, RBI lowered its projection for GDP growth for 2019-20 from 7.4% in the February policy to 7.2%. Indicators paint a mixed picture, with weakening investment activity that is reflected in a slowdown in production and imports of capital goods. On the other hand, consumer confidence improved in the March 2019 round of RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey, with an uptick in both current perceptions as well as future expectations, which is at an all-time high. This upward trajectory can be attributed to an improvement in sentiment with respect to general economic situation, employment scenario and price levels. According to RBI\u2019s Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilization Survey (OBICUS), capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector improved in Q3 from the previous quarter. The Business Expectations Index of RBI\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey, however, signals moderation in optimism in Q1: 2019-20. At the same time, the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) remained in expansion zone for the twentieth month in March, while the services PMI continued in expansion zone for the tenth successive month in March 2019. Meanwhile, ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Index growth has increased in recent months, indicating an improved growth outlook. ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Exports Index growth continues to languish, however, suggesting that Indian exports growth will ease due to pessimistic prospects for global growth. 54. On the global front, ECRI\u2019s international long leading indexes, including those for the U.S., Eurozone and China, are in continued cyclical downswings, pointing to a further slowdown in global growth. In fact, according to ECRI's 20-Country Long Leading Index, the global growth outlook is the worst it has been in three years. In the U.S., the Fed has not only doubled down on its abrupt about-face with regard to policy \u201cnormalization,\u201d but also indicated that no rate hikes are planned this year, and only one rate hike is planned next year. As a result, the U.S. futures markets see no chance of a rate hike but some chance of a rate cut later this year, with some risk of recession. As expected, these cyclical prospects have resulted in an end to monetary policy \u201cnormalization\u201d plans not only in the U.S., but also around the world, while opening up more room for policy easing. Meanwhile, ECRI\u2019s international future inflation gauges, which are predictors of the direction of inflation, are pointing to the intensification of worldwide disinflation. Thus, the global prognosis is one of slow growth accompanied by benign inflation. 55. In view of the global growth slowdown and a benign global and domestic inflation outlook, I vote for decreasing the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and maintaining the neutral stance. 56. In the MPC meeting of February, 2019, I had explicitly stated that a space of 50 to 60 bps policy rate cut had opened up and that I would like to cut the repo rate by 25bps to begin with. Developments after the February MPC meeting have further opened up additional space of about 40 to 50 bps. The monthly headline CPI inflation prints of January and February 2019 have continued to undershoot the RBI projections substantially, forcing the RBI for further downward revision of headline inflation from 2.8 to 2.4 percent for Q4:FY 2018-19. Other developments on increase of USD 5 per barrel in crude oil prices, exchange rate appreciation, energy price revisions and monsoon expectations have all together led the RBI to revise its projections of the headline inflation trajectory downwards by 30-40 bps for the next 12 months. This is a very positive development on front of price stability in the economy and has opened up space for correcting the real interest rates in the system decisively. In my opinion, there are not even remote chances for the headline inflation to breach the medium term target of 4 percent substantially in foreseeable future for two consecutive quarters or even one quarter. On the other hand, there are serious concerns about the growth performance of economy. Global pessimism on growth and developments on domestic front have led the RBI to revise its growth projections downward for 2019-20. For 3 to 4 quarters in a row, from Q3:2018-19 to Q2:2019-20, the Indian economy is most likely to register a sub-seven percent real growth thereby substantially opening up an output gap exerting downward pressure on wage and price inflation. As per the mandate given to the MPC, under such circumstances, we need to give a sustained boost to the economy. I, therefore, vote for a change of stance from neutral to accommodative with a 25 bps cut in the policy repo rate, though I would have preferred to cut it by 35-40 bps this time. More precise reasons for my vote are as follows: ii) While the crude oil prices show volatility and a recent rising tendency, their sustainability at higher levels is doubtful. Moreover, their pass-through to domestic inflation has also not occurred to the fullest extent in recent times. In my opinion, it may not be a major cause of worry for domestic inflation till it breaches the level of USD 80 \u2013 85 per barrel on a durable basis, which is unlikely. Thus, oil prices, vegetable prices and fruit prices present volatile elements and any increase in them can at best be considered only temporary shocks as per our recent experience. They may not be considered durable shocks needing any policy response given the recent experience. The energy prices including electricity which have been subdued of late are likely to remain so for the next 10-12 months because any substantial price revisions are not on cards. The inflation ex-food and fuel is also likely to show a sharper decline in coming months because the inflationary expectations are getting anchored. v) As per the RBI survey, the household inflationary expectations 3 months and 12 months ahead continued to decline for the fourth consecutive bi-monthly round sharply and this time by 40 bps each. Moreover, the gap between the household perception and their expectations about inflation is narrowing over recent rounds. The IIM Ahmedabad survey of Businesses also show a continuing decline in their headline CPI inflationary expectations 12 months ahead by 53 bps. Thus, the inflationary expectations are getting anchored as targeting policy implementation. Even the RBI projections of the headline CPI inflation 12 months ahead have been below the targeted 4 per cent for two consecutive policies. The core inflation (with whatever definition but theoretically correct concept) will no longer be sticky at high levels and will show tendency towards the medium term target sooner than later. is usually expected with any In this context, the concept and measurement of the output gap and more importantly its relationship with unemployment gap is crucial. On one hand, some economists argue that there is hardly any output gap (particularly if adjusted for financial factors); and on the other hand, several economists are emotionally arguing about existence of serious involuntary unemployment. These two contradictory views cannot be reconciled theoretically within the same macroeconomic model unless we consider measurement issues. Potential output and its growth in a rapidly developing emerging market economy like India needs to be measured differently than in a typical structurally stable and relatively slow growing advanced economy. Similarly, involuntary unemployment needs to be measured in such an economy avoiding all well-known limitations about disguised unemployment and underemployment. I have been consistently arguing that unless the real growth exceeds 8-8.5 percent per annum, the output gap reflecting the unemployment gap in the economy is not likely to close. Till that point, there would be downward pressure on the labour market and market determined wages and thereby on the so-called \u2018core\u2019 inflation. vii) The downward revision of real growth from 7.4 to 7.2 percent for the coming year 2019-20 by RBI, therefore, opens up the output gap reflecting the unemployment gap substantially and needs a policy response. This is all the more so, because there are significant downside risks to the growth projection in my opinion. Due to global slowdown and US trade actions, our exports are already suffering. Investment has not revived to reach its earlier peak. The fiscal policy is constrained because of the lack of fiscal space and impending general elections. It is, therefore, the monetary policy that needs to provide the boost since, as per the mandate given to MPC, inflation is well under control. Cutting the policy rate gradually over time would correct the real interest rate in the economy and encourage investments. In this context, it is also relevant to note that most of the Central Banks globally have changed their tone to dovish. 57. This is the right time to act decisively. When the pitch is favourable and no possibility of bouncers or googlies coming in, a well set batsman has to score and not miss the opportunity to build the total by defending unnecessarily. I would, therefore, continue to cut the policy rate by 25bps and change the stance to accommodative indicating that any hikes in the rates are off the table for the time being. 58. emerging out of five months of deflation. Three features of the upturn are noteworthy. As anticipated by the MPC, inflation turned up in February 2019, lifted by food prices 59. First, the January and February readings of inflation that became available after the MPC met last in February have undershot the projection made in that meeting. It is reasonable to expect that the March reading - that will become available on April 12 - may reveal that food prices are out of deflation, but headline inflation is still softer than the February meeting projection. I belabour this point because it informs the error correction process that is concurrently taking place. 60. Second, the entire inflation projection path of the MPC's April 2019 meeting has shifted downwards by 30-40 basis points from its trajectory in the February meeting. This is important in a forward-looking sense because as intermediate variables that provide a first glimpse of monetary policy's unseen and moving targets, the projections are indicating that the primary mandate assigned to the MPC appears secured at this juncture \u2013 inflation will likely remain at or below target over the 12-month horizon for which forecasts are available. 61. Third, the one year ahead projection of inflation seems to be validated by incoming data. Survey results indicate that households, businesses and professional forecasters have become more optimistic on the inflation outlook than before over the same time horizon. In the case of households, there is also evidence of the anchoring of expectations. Consumer confidence in the inflation outlook remaining benign over the year ahead is rising. Signals extracted from all this information would argue that if the primary target for monetary policy is likely to be achieved on a durable basis, some space opens up for policy attention to the objective of growth as enjoined by the RBI Act. 62. Given this headroom, the dilemma is two-fold: (1) with growth expected to accelerate from 7 per cent in 2018-19 to 7.2 per cent in 2019-20, is policy support really needed? (2) even if the case is admissible, is it the right time to steer monetary policy in defence of growth? Why not exercise prudence and wait and watch for durable signs of underlying pressures on inflation other than food or fuel easing, and/or indications that the slowdown in growth is not a soft patch but a cyclical downswing? This may avoid wasting ammunition. 63. To speak to these questions, the baseline projection of growth is subject to downside risks. First, we are already living in a world in which India\u2019s real GDP growth averaged 6.5 per cent in the second half of 2018-19, not 7 per cent. Even if the horizon is extended to incorporate the projections for the first half of 2019-20, real GDP growth is still expected to be sub-7 per cent. Second, the drivers of growth are fading. Data that have arrived since the MPC\u2019s February meeting indicate that demand conditions in the manufacturing sector are slowing down, with the weakening of sales of fast moving consumer goods implying that consumption spending may be losing steam. Meanwhile, capacity utilisation in manufacturing is running above trend in the absence of investment in new capacity. This suggests that the current pace of growth could be difficult to sustain if the capex cycle does not start up soon. Given the limited fiscal space, the support from government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) that has held up growth \u2013 GDP growth excluding GFCE was 6.3 per cent in 2017-18 (as against the headline GDP growth of 7.2 per cent) and 6.8 per cent in 2018-19 (7.0 per cent)1 \u2013 may not be available going forward. Exports have flattened, with the slowing down of global growth and trade imparting downside risks. Non-oil non-gold imports have contracted, indicative of weakening domestic demand. Third, I continue to maintain the view that the biggest risks to growth are global. Some 64. of these risks are already materialising. Global growth estimates and projections are being marked down as incoming data confirm the loss of momentum that is underway. Capital flows to EMEs have returned after a turbulent year gone by, but safe haven demand restrains a fuller resumption, and uncertainty in financial markets remains high. Crude prices are firming up, with financialisation of energy stocks adding upside. 65. Monetary policy has a overarchingly domestic orientation. With inflation being quiescent and growth at risk, I vote for a reduction in the policy rate by 25 basis points while maintaining a neutral policy stance. I will, however, remain watchful about the upturn in food prices that usually precedes the onset of the monsoon. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 66. In the minutes of the February 2019 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, I had provided several reasons for why I had voted to keep the policy rate at 6.5% and the stance at neutral. Since then, the headline inflation prints have revealed further softening of inflation in 67. January, followed by a pick-up in February. Notably, inflation excluding food and fuel softened unexpectedly in January, while reverting somewhat in February; nevertheless, it remains uncomfortably close to 5.5%. Food inflation, in contrast, has behaved more in line with the expectations; fuel inflation has remained unusually weak. 68. As per my assessment, these outcomes combined with a further softening of household inflation expectations and a marginal opening up of the output gap (traditional measure), would have justified a rate cut of 25 basis points from 6.5% to 6.25% at the April meeting. In particular, the softening of inflation excluding food and fuel gives greater durability to the inflation path remaining around the target rate of 4% in the medium term even if the policy rate were to be reduced from 6.5% to 6.25%. However, given that the MPC had already cut the policy rate to 6.25% at its February meeting, the relevant decision now for me was whether to reduce the policy rate further from 6.25%. I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged at 6.25% for similar reasons as echoed in 69. my February meeting statement, with some additional uncertainties that I flag below. 70. First, oil prices have marched upwards by an additional 10% since the February policy. This rise has taken the Brent Crude price closer to $70 per barrel. Its momentum cannot be taken lightly given the uncertainty witnessed last year on oil prices and the pressure it puts on inflation, the external sector and financial markets. While the pass-through to consumers remains somewhat incomplete at present, it will eventually hit the pump prices and generalise through transportation fares into non-fuel components of headline inflation. 71. Second, food deflation has attendant fiscal risks, as I explained in detail in my February meeting statement. Fiscal responses to deal with agrarian distress resulting from low food prices can impart a significant upside risk to the inflation trajectory, an uncertainty that may get partly resolved in the coming months. Third, let me reiterate that inflation excluding food and fuel remains uncomfortably 72. close to 5.5%, i.e., at elevated levels as through most of the past twelve months. This is confirmed also in rising staff costs in the formal sector. Conversely, it is only the benign food inflation that is allowing the monetary policy to not respond to the discomforting elevated levels of inflation excluding food and fuel. An important observation on food inflation is in order; in all of recent years, even as the level of food inflation has trended downward, it has remained highly volatile within each year; peak-to-trough cycle in food inflation typically tends to be of around 8 months duration, and the month of February has already shown some seasonal uptick in prices of several food items. Hence, soft food inflation may not persist for long, a scenario in which the elevated level of inflation excluding food and fuel would steer the headline inflation away from the target rate of 4%. This can risk hardening of inflation expectations of households. 73. Fourth, professional forecasters are pegging inflation trajectory somewhat higher than that of the Reserve Bank; this is due to their factoring in some fiscal slippage for this year as well as post-election, as gathered from their qualitative responses. Dissaving induced by such fiscal slippage also creates a rather weak transmission of monetary policy to the private and household sectors of the economy as bank deposits compete with small savings and corporate bonds with government securities. These factors, combined with mixed news regarding the prospects of a normal 74. monsoon suggest to me that this is a particularly inopportune time to reduce the interest rate. In 2-4 months, several uncertainties as posed above are likely to be resolved, helping steer interest rates in a clear direction, upward or downward or simply staying put, depending on how the risks play out. In the meantime, efforts could be made to improve the financial system structurally for better transmission of monetary policy to the real economy, especially as there are headwinds to such transmission from the rise in overall public sector borrowing requirement. 75. On the growth front, signals from the domestic economy are mixed. Capacity utilisation continues to improve which augurs well for future investment, and services growth remains robust; however, consumption demand shows signs of weakness. Global growth is exhibiting a synchronised slowdown; as I have contended in my past statements, mild moderation of global growth benefits India through a downward pressure on oil prices; it is extreme moderation that hurts India and more so through the financial flows channel rather than the trade channel, the latter having been largely insensitive to external prospects in recent years. 76. Aggregate flow of financial resources to the commercial sector remains robust with banks substituting for the weak credit growth of non-banks; bank credit growth continues to be above nominal GDP growth; equity markets have been buoyant; foreign portfolio flows have reversed into India following the dovish stance of advanced country central banks; together, these imply that the finance-neutral output gap, my preferred measure of output gap which accounts for financial cycles, continues to remain closed. 77. On balance, therefore, notwithstanding signs of weakness in growth evinced in high frequency economic indicators, I am inclined to wait for some more time for incoming data to resolve several important uncertainties that will shape the Indian economy in the coming one or two years. The counter-factual exercises suggest that 6.25% policy repo rate is just \u201cright\u201d for achieving headline inflation target of 4% on a durable basis in the medium term; continuing oil price rise or fiscal impulses or seasonal uptick in volatile vegetable prices would likely require some tightening down the road; only a substantial collapse in global growth, which seems unlikely at present given proactive responses of central banks in advanced economies and China, would justify a rate cut at this point. Hence, I am erring on the side of caution, choosing to be patient, rather than supporting another rate cut on the back of MPC\u2019s February decision to cut the rate. Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 78. Since the last policy in February 2019, there has been further weakening of domestic growth impulses, with global growth slowdown posing major headwinds to India\u2019s exports. Inflation has continued to surprise on the downside. CPI inflation for January and February averaged 2.3 per cent as against projection of 2.8 per cent for the January-March quarter of 2019 in the February policy. Accordingly, inflation for Q4:2018-19 in all likelihood is set to be lower than that projected in the February policy. 79. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated from 5.6 per cent in December to 5.4 per cent in February. The spike in prices in the health and education sub-groups in December proved to be a one-off phenomenon. The food group continued to be in deflation for the fifth consecutive month in February. Inflation in the fuel and light sub-group unexpectedly collapsed from 4.5 per cent in December to 1.2 per cent in February, with electricity prices remaining in deflation. Inflation expectations of households, measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of households, declined in the February round over the previous round by 40 basis points each for the three-month ahead and the one-year ahead horizons. With this, inflation expectations have declined cumulatively by as much as 160 basis points for the three-month ahead and 170 basis points for one-year ahead horizons in the last four survey rounds. 80. In comparison with the February policy, CPI inflation projection is now revised downwards by 30-40 basis points to 2.4 per cent in Q4:2018-19, 2.9-3.0 per cent in H1:2019- 20 and 3.5-3.8 per cent in H2, with risks broadly balanced. This baseline inflation scenario, however, is subject to several uncertainties, especially from crude oil and food prices. More precisely, the uncertainties/risks include: (i) the highly uncertain outlook for oil prices, which are vulnerable to both upward pressure due to continuing OPEC production cuts, as well as downward pressure due to further slowing down of the global economy; (ii) the risk of an abrupt reversal in vegetable prices, which may get accentuated due to deficient monsoon should there be El Ni\u00f1o conditions; and (iii) inflation excluding food and fuel may soften further from the present levels if the recent slowdown in domestic economic activity intensifies. The fiscal situation at the general government level also needs a careful vigil. Given India\u2019s large dependence on imports of crude oil, stability in international crude oil prices is critical for domestic macroeconomic stability. 81. Moving on to economic activity, high frequency indicators suggest a further loss of pace in growth. Private consumption has been weakening as reflected in deceleration in the growth of passenger car sales and domestic air passenger traffic, weak performance of consumer durables and non-durables, and continuing contraction in non-oil non-gold imports. Investment activity has also decelerated due to contraction in production of capital goods in January and imports of capital goods in February. On the supply side, industrial growth has weakened as reflected in deceleration in the growth of index of industrial production (IIP) for January; the growth of core industries for February remained sluggish. However, capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector has improved and is also above the long-term average. In the services sector, sales of commercial vehicles, port freight traffic and international air freight traffic contracted during February. However, indicators of the construction sector, viz., growth in consumption of steel and production of cement, continued to show healthy growth. 82. Overall financing conditions have continued to improve as reflected in the total flow of resources to the commercial sector. However, bank credit flows to micro and small as well as medium industries remain extremely weak. GDP growth for 2019-20 has been revised downwards to 7.2 per cent \u2013 in the range of 6.8-7.1 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced. 83. Investment demand is losing traction and a deceleration in exports may further impact investment activity. With the inflation outlook looking benign and headline inflation expected to remain below target in the current year, it becomes necessary to address the challenges to sustained growth of the Indian economy. Hence, I vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. I would like to state here that there is a need to consider interest rate adjustments, not necessarily in the conventional way of 25 bps or multiples thereof. This idea needs further debate and discussion. Further, with several uncertainties facing the economy, it is appropriate to maintain the neutral stance of monetary policy. 84. The RBI will continue to watch the evolving growth and inflation dynamics and shall act in time and act decisively while ensuring price stability on an enduring basis in pursuance of its mandate under the RBI Act. ", "June_2019": "The seventeenth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during June 3, 4 and 6, 2019 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Viral V. Acharya, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the in detail staff\u2019s projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation,  reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent from 6.0 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.50 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.0 per cent. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Global economic activity has been losing pace after a somewhat improved performance in Q1:2019, reflecting further slowdown in trade and manufacturing activity. Among advanced economies (AEs), economic activity in the US strengthened in Q1, supported by higher government spending, increase in private investment and a lower trade deficit. However, factory activity and retail sales moderated in April. Economic activity in the Euro area has remained weak due to muted industrial activity and weak business confidence. Leading indicators point to a further slowdown in the Euro area in Q2. In the UK, GDP growth for Q1 picked up on high retail sales and government expenditure. However, the outlook is clouded by uncertainty relating to Brexit. The Japanese economy accelerated in Q1 on net exports gains and increased public investment. In April, industrial production improved, while retail sales fell. 7. Economic activity has slowed in many emerging market economies (EMEs). In Q1:2019, the Chinese economy grew at the same pace as in the previous quarter, though slightly above consensus expectations. However, incoming data on industrial production and retail sales suggest that the growth momentum may weaken in Q2. The Russian economy, which had shown some signs of recovery in Q4:2018, weakened in Q1 on muted domestic activity and trade. Economic activity in South Africa contracted in Q1 pulled down mainly by a sharp decline in manufacturing activity. Brazil\u2019s economy contracted in Q1 for the first time since 2016 and there are fears that it could return to recession. Crude oil prices remained volatile, reflecting evolving demand-supply conditions 8. underpinned by the production stance of the OPEC plus, rising shale output, weakening global demand and geo-political concerns. The strengthening of the US dollar had weakened gold prices; however, prices picked up since the last week of May on escalating trade tensions, reviving its demand as a safe haven asset. Inflation remains below target in several economies, though it has shown an uptick since March. 9. Financial markets have been driven by uncertainties surrounding US-China trade negotiations and Brexit. In the US, the equity market has experienced some selling pressures since early May on escalation of trade tensions with China and recently, with Mexico. Equity markets in most EMEs have lost steam due to the waning risk appetite on rising geo-political uncertainties and weakening global trade prospects. Bond yields in the US picked up in April on better GDP data for Q1, but declined in May on subdued economic data and expectations of a dovish monetary policy stance. Bond yields in Germany slipped into negative territory on weak economic data; in Japan, they remained negative on indications of sustained accommodation. In many EMEs, bond yields have been falling with central banks adopting accommodative monetary policy to boost economic growth. In currency markets, the US dollar strengthened on better than expected domestic economic data for Q1. Most EME currencies have depreciated against the US dollar. 10. Turning to the domestic economy, on May 31, 2019 the National Statistical Office (NSO) released quarterly estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) for Q4:2018-19 and provisional estimates of national income for 2018-19. GDP growth for 2018-19 has been estimated at 6.8 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y), down by 20 basis points from the second advance estimates released on February 28, pulled down by a downward revision in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) and moderation in exports. Quarterly data show that domestic economic activity decelerated sharply to 5.8 per cent in Q4:2018-19 from 6.6 per cent in Q3 and 8.1 per cent in Q4:2017-18. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth declined sharply to 3.6 per cent, after remaining in double digits in the previous five quarters. Private consumption growth also moderated. The drag on aggregate demand from net exports increased in Q4 due to a sharper deceleration in exports relative to imports. However, the overall slowdown in growth was cushioned by a large increase in government final consumption expenditure (GFCE). On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities contracted, albeit marginally, in 11. Q4:2018-19 due to a decline in rabi production. According to the third advance estimates, foodgrains production at 283.4 million tonnes for 2018-19 was lower by 0.6 per cent compared with the previous year mainly due to lower production of rabi rice, pulses and coarse cereals. However, there has been a catch-up in foodgrains production relative to earlier estimates. Foodgrains stocks at 72.6 million tonnes as on May 16, 2019 were 3.4 times the prescribed buffer norms. Growth in manufacturing activity weakened sharply to 3.1 per cent from 6.4 per cent in the previous quarter. Service sector growth, however, accelerated, supported by financial, real estate and professional services, and public administration, defence and other services. In contrast, construction activity slowed down markedly. 12. Moving beyond Q4, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that south-west monsoon rainfall (June to September) is likely to be normal at 96 per cent of the long period average (LPA). The current weak El Ni\u00f1o conditions over the Pacific are likely to continue during the monsoon. However, currently prevailing neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions may turn positive in the middle of the monsoon season and persist thereafter, which augur well for the rainfall outlook. 13. Growth in eight core industries decelerated sharply in April, pulled down largely by coal, crude oil, fertilisers and cement. Credit flows from banks to large industries strengthened, though they remained muted for micro, small and medium industries. Based on early results of the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector improved to 77 per cent in Q4 from 75.9 per cent in Q3; seasonally adjusted CU, however, slipped marginally to 75.2 per cent in Q4 from 75.8 per cent in Q3. The business assessment index (BAI) of the industrial outlook survey (IOS) in Q1:2019-20 remained unchanged at its level in the previous quarter. Imports of capital goods \u2013 a key indicator of investment activity \u2013 remained anaemic in April. However, the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) edged up to 52.7 in May with strengthening of output, new orders and employment. High frequency indicators suggest moderation in activity in the service sector. Sales of 14. commercial vehicles, tractors, passenger cars, and three and two wheelers contracted in April. Railway freight traffic growth decelerated. Domestic air passenger traffic growth contracted in March, but turned around modestly in April. Two key indicators of construction activity, viz., cement production and steel consumption, slowed down in April. The PMI services index moderated to 50.2 in May on subdued growth of new businesses. 15. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in CPI, remained unchanged in April, at its March level of 2.9 per cent, with higher inflation in food and fuel groups being offset by lower inflation in items excluding food and fuel. 16. The April food inflation print showed an increase to 1.4 per cent from 0.7 per cent in March. Within the food group, vegetables moved out of nine months of deflation. However, three sub-groups, viz., fruits, pulses and sugar, remained in deflation in April, though the extent of deflation moderated. Among other food sub-groups, inflation in prices of milk, oils and fats, spices, non-alcoholic beverages and prepared meals moderated, while inflation in meat, fish and eggs prices ticked up. 17. Inflation in the fuel and light group rose to 2.6 per cent in April from the February trough of 1.2 per cent, pulled up by prices of liquified petroleum gas due to an increase in international prices. Inflation in subsidised kerosene also rose, reflecting the impact of the calibrated increase in its administered price. Electricity prices moved out of three months of deflation in April. Prices of rural fuel consumption items \u2013 firewood, chips and dung cake \u2013 moved into deflation. 18. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel fell sharply to 4.5 per cent in April from 5.1 per cent in March \u2013 the largest monthly decline since April 2017. The moderation in inflation was broad-based, with household goods and services, and personal care and effects sub-groups registering the largest fall in April; housing inflation was the lowest since June 2017, reflecting softening in house rents in urban areas. Inflation in clothing and footwear also touched its historical low in the new all-India CPI series. Inflation in education, health and transportation and communication moderated as well. 19. Inflation expectations of households in the May 2019 round of Reserve Bank\u2019s survey declined by 20 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon compared with the previous round, but remained unchanged for the one-year ahead horizon. However, manufacturing firms participating in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expect input cost pressures to intensify on account of higher raw material costs and salaries in Q2. Input price pressures eased in both agricultural and industrial raw materials. Nominal growth in rural wages and in organised sector staff costs remained muted. Liquidity in the system turned into an average daily surplus of `66,000 crore (`660 20. billion) in early June after remaining in deficit during April and most of May due to restrained government spending. The Reserve Bank injected liquidity of `70,000 crore (`700 billion) in April and `33,400 crore (`334 billion) in May on a daily net average basis under the LAF. It conducted two OMO purchase auctions in May amounting to `25,000 crore (`250 billion) and a US dollar buy/sell swap auction of US$ 5 billion (`34,874 crore) for a tenor of 3 years in April to inject durable liquidity into the system. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 remained broadly aligned with the policy repo rate: it traded above the policy repo rate (on an average) by 6 bps in April, but below the policy repo rate by 6 bps in May. The Reserve Bank has announced that it would conduct an OMO purchase auction of `15,000 crore (`150 billion) on June 13, 2019. 21. Transmission of the cumulative reduction of 50 bps in the policy repo rate in February and April 2019 was 21 bps to the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans. However, the WALR on outstanding rupee loans increased by 4 bps as the past loans continue to be priced at high rates. Interest rates on longer tenor money market instruments remained broadly aligned with the overnight WACR, reflecting near full transmission of the reduction in policy rate. 22. Exports were unable to sustain the growth of 11.8 per cent observed in March 2019; they grew by 0.6 per cent in April 2019 dragged down by engineering goods, gems and jewellery, and leather products. Imports grew at a somewhat accelerated pace in April 2019 relative to the preceding month, driven by imports of petroleum (crude and products), gold and machinery. This led to a widening of the trade deficit, both sequentially and on a y-o-y basis. Provisional data suggest that net services exports in Q4:2018-19 were broadly comparable to their level a year ago which bode well for the current account balance. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment flows were stronger in Q4:2018-19 than a year ago. After a sharp recovery in March 2019, net foreign portfolio inflows were relatively modest at US$ 2.3 billion in 2019-20 in April-May. While the equity segment received net inflows during this period, the debt segment witnessed net outflows. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 421.9 billion on May 31, 2019. 23. In the bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of April 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 2.4 per cent for Q4:2018-19, 2.9-3.0 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.5-3.8 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced. The headline inflation outcome in Q4 at 2.5 per cent was largely in alignment with the April policy projections. The baseline inflation trajectory for 2019-20 is shaped by several factors. First, the 24. summer pick-up in vegetable prices has been sharper than expected, though this may be accompanied by a correspondingly larger reversal during autumn and winter. More recent information also suggests a broad-based pick-up in prices in several food items. This has imparted an upward bias to the near-term trajectory of food inflation. Second, a significant weakening of domestic and external demand conditions appear to have led to a sharp broad- based decline of 60 bps in inflation excluding food and fuel in April; this has imparted a downward bias to the inflation trajectory for the rest of the year. Third, crude prices have continued to be volatile. However, its impact on CPI inflation has been muted so far due to incomplete pass-through. Fourth, near-term inflation expectations of households have continued to moderate. Taking into consideration these factors, the impact of recent policy rate cuts and expectations of a normal monsoon in 2019, the path of CPI inflation is revised to 3.0-3.1 per cent for H1:2019-20 and to 3.4-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Risks around the baseline inflation trajectory emanate from uncertainties relating to 25. the monsoon, unseasonal spikes in vegetable prices, international fuel prices and their pass- through to domestic prices, geo-political tensions, financial market volatility and the fiscal scenario. 26. In the April policy, GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected at 7.2 per cent \u2013 in the range of 6.8-7.1 per cent for H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent for H2 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced. Data for Q4:2018-19 indicate that domestic investment activity has weakened and overall demand has been weighed down partly by slowing exports. Weak global demand due to escalation in trade wars may further impact India\u2019s exports and investment activity. Further, private consumption, especially in rural areas, has weakened in recent months. However, on the positive side, political stability, high capacity utilisation, the uptick in business expectations in Q2, buoyant stock market conditions and higher financial flows to the commercial sector augur well for investment activity. Taking into consideration the above factors and the impact of recent policy rate cuts, GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 7.2 per cent in the April policy to 7.0 per cent \u2013 in the range of 6.4-6.7 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.2-7.5 per cent for H2 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). The MPC notes that growth impulses have weakened significantly as reflected in a 27. further widening of the output gap compared to the April 2019 policy. A sharp slowdown in investment activity along with a continuing moderation in private consumption growth is a matter of concern. The headline inflation trajectory remains below the target mandated to the MPC even after taking into account the expected transmission of the past two policy rate cuts. Hence, there is scope for the MPC to accommodate growth concerns by supporting efforts to boost aggregate demand, and in particular, reinvigorate private investment activity, while remaining consistent with its flexible inflation targeting mandate. 28. Against this backdrop, all members of the MPC (Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Shri Shaktikanta Das) unanimously decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and change the stance of monetary policy from neutral to accommodative. 29. 28.

Acharya Shri Shaktikanta Das 31. Since the last review, there has been a further decline in the 3 month ahead inflationary expectations by 20 bps but with no change in the 1 year ahead inflationary expectations. Both the three month ahead inflationary expectations and the current perception of inflation have now declined in 4 consecutive rounds reflecting more benign inflation conditions. While inflationary expectations from RBI\u2019s household survey may have bottomed out, I find it encouraging that the 58th round of the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) indicates better anchoring of inflationary expectations to the medium target of 4 percent. 32. While headline inflation evolves in line with projections (April print was 2.92%, March print was 2.86%), food inflation has ticked up and doubled since the March print. I have been concerned that one year ahead headline inflation projections have been assuming lower food momentum, small deviations from which could easily make headline inflation projections breach the 4% target. More realistic baseline parameter assumptions used in current projections however rectify this, and suggest that 1 year ahead headline projections will undershoot the 4% medium target (average Q4 FY 20 values are 3.8%). 33. Inflation ex food fuel has precipitously dropped by 60 bps to 4.5% in April from 5.1% in March, which is the lowest print since September 2017. Even factoring in the latent pass through of the spike in crude that happened before the general election results were declared on May 23, the month-on-month SAAR rate for inflation ex food and fuel is still subdued in April 2019 (around 1.87%). I see two risks here: first, the INR has depreciated more than other EME currencies in 34. the last one year; second, crude prices tend to make the INR more vulnerable. I continue to remain watchful of the risk that the INR and crude will have on the trajectory of inflation ex food and fuel. Food inflation, however, will continue to normalize in the April-August period. It remains to be seen how strong the spillovers are from a cyclical seasonal movement, especially in vegetables, on inflation ex food and fuel. This should be carefully monitored. 35. The crucial question is how deep is the cyclical downturn. On the growth front, compared to the last review, several indicators are flagging red. 36. While RBI\u2019s study on corporate performance for Q4 FY 19 indicates that demand conditions continued to moderate (proxied by nominal and sales growth of 1432 firms), this moderation was not broad-based. For instance, sales growth improved in sectors like food products and beverages, and remained steady and in double digits in cement and cement products and chemical and chemical products. Likewise, high double digit growth in sales was recorded in wholesale and retail trade and transport and storage services. Since new launches of private real estate continue to languish, it would appear that the stable growth in cement and steel could be driven by a government push in infrastructure building and affordable housing. A carefully done base-momentum decomposition analysis of seasonally adjusted Industrial GVA indicates that, during 2018-2019, barring the significant push to Industry GVA provided by the base effect in Q1, it is an unfavorable base effect which acted as a drag on industrial growth in the other quarters. Likewise, a decomposition of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) into base and momentum effects indicates that investments during Q4: 2018-2019 were down primarily due to an adverse base effect, with some deceleration in momentum. Nominal GVA growth of listed private manufacturing companies however was dented by lower staff costs, which moved into single digit growth (6.4%) after many quarters, possibly reflecting lower employment creation. 37. There is a larger issue in my mind as to why RBI\u2019s study on corporate performance paints a less drastic (or mixed) picture on the health of the economy when compared to say other indicators used in the national account statistics (NAS), or the IIP. It may possibly be because it samples a smaller universe of non-governmental non-financial (i.e., private sector) firms, although more analysis needs to be done. For instance, most consumption indicators in the IIP are now flashing red and have worsened since the last review. Consumer durable growth, reflecting stress in the auto sector, moved into contraction (-5.3%). Capital goods, reflecting the decline in machine and equipment, was also in contraction (-8.7%). Consumer non-durables growth, reflecting declines in discretionary income, was low (+0.3%). 38. These declines are reflected in a further widening in the output gap since the last review. The widening of the output gap is also in sync with a low print of Q4 FY 19 growth of 5.8%, and the virtual stalling of gross fixed capital formation growth in Q4 FY 19. 39. On the external front, the pace of activity has continued to slow down. The world output gap is more negative compared to a couple of months ago. I continue to view the consolidated fiscal deficit (as embodied in the public sector borrowing requirement) as jeopardizing the durability of the inflation target in the medium term. There are a few issues here. 40. One, our practice of fiscal policy where large swings in government final consumption expenditure in the final quarter of a fiscal year are required to meet fiscal deficit targets imparts substantial volatility to growth rates. This makes it difficult to design monetary policy. Second, fiscal \u2018prestidigitation\u2019 or sleight of hand may contribute to our own version of a \u201cdoom-loop\u201d, i.e., by pushing expenditure off budget to meet deficit targets and then recourse to borrowing from the national small savings fund by state entities keeps administrative interest rates high to incentivise such savings. This impedes monetary transmission. Poor monetary transmission requires more active fiscal policy to compensate which breaches fiscal targets once again. 41. I also worry that the very nature of the Indian growth model, which requires excessive policy induced tinkering with the inter-sectoral terms of trade to meet both distributional objectives and demand push objectives makes fiscal-monetary coordination difficult. 42. The job of good monetary policy is to close gaps. A widening negative output gap and below target inflation warrants a monetary policy response. A rate cut at the current juncture would help both close the output gap and bring inflation back to target, a situation of \u201cdivine- coincidence\u201d. Going forward, I will remain data dependent, and will carefully watch the incoming 43. growth and inflation data. I vote to cut the policy rate by 25 basis points, and shift the stance to accommodative. 45. India\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in Q4:2018-19 decelerated sharply to a 20-quarter low of 5.8%, mainly due to a decline in the growth of gross fixed capital formation to 3.6% and moderation in growth of private consumption expenditure to 7.2%. While growth in government consumption expenditure was upbeat at 13.1% in Q4:2018-19, GDP growth for FY2019 was revised to a five-year low of 6.8%. Further, growth in agriculture turned negative (-0.1%) in Q4:2018-19 for the first time since Q3:2015-16, although services remained resilient. In addition, y-o-y growth in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) decelerated in the months of January and February, followed by negative growth (-0.1%) in March. This was accompanied by negative growth in manufacturing (with 78% weight in IIP) in February and March. The use-based classification shows a declining trend in capital goods and consumer durables. Furthermore, high frequency indicators such as passenger vehicle sales, tractors and motorcycle sales suggest a slowdown in urban and rural demand. On the external front, growth in merchandise exports and imports has slowed, with exports witnessing a sharper deceleration, reflecting the slowdown in global demand, trade tensions and global uncertainties. 46. Meanwhile, the Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index increased in May due to an expansion in output, new orders and employment. Further, RBI\u2019s Business Expectations Index of the Industrial Outlook Survey for manufacturing anticipates modest improvement in Q2:2019-20. The OBICUS Survey (Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilisation Survey) conducted by RBI suggests a seasonal rise in capacity utilisation in Q4:2018-19. RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Indices \u2013 Current Situation Index and Future Expectations Index \u2013 on the other hand, reflect a drop in the May round compared to the previous March round, implying lower current activity and a less optimistic outlook. On the brighter side, higher financial flows should enhance investment. 47. Headline inflation, measured by CPI inflation, remained at its March level of 2.9% in April, with increase in food and fuel inflation partly offset by the broad-based decline of CPI inflation excluding the food and fuel groups. Trends from surveys provided mixed signals. Inflation expectations of consumers, as captured through RBI\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of Households, showed a decline for the three-month-ahead horizon by 20 basis points but were unchanged for the one-year-ahead horizon. At the same time, the Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) showed an expectation of rising input costs in the upcoming quarter (Q2:2019- 20). Going forward, upside risks to inflation include continuation of the uptick in food price international oil prices, inflation, uncertainties relating materialization of industry expectations of cost pressures as per the IOS and lastly, potential fiscal slippage. Looking at the international scenario, a revival in global economic growth remains 48. elusive, with the Economic Cycle Research Institute\u2019s (ECRI) 20-Country Long Leading Index growth rate staying near its lowest reading in almost three years. Also, US economic growth is set to slow, while an inflation cycle downturn is poised to persist, given the decline in ECRI\u2019s U.S. Future Inflation Gauge (a harbinger of inflation) to its lowest reading in over three years. Meanwhile, with ECRI\u2019s Global Leading Manufacturing Index growth staying near a seven-year low, the global industrial growth outlook remains dismal. Of particular concern is that growth in ECRI\u2019s Chinese Leading Industrial Production Index, which leads Chinese PMI data, slipped in its latest reading toward its recent multiyear low. This is the cyclical context of the recent escalation of its trade war with the US. 49. The gloomy global scenario also highlights the fact that India cannot rely on external engines of growth in the current circumstances. Thus, an internal boost to demand would be the preferable option. In the last two MPC meetings (February and April), the repo rate was cut by 25 basis points in each meeting. The transmission of these policy rate cuts of 50 bps to the weighted average lending rate (WALR) was 21 bps on fresh rupee loans. On the other hand, the WALR on outstanding loans increased by 4 bps, since past loans are priced at high rates. At the same time, longer tenor money market instruments were generally aligned with the weighted average call money rate (WACR), implying reasonable transmission of the reduction in the policy rate. In other words, while the transmission is not complete, its impact is visible. 50. Thus, given the deceleration in growth and in the context of projected headline inflation remaining below the target in 2019-20, I vote for a rate cut of 25 bps. To reinforce this, in an attempt to boost sentiment, I also vote to change the stance from neutral to accommodative. 51. In the MPC meeting of April 2019, I had clearly stated that there was a considerable space of about 75 bps to cut policy rate further and voted for a 25 bps reduction with a change of stance from neutral to accommodative. Subsequent developments have further opened up the space by about 20-25 bps. Forecast by RBI 3-4 quarters ahead on headline inflation is down by 10 bps and on annual real GDP growth by 20 bps. Oil prices have remained broadly in my expected range and are softening of late. Inflationary expectations are getting anchored. As I had argued in my statement last time, the core inflation (by whatever definition) shows a declining trend and is no longer sticky at high levels. Recent inflation prints for March and April 2019 show a sharp decline in the core inflation across several goods and services. Real interest rates are very high in the economy adversely impacting costs and thereby our global competitiveness. In my opinion, we should continue correcting our real interest rates by bringing down our policy rate. I, therefore, vote for changing the stance to accommodative and reducing the policy rate further by 25 bps, although I would have preferred to cut it by 40 bps this time. More precise considerations for my vote are as follows: i) Recent developments on global slowdown in growth and international trade, pile up of inventory of oil in USA, and geo-political tensions indicate that oil prices are not likely to breach the band of $ 58 to $ 73 on a durable basis in the near future. Therefore, its adverse impact on headline inflation, if at all, is not likely to be significant. ii) Growth has seriously dipped and can recover relatively fast on the policy support though it is likely to remain well below the potential at least for next three-four quarters. This will lead to widening of the output gap already created. It would, therefore, put further downward pressure on wages and prices. iii) Core inflation (with whatever precise definition) is already on a declining trend and is likely to continue to fall over time because of the above reasons. In addition, the inflationary expectations in the economy are also coming down. Food stocks are more than adequate and available predictions on monsoon are favourable. There is a possibility that food prices may not pick up to the extent predicted. If there are spikes in prices of some vegetables and fruits, they may be temporary and reversible over time. On the whole, there is a good chance that the food inflation and hence the headline inflation may undershoot the expectations. v) Central Banks all over the world have become more dovish in their tone and rate hikes are not only on hold but may reverse in some cases. This may generate additional space to correct our real interest rates. The concern about first, the fiscal slippage at this stage and second, its adverse impact on inflation in my opinion is both misconceived and misplaced. With substantial slowdown in real growth on one hand and inflation rate consistently undershooting both on retail and wholesale basis, the growth of nominal GDP has declined significantly compared to the one assumed for the budget preparation. Under such a cyclical downturn, the fiscal deficit can overshoot the target even without any change in the fiscal policy parameters such as tax rates and expenditure rates. This should not be considered as a fiscal slippage; otherwise the fiscal policy would turn pro-cyclical if the policy makers become obsessed to achieve the observed fiscal deficit target by reducing expenditures or increasing taxes. It would only destabilize the system further rather than stabilizing it as expected of the policy. In order to take care of this anomaly with the observed fiscal deficit target, theory suggests evaluating fiscal performance through the concept of \u201cfull-employment budget deficit\u201d or \u201cthe structural budget deficit\u201d, which is not observed but has to be calculated taking potential output rather than actual (or observed) output. In practical terms, if the slippage in fiscal deficit is on account of revenue shortfall consequent on the decline in the nominal income growth, it should not be considered a genuine fiscal slippage. If, however, the slippage is because of increased expenditures by the government, it would be a genuine slippage. The current situation needs careful consideration before we conclude on fiscal slippage, because the slippage seems to be more due to revenue shortfall than expenditure increase. Secondly, in the face of a serious slowdown in the economy, a stabilization policy such as fiscal policy should be counter-cyclical and not pro-cyclical. Temporary \u201cobserved fiscal slippage\u201d under such circumstances is neither undesirable nor damaging. The fear that it would derail the government from the path of fiscal consolidation and discipline amounts to distrusting the intentions of the government that has a clear and strong political mandate to perform. In my opinion, therefore, under present conditions, concerns about temporary fiscal slippage are misplaced. Moreover, with existence of deficient aggregate demand, minor fiscal slippage in the observed deficit would not be inflationary. Finally, in most countries that matter to us in terms of trade and finance the real rates of interest are very low; or the real policy rate is barely positive. On the contrary, our real policy rate is in excess of 2 percent and our real interest rates are very high, making our production globally less competitive. We must bring it down to realistic levels of around 1.5 percent sooner than later. With expected inflation around 3.7 percent, there is a space of about 75-80 bps of rate cut. 52. It is prudent to create space for future policy action on either side when the conditions are good. When inflation is under reasonable control and upside risks are muted, this is the right time to correct the high real rates of interest. However, we have to be careful to avoid any knee-jerk reactions and proceed slowly but steadily. It is in this context that it is still not too late in my opinion to change the stance from neutral to accommodative by reducing the policy rate further by 25 bps. 53. The formation of inflation over recent months is a story of compensating variations in components. But the sum of these parts has moved down over the twelve months ahead horizon on a trajectory that has itself been adjusted downwards four times successively (December 2018; February 2019; April 2019; and June 2019). Risks to the primary target of monetary policy are distinctly on the ebb. Inflation expectations are also better anchored than before. In fact, if one were to step back a little in time, it is evident that if the 2019-20 projections materialise, the MPC would have steered inflation at or below target on average for four years in a row in its five-year term of office. The path of inflation in 2019-20 will likely encounter transient supply shocks such as 54. pre-monsoon food price spikes, which monetary policy should look through and await their reversal. More importantly, this future path will also be conditioned by softening of more durable constituents, which perhaps mirrors the underlying state of the economy. And it is in this context that the conduct of monetary policy over the year ahead will get defined. 55. following messages: Lead and coincident indicators gleaned from surveys and other sources emit the i) weakening demand conditions facing manufacturing, which is also denting hiring elevated capacity utilisation in the absence of investment in new capacity; inventories of finished products in several sectors, including houses and automobiles; still weak pricing power among corporates; dipping consumer confidence in the economic situation and the employment outlook; professional forecasters expecting further moderation in private consumption, gross fixed investment, exports and imports. 56. I would submit that all this highlights the deterioration in the outlook for the economy in the year ahead. The recently released estimates of national income for Q4 2018-19 confirm the weakening of economic activity about which I have consistently expressed concerns in my minutes from February 2019. High frequency indicators for Q1 2019-20 point to a broad- basing of the slowdown. 57. Turning to the global economy, it is unlikely that global growth will be able to sustain the uptick in Q1 2019. Intensification of trade wars and geopolitical tensions amidst volatile crude prices and nervous financial markets render the outlook fraught with downside risks. India cannot afford to be complacent about the danger of the global slowdown deepening. In my view, the evolving macroeconomic configuration imparts urgency to strong 58. policy support for the flagging economy in pursuance of the goals set for the MPC. In fact, with inflation projected to remain below target, a higher weight needs to be assigned to growth relative to previous meetings. 59. Most important at this juncture: monetary policy by itself cannot bring about a reinvigoration of economic activity. Monetary policy is taking the lead as the first line of defence, but a coordinated full throttle effort by all arms of macroeconomic management is the need of the hour. On these considerations, I vote for a 25 basis points reduction in the policy rate and a 60. change in the stance of monetary policy to accommodation. Statement by Dr. Viral V. Acharya 61. \u201cWhy do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?\u201d wonders Santiago, the old fisherman, in \u201cOld Man and the Sea\u201d by Ernest Hemingway. I found myself preparing and writing these minutes early too, perhaps so I could have one longer drafting day! 62. Since the April 2019 meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), inflation prints have been more or less consistent with RBI\u2019s projections. Food inflation has risen more than expected, driven significantly by a seasonal summer uptick in vegetable prices. In contrast, inflation excluding food and fuel (ex-food-fuel) has registered a significant broad- based decline of 90 basis points (bps); this was both unexpected and unusually large in magnitude over a short period of two months. I have always put significant weight on ex- food-fuel inflation in my assessment of future inflation trajectory as it tends to be the more persistent component of headline inflation and it contains better signals about the underlying aggregate demand pressures. The signal conveyed by substantial softening of ex-food-fuel inflation has only been corroborated by the large negative surprise of the Q4:2018-19 GDP print, pulled down by a sharp deceleration in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) growth to 3.6%, a 14-quarter low, explained possibly at least in part by a hysteresis effect induced by the pre-election uncertainty. Altogether this led to the following considerations at my end regarding the inflation 63. outlook: The broad-based decline in ex-food-fuel inflation is the primary contributor to softening of the inflation trajectory at the horizon of 12 months. While the level of ex- food-fuel inflation is presently at 4.5%, the fact that the level of food inflation is relatively low ensures that the headline trajectory over the next twelve months projected by the RBI staff remains below the MPC target of 4%, reaching 3.7% in Q4:2019-20. Food momentum has picked up significantly; late monsoon and prevailing drought conditions in many states suggest this momentum may sustain beyond just vegetable prices. While vegetable prices show seasonality during April-August that tends to reverse partly during September-March, the reversal pattern is less clear for the food basket as a whole. Nowcast data suggest that momentum in food prices is broad-based in May too, though it has softened from the first fortnight to the second fortnight. Overall, this has imparted an upward push to the food inflation trajectory, more so in the short term. Fuel prices had been rising internationally until the third week of May but have since corrected by over 10% due to the evolving trade war uncertainty and its implications for global demand in a scenario of more than expected supply response. The pass- through to domestic prices has, however, been incomplete. Hence, there is a latent inflation of around 15 basis points that will enter headline inflation if and when passed through; else, if it is absorbed by the government (through lower profits of public sector undertakings) then it will likely get generalised into headline inflation in due course through a higher fiscal deficit. Thus, even as the correction in fuel prices pulls the inflation trajectory down, the incomplete pass-through over the past few months negates some of the decline. 64. In summary, compared to the April 2019 policy, short-term headline inflation trajectory has risen but the 6-to-12-month trajectory has somewhat softened. For a change, I am not comparing this pattern to that observed in the revision of inflation expectations of households or in the survey of professional forecasters as these were received before the release of the Q4:2018-19 GDP print. There is, however, an important upside risk to RBI\u2019s projected inflation trajectory that 65. I wish to highlight in particular \u2013 that of fiscal slippage. 66. Estimates of overall public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) \u2013 which appropriately accounts for extra-budgetary resources and other off-balance sheet borrowings of central and state governments \u2013have now reached between 8% and 9% of GDP1. This is at a level similar to that in 2013 at the time of the \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d crisis. Following are some salient implications: i) While the consolidated fiscal deficit of the center and states might have improved since 2013, the PSBR suggests otherwise. PSBR has risen since 2014 even during high GDP growth years. The rise in PSBR in fact reflects a structural pattern of greater government expenditures and not just cyclical (such as due to weak tax collections from low growth). In other words, there is a significant aggregate demand push linked to government expenditure that needs to be recognised as a source of inflation; in particular, correct economic measurement of the fiscal slippage should factor in the implications of a rising PSBR rather than rely solely on the consolidated fiscal deficit figures. Even the cyclical component of PSBR, such as that in the last year due to lower tax collections, raises the inflation trajectory through an increase in issuance of public debt and country risk premium that feed into imported inflation. Further, PSBR impairs monetary policy transmission due to crowding out effects on market financing through public bonds and on bank deposits through small savings which continue to offer rates that are significantly higher than market yields. This channel bites particularly when the domestic savings rate is on a decline and increases economy\u2019s reliance on external sources of funding. 67. The upcoming Union Budget is, therefore, key to understanding the inflation outlook, especially the response to ongoing distress in the agrarian economy, caused in part by low food prices and reflected in low rural inflation of less than 2% compared to urban inflation that remains above 4%. Would the response worsen the fiscal outlook for next year and beyond, or keep it contained through pursuit of much-needed reforms for the agricultural sector and reduction/rationalisation of other revenue expenditures? Equally importantly, the pattern of PSBR evolution during the rest of 2019-20 would also be critical for assessing the inflation outlook. Hence, the MPC needs to carefully watch out for these fiscal developments. 1 Please see pieces by Sajjid Z Chinoy and Toshi Jain of J.P.Morgan: India\u2019s interim budget tries to strike a balance, but the real story is off-balance sheet; RBI is a close-call next week; India in 2019: still waters run deep 68. Turning to growth, the Q4:2018-19 GDP print has widened the traditional measure of the output gap to be more negative. Several coincident economic indicators for Q1:2019-20, such as consumer durables and non-durables consumption as well as investment activity continue to remain weak. It is to be noted though that my preferred measure of the output gap \u2013 the finance-neutral output gap (FNOG) \u2013 remains closed as (i) aggregate credit growth remains above nominal GDP growth rate; (ii) the impact of past two policy rate cuts will provide fuller transmission to the real sector over the next year; and, (iii) the post-election reduction of financial market uncertainty has led to a softening of the bond yields and a rebound in equity markets in May. In other words, growth has slowed down but financial conditions have eased which should provide a tailwind to growth and help investment activity revive on the back of steadily improving capacity utilisation. Nevertheless, on balance, I concluded that the mixed picture on economic growth has 69. morphed into one where at least some aspects have weakened considerably over the past two quarters. 70. In the April 2019 policy, I had voted to keep the policy rate at 6.25%, whereas the MPC had cut the policy rate to 6%. Counterfactual exercises suggest that under the baseline projections of the RBI, the policy repo rate at 6% is just \"right\" in the short term to achieve MPC's mandated target of 4% headline inflation in the medium term. However, the large decline in ex-food-fuel inflation since the April policy implies some space in these counterfactual exercises to accommodate growth weakness with a policy rate cut of around 20 basis points sometime in the middle of 2019-20. The monsoon uncertainty imparting further spike in food prices and the possibility of vegetable price reversal in winter months turning out to be lower than expected. Not only would this worsen the inflation outlook directly, but potentially also indirectly via the fiscal channel as it would aggravate the agrarian distress. past month even as oil prices have corrected downwards. The fiscal undercurrents impacting the generalized inflation outlook. As also conveyed earlier, I worry especially about a worsening of the PSBR in conjunction with rising oil prices, say due to geopolitical tensions; such a coincidence creates a \u201ctwin deficit\u201d \u2013 fiscal and current account deficits \u2013 scenario for imported inflation, a glimpse of which we have had only recently during H1:2018-19. 72. Let me elaborate on the last of these upside risks. The Indian economy appears to experience \u201ctwin deficit\u201d related vulnerability on a regular basis when external shocks amplify domestic weaknesses. The key to dealing with such a scenario is the ability and the willingness of the central bank to maintain credibility of inflation targeting when imported inflation tends to rise steeply (e.g., due to rising oil prices, widening fiscal and current account deficits, and, in turn, depreciating currency). Since monetary policy response will cool down inflation only with substantive lags, some headroom needs to be maintained in the inflation trajectory below the mandated target so as to absorb the steep rise in imported inflation without the headline moving far away from the target. Similarly, headroom needs to be retained in the policy rate space so as to help revive growth with monetary accommodation once the economy has cooled off and twin deficits reined in. In my assessment, this is exactly the \"robust\" approach that the MPC had adopted during the last year2. 73. Finally, a few words on the trade war uncertainty and India are in order. By not being a significant part of global supply chains in manufacturing, India\u2019s direct exposure to the present correction in global growth is likely to be somewhat muted. Indeed, this consideration has led to India being perceived by investors as somewhat of a \u201csafe haven\u201d economy. Hence, it is my view that growth concerns for India based on moderate trade war concerns are somewhat overstated. A full-scale trade war blowout may, however, result in an emerging markets sell-off by foreign portfolio investors, engulfing India\u2019s external sector and raising prospects of imported inflation, especially if it coincides with a worsening PSBR, and even more perversely, if instead of easing due to weak global growth, oil prices were instead to rise from geopolitical tensions. 74. Counterfactual exercises suggest that a fiscal slippage of 50 basis points (a conservative assessment based on the PSBR estimates) or an oil price increase of 10% leave no space to cut the policy rate below 6%. How should I vote? I found that I was speaking to myself as Santiago, the old 75. fisherman, in \u201cOld Man and the Sea\u201d by Ernest Hemingway: \u201cIt is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes, you are ready.\u201d 76. In spite of my dilemma, I vote \u2013 albeit with some hesitation \u2013 to frontload the policy rate cut from 6% to 5.75% (a 50 basis points rate cut from my April vote to keep the policy rate at 6.25%). This would provide an insurance to help prevent the output gap from widening further or the finance-neutral output gap (FNOG) from turning negative. The MPC will need to remain on guard and be prepared to provide such insurance in a symmetric manner if upside risks to inflation were to materialize. 77. I also vote to change the monetary policy stance from neutral to accommodative. This is because the uncertainty around the upside risks to inflation I have highlighted will resolve only gradually over the next few months and can be factored into future MPC decisions in a data-dependent manner, but seem highly unlikely to lead to a rate hike at the next policy. 78. Since the last MPC meeting in April 2019, greater clarity has emerged about the evolving macroeconomic situation. Overall, there is clear evidence of economic activity losing traction, with the GDP growth in Q4:2018-19 slowing down to 5.8 per cent. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel registered a 20-month low in April 2019 even as the headline CPI inflation evolved broadly along the projected lines. High frequency indicators suggest that the global economy could not sustain the improved performance in Q1:2019 in the face of a sharp slowdown in trade and manufacturing. Consequently, central banks in both advanced and emerging market economies have adopted an accommodative stance in monetary policy. CPI inflation in April 2019 remained unchanged at the previous month\u2019s level of 2.9 79. per cent, though there were significant compositional shifts. Inflation in the food group increased sharply to 1.4 per cent in April 2019 from 0.7 per cent in March, with vegetables 2 Note also that this \u201crobust\u201d inflation-targeting approach is different from an interest-rate defense of the currency; the latter explicitly targets a level of the exchange rate and was ruled out by the MPC in the October 2018 policy. moving out of deflation after nine months. Inflation in the fuel and light group also rose to 2.6 per cent in April from the February low of 1.2 per cent, mainly due to an increase in the prices of liquified petroleum gas following increase in international prices. However, the increase in food and fuel inflation was entirely offset by a sharp decline in inflation in items excluding food and fuel to 4.5 per cent in April from 5.1 per cent in March \u2013 the largest monthly decline since April 2017. The moderation in inflation excluding food and fuel, reflecting weakening of demand conditions, was quite broad-based, spread across several groups like household goods and services, personal care and effects, education and housing. Inflation expectations of households in the May 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey softened further by 20 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon as compared with the previous round, though they remained unchanged for the one-year ahead horizon. Inflation projections have been revised to 3.0-3.1 per cent for H1:2019-20 (up by 10 80. basis points in comparison with the last policy) and to 3.4-3.7 per cent for H2 (down by 10 basis points relative to the last policy), with risks broadly balanced. There are, however, several uncertainties to the baseline inflation path \u2013 the progress of monsoon, unexpected spikes in vegetable prices, international petroleum product prices and their pass-through to domestic prices, volatility in financial markets, and the fiscal situation. 81. Turning to economic activity, the May 31, 2019 data release of the National Statistical Office (NSO) placed GDP growth for 2018-19 at 6.8 per cent, down by 20 basis points relative to its February 28, 2019 estimates. In Q4 of 2018-19, GDP growth decelerated sharply to 5.8 per cent from 6.6 per cent in Q3 and 8.1 per cent a year ago. Though the base effect played some part, growth momentum also slowed down. Investment activity, in particular, decelerated sharply. On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities contracted, while manufacturing activity weakened significantly. Service sector growth remained resilient, though construction activity decelerated markedly. Looking ahead, the forecast of a normal south-west monsoon by India Meteorological 82. Department (IMD) augurs well for agriculture. Even as the third advance estimates of foodgrains production for 2018-19 were lower (by 0.6 per cent) as compared with the previous year, adequate stocks of foodgrains (3.4 times the prescribed buffer norms) provide a backstop against any supply shocks. In the industrial sector, growth in eight core industries decelerated sharply in April. Credit flows from banks to large industries strengthened, though they remained muted for micro and small as well as medium industries. Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector slipped to 75.2 per cent in Q4 from 75.8 per cent in Q3. Growth in imports of capital goods \u2013 a key indicator of investment activity \u2013 remained weak in April. High frequency indicators suggest moderation in activity in the service sector. Sales of commercial vehicles, tractors, passenger cars, and two- and three- wheelers contracted in April. Cement production and steel consumption \u2013 the two key indicators of construction activity \u2013 slowed down in April. Overall imports in April grew at a much faster pace than exports. Projected GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 7.2 per cent in the April policy to 7.0 per cent \u2013 in the range of 6.4-6.7 per cent for H1:2019- 20 and 7.2-7.5 per cent for H2 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced. 83. Over the last few years, the Central Government has by and large followed a policy of fiscal prudence. It has adhered to the fiscal deficit glide path in the last 5 years, though at a somewhat slower pace than committed earlier. Public sector borrowing includes several public sector enterprises which have their own revenue streams to service their debt and take care of their liabilities. Borrowings by such public sector enterprises are mostly for capital expenditure. Hence, such borrowings should be viewed differently. Liquidity in the system turned into surplus in early June after a large injection of 84. durable liquidity by the Reserve Bank in the previous months. The 10-year government securities benchmark yield has declined by about 40 basis points from its average in April 2019 to about 7 per cent. The transmission of the cumulative reduction of 50 bps in the policy repo rate in February and April 2019 to fresh rupee loans has been 21 basis points. However, the weighted average lending rate on outstanding loans has increased by 4 basis points. Going forward, the transmission is expected to improve, given the lags with which banks adjust their deposit and lending rates in response to changes in the policy rate. It is to be noted that quite a sizable part of loan portfolio of banks continues at the base rate, which impedes monetary transmission. Interest rates on small savings are also higher than the prescribed formula. In sum, growth impulses have clearly weakened, while the headline inflation trajectory 85. is projected to remain below 4.0 per cent throughout 2019-20 even after considering the expected transmission of the past two policy rate cuts. Keeping in view the evolving growth- inflation dynamics, there is a need for decisive monetary policy action. Hence, my vote is to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. My vote is also to shift the stance of monetary policy from neutral to accommodative to send a clear signal. ", "Aug_2019": "\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0938 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE The eighteenth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during August 5-7, 2019 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 35 basis points (bps) from 5.75 per cent to 5.40 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands revised to 5.15 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.65 per cent. The MPC also decided to maintain the accommodative stance of monetary policy. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Global economic activity has slowed down since the meeting of the MPC in June 2019, amidst elevated trade tensions and geo-political uncertainty. Among advanced economies (AEs), GDP growth in the US decelerated in Q2:2019 on weak business fixed investment. In the Euro area too, GDP growth moderated in Q2 on worsening external conditions. Economic activity in the UK was subdued in Q2 with waning consumer confidence on account of Brexit related uncertainty and weak industrial production. In Japan, available data on industrial production and consumer confidence suggest that growth is likely to be muted in Q2. 7. Economic activity remained weak in major emerging market economies (EMEs), pulled down mainly by slowing external demand. The Chinese economy decelerated to a multi-year low in Q2, while in Russia subdued economic activity in Q1 continued into Q2 on slowing exports and retail sales. In Brazil, the economy is struggling to gain momentum after contracting in Q1 on weak service sector activity and declining industrial production. Economic activity in South Africa appears to be losing pace in Q2 as the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) contracted for the sixth month in succession in June and business confidence remained weak. 8. Crude oil prices fell sharply in mid-May on excess supplies from an increase in non-OPEC production, combined with a further weakening of demand. Consequently, extension of OPEC production cuts in early July did not have much impact on prices. Gold prices have risen sharply since the last week of May, propelled by increased safe haven demand amidst rising downside risks to growth and a worsening geo-political situation. Inflation remained benign in major advanced and emerging market economies. 9. Financial markets were driven by the monetary policy stances of major central banks and intensifying geo-political tensions. In the US, the equity market recovered most of the losses suffered in May, boosted by dovish guidance by the US Fed and some transient respite in trade tensions with China. EM stocks lagged behind their developed market counterparts, mainly reflecting the weak performance of Chinese and South Korean stocks. Bond yields in the US, which were already trading with a softening bias on increased probability of policy rate cuts, fell markedly in early August on escalation of trade tensions. Bond yields in some more member countries in the Euro area moved into negative territory as expectations of more accommodative monetary policy by the European Central Bank gained traction. In EMEs, bond yields edged lower on more accommodative guidance by systemic central banks. In currency markets, the US dollar weakened against major currencies in June on dovish guidance by the US Fed but appreciated in July. EME currencies, which traded with an appreciating bias in July, depreciated in early August on escalation of trade tensions. 2 Domestic Economy 10. On the domestic front, the south-west monsoon gained intensity and spread with the cumulative rainfall 6 per cent below the long-period average (LPA) up to August 6, 2019. In terms of its spatial distribution, 25 of the 36 sub-divisions received normal or excess rainfall as against 28 sub-divisions last year. The total area sown under kharif crops was 6.6 per cent lower as on August 2 than a year ago. The live storage in major reservoirs on August 1 was at 33 per cent of the full reservoir level as compared with 45 per cent a year ago. Rainfall during the second half of the season (August-September) has been forecast to be normal by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), moderated in May 11. 2019, pulled down by manufacturing and mining even as electricity generation picked up on strong demand. In terms of the use-based classification, the production of capital goods and consumer durables decelerated. However, consumer non-durables accelerated for the third consecutive month in May. The growth in the index of eight core industries decelerated in June, dragged down by a contraction in petroleum refinery products, crude oil, natural gas and cement. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank rose marginally to 76.1 per cent in Q4:2018-19 from 75.9 per cent in Q3; seasonally adjusted CU, however, fell to 74.5 per cent in Q4 from 75.6 per cent in Q3. The Reserve Bank\u2019s business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2019-20 improved marginally, supported by a modest recovery in profit margins of the surveyed firms even as production and order books slowed. The manufacturing PMI rose to 52.5 in July from 52.1 in June, underpinned by a pick-up in production, higher new orders and optimism on demand conditions in the year ahead. High frequency indicators of services sector activity for May-June present a mixed picture. 12. Tractor and motorcycle sales \u2013 indicators of rural demand \u2013 continued to contract. Amongst indicators of urban demand, passenger vehicle sales contracted for the eighth consecutive month in June; however, domestic air passenger traffic growth turned positive in June after three consecutive months of contraction. Commercial vehicle sales slowed down even after adjusting for base effects. Construction activity indicators slackened, with contraction in cement production and slower growth in finished steel consumption in June. Import of capital goods \u2013 a key indicator of investment activity \u2013 contracted in June. The services PMI expanded to 53.8 in July from 49.6 in June on increase in new business activity, new export orders and employment. 13. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, edged up to 3.2 per cent in June from 3.0 per cent in April-May, driven by food inflation, even as fuel inflation and CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated. 14. Inflation in the food group rose to 2.4 per cent in June from 2.0 per cent in May and 1.4 per cent in April, caused by a sharp pick up in prices of meat and fish, pulses and vegetables. Inflation also edged up in cereals, milk, spices and prepared meals. However, inflation in eggs and non-alcoholic beverages softened. Prices of fruits, and sugar and confectionery remained in deflation in June. Inflation in the fuel and light group moderated in June, with electricity moving into 15. deflation. Fuels such as firewood and chips, and dung cake have been in deflation from April. Inflation in liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and subsidised kerosene prices, however, remained elevated. 16. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel fell by 50 basis points to 4.1 per cent in May from 4.6 per cent in April, and remained unchanged in June. The softness in inflation in this category was broad-based across clothing and footwear; household goods and services; transport and communication; and recreation and amusement. Housing inflation remained unchanged over the last three months. Despite some moderation, inflation in the health sub-group remained elevated. Inflation in personal care and effects edged up in June due to a resurgence in gold prices. 17. Inflation expectations of households remained unchanged in the July 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey for the three months ahead horizon as compared with the previous round, but they moderated by 20 basis points for the one year ahead horizon. Input cost pressures from prices of agricultural and industrial raw materials continued to ease in May and June. Nominal growth in rural wages was muted, while growth in staff costs in the manufacturing sector eased in Q1. Manufacturing firms participating in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expect input cost pressures to soften on account of lower raw material costs in Q2. 18. Liquidity in the system was in large surplus in June-July 2019 due to (i) return of currency to the banking system; (ii) drawdown of excess cash reserve ratio (CRR) balances by banks; (iii) open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions; and (iv) the Reserve Bank\u2019s foreign exchange market operations. The Reserve Bank absorbed liquidity of \u20b951,710 crore in June, \u20b91,30,931 crore in July and \u20b92,04,921 crore in August (up to August 6, 2019) on a daily net average basis under the LAF. Two OMO purchase auctions amounting to \u20b927,500 crore were conducted in June, thereby injecting durable liquidity into the system. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 was aligned with the policy repo rate in June, but it traded below the policy repo rate on a daily average basis by 14 bps in July and 17 bps in August (up to August 6, 2019). 19. The transmission of policy repo rate cuts to the weighted average lending rates (WALRs) on fresh rupee loans of banks has improved marginally since the last meeting of the MPC. Overall, banks reduced their WALR on fresh rupee loans by 29 bps during the current easing phase so far (February-June 2019). 20. Merchandise exports contracted in June 2019, weighed down by the subdued performance of gems and jewellery, petroleum products, rice, engineering goods and cotton. After a modest increase in May, imports also contracted in June, impacted by falling prices of petroleum products and reduced imports of pearls and precious stones, transport equipment, machinery, metalliferous ores, chemicals and fertilisers. As the fall in imports was larger than that of exports, the trade deficit declined modestly during May-June on a y-o-y basis. Provisional data suggest a sequential decline in net services exports in May 2019. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment flows moderated to US$ 6.8 billion in April-May 2019 from US$ 7.9 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows in the domestic capital market amounted to US$ 2.3 billion during the current financial year so far (up to August 5, 2019) as against net outflows of US$ 8.5 billion in the same period last year. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 429.0 billion on August 2, 2019 \u2013 an increase of US$ 16.1 billion over end-March 2019. Outlook 21. In the second bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of June 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 3.0-3.1 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.4-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced. The actual headline inflation outcome for Q1:2019-20 at 3.1 per cent was in alignment with these projections. 22. The baseline inflation trajectory for the next four quarters will be shaped by several factors. First, the uptick in food inflation may be sustained by price pressures in vegetables and pulses as more recent data suggest. Uneven spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon could exert some upward pressure on food items, though this risk is likely to be mitigated by the recent catch up in rainfall. Second, despite excess supply conditions, crude oil prices may likely remain volatile due to geo-political tensions in the Middle-East. Third, the outlook for CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remains soft. Manufacturing firms participating in the industrial outlook survey expect output prices to ease in Q2. Fourth, one year ahead inflation expectations of households polled by the Reserve Bank have moderated. Taking into consideration these factors and the impact of recent policy rate cuts, the path of CPI inflation is projected at 3.1 per cent for Q2:2019-20 and 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 3.6 per cent (Chart 1). 23. In the MPC\u2019s June resolution, real GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected at 7.0 per cent \u2013 in the range of 6.4-6.7 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.2-7.5 per cent for H2 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced. Various high frequency indicators suggest weakening of both domestic and external demand conditions. The Business Expectations Index of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey shows muted expansion in demand conditions in Q2, although a decline in input costs augurs well for growth. The impact of monetary policy easing since February 2019 is also expected to support economic activity, going forward. Moreover, base effects will turn favourable in H2:2019-20. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 7.0 per cent in the June policy to 6.9 per cent \u2013 in the range of 5.8-6.6 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.5 per cent for H2 \u2013 with risks somewhat tilted to the downside; GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 7.4 per cent (Chart 2). The MPC notes that inflation is currently projected to remain within the target over a 12- 24. month ahead horizon. Since the last policy, domestic economic activity continues to be weak, with the global slowdown and escalating trade tensions posing downside risks. Private consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand, and investment activity remain sluggish. Even as past rate cuts are being gradually transmitted to the real economy, the benign inflation outlook provides headroom for policy action to close the negative output gap. Addressing growth concerns by boosting aggregate demand, especially private investment, assumes the highest priority at this juncture while remaining consistent with the inflation mandate. 25. the accommodative stance of monetary policy. All members of the MPC unanimously voted to reduce the policy repo rate and to maintain Four members (Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo and Shri Shaktikanta Das) voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 35 basis points, while two members (Dr. Chetan Ghate and Dr. Pami Dua) voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by August 21, 2019. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during October 1, 3 and 4, 2019. Voting on the Resolution to reduce the policy repo rate Since the last review, while there has been no change in the three month ahead inflation 28. expectations of households (7.6%), there has been a decline of 20 bps in the level of one year ahead inflationary expectations (to 7.9%). Households\u2019 current perception of inflation also shows no change at (6.6%). What is noteworthy is that the proportion of respondents (both in the three month and one year buckets) expecting inflation to be less than 6% remains high. The moderation in the one year ahead level of inflationary expectations has happened in spite of rising food inflation in the past couple of months suggesting better anchoring of inflationary expectations. Benign inflation conditions continue to be manifested in CPI-headline (3.2% in June) 29. although it edged up marginally from 3.0% in May. Average inflation in Q1 FY 19-20 (3.1%) is more or less in line with RBI projections made in June (3 percent). Food inflation however has inched up for the seventh consecutive month in June, and food 30. momentum has picked up in April-June. As mentioned in the last Statement, I will remain watchful of how strong the spillovers are from a cyclical seasonal movement (in certain food sub-groups such as vegetables). The realization of such risks could eliminate the \u201cinflation shortfall\u201d currently being projected relative to the medium run target of 4%. 31. In contrast to food inflation, there has been a moderation in inflation ex food and fuel, which continues to be flat at 4.1% in June. The sequential momentum in inflation excluding food and fuel also remains weak. I expect the pick up in economic growth however to put a \u201cfloor\u201d on inflation ex food and fuel. 32. Reflecting benign current and one year ahead inflation conditions in the last several months, the MPC has cut the policy rate by 75 bps (between February 2019 \u2013 June 2019) to close the output gap. I will call this our level policy. Because of previous downward revisions in our inflation and growth projections, our change in stance (in June to accommodative from neutral), and the tone of our resolution and minutes, there has also been a substantial flattening and shifting down of the yield curve. I will call this our slope policy. For instance, the 10 year government bond yield on July 22, 2019 was 6.42 per cent compared to 7.29 per cent on May 20, 2019. Likewise, the 91-day T-Bill rate on July 22 was 5.72% per cent compared to 6.33% per cent on May 20, 2019. Yield spreads on 5 year AAA rated corporate bonds over the 5 year G-Sec yield however increased during mid June and have remained high since then reflecting liquidity problems faced by a few players in the NBFC sector. Taken in unison, our level policy and slope policy already reflect substantial financial accommodation to address the sharp decline in economic growth (from 8.0% in Q1 to 5.8% in Q4) witnessed through FY 2019. 33. I should add that the MPC has enacted both \u201cinsurance-cuts\u201d (to address current and future downside risks to growth) and \u201cdata-dependent\u201d cuts (reflecting the evolving growth-inflation risk picture) in the February-June window. The question then is: what incremental information since the last review warrants a need 34. for further accommodation? There are a few considerations here. 36. worsened leading to some loss in our net export growth. On the external front, growth in the global economy remains tepid. Trade tensions have Domestically, a variety of growth indicators have weakened further. 38. Based on a sample of 843 manufacturing companies, the seasonally adjusted capacity utilization has weakened to 74.5%, which is marginally lower than the long term average and the last few readings. Demand conditions in the manufacturing sector \u2013 based on the Reserve Bank\u2019s analysis of early corporate results of listed companies \u2013 weakened in nominal terms in Q1: 2019- 2020 relative to Q4: 2018-2019. Consumer driven industries also exhibit sluggish demand, with a piling up of inventories. 39. After the March 2019 surge in consumer confidence, this index has declined thereafter with the current situation index back in pessimistic territory. The Reserve Bank\u2019s Business Expectation Index (BEI) expects to lose traction in Q2 2019:2020. IIP growth moderated to 3.1% in May compared to 4.3%. On a positive side though, consumer durable growth moved into positive territory (0.1%); capital goods also moved into positive territory (2.3%); while non durables increased by 7.7%. The output gap has also opened further up since the last review. 40. What is telling is that large swings in the Indian business cycle are still not a thing of the past, despite the adoption of inflation targeting in India. I continue to worry that fiscal imbalances embodied in our large public sector borrowing 41. requirement (roughly 8-9% of GDP) will lead to detrimental outcomes for the economy. While a fiscal glide path should be seen as a limit, once in place, it becomes a target. Convergence to the limit happens, and a form of \u201ccreative accounting\u201d kicks in. Going forward, policy coordination between monetary and fiscal policy will be crucial for a healthier and more durable growth- inflation mix in the economy. For instance, if agents in the economy expect that the government will disregard the level of debt but the central bank follows the Taylor principle (i.e., insists that inflation is not allowed to rise), then the economy can go through a spiral of lower output, higher inflation, and higher debt. 42. I will carefully watch the evolving growth-inflation risk picture. Estimates of economic growth in India have unfortunately been subject to a fair degree of floccinaucinihilipilification. Notwithstanding this, growth is likely to pick up from Q2-Q3: 2019-2020. It should also be highlighted that there has been inadequate monetary transmission given 43. the quantum of past rate cuts: the WALR on fresh rupee loans in the banking system has come down by only 29 bps despite the MPC cutting rates by 75 bps in the February-June window. By a large cut (35 bps) I feel we will be burning through monetary policy space without much to show for it. While the real economy needs some support, we should wait for more transmission to happen. 44. judiciously. Given the evolving growth-inflation risk picture, monetary policy should be used I vote to reduce the policy rate by 25 bps. I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative. 46. Headline inflation, measured by CPI inflation, rose to 3.2% in June 2019 from 3% in May. Food inflation also increased to 2.4% in June from 2% in the previous month, while CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated to 4.1%. Results from surveys provide mixed signals. Inflation expectations of households, as captured through RBI\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of Households, remained unchanged from the last round in May for the three-month-ahead horizon but fell by 20 basis points for the one-year-ahead horizon. At the same time, the Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) showed an expectation of easing of input cost pressures for Q2:2019-20. Upside risks to inflation include continuation of the uptick in food price inflation, uncertainties relating to monsoon, and volatility in international oil prices. 47. Industrial growth, as measured by the index of industrial production, moderated in May to 3.1%, down from 4.3% in the previous month, with manufacturing dropping to 2.5% from 4% and mining slowing to 3.2% from 5.1%. Electricity production, however, grew by 7.4%, up from 6% in April. On the basis of the use-based classification, growth in capital goods, intermediate and primary goods, and infrastructure/construction slowed in the month of May. Consumer durables also decelerated while consumer non-durables accelerated for the third consecutive month. High frequency indicators of rural demand \u2013 tractor and motorcycle sales \u2013 and of urban demand \u2013 passenger vehicle sales \u2013 continued to contract. Growth in the index of eight core industries fell to 0.2% in June due to a contraction in crude oil, cement, natural gas and petroleum refinery products. 48. Meanwhile, the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index increased marginally in July due to an expansion in output, new orders and optimism on demand conditions. The services PMI also grew in July. RBI\u2019s Business Expectations Index of the Industrial Outlook Survey for manufacturing showed modest softening in Q2:2019-20. The Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) conducted by RBI suggests a rise in capacity utilisation to 76.1% in Q4:2018-19, but a fall in the seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation to 74.5% in Q4 from 75.6% in Q3. RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Indices \u2013 Current Situation Index and Future Expectations Index \u2013 reflect a drop in the July round compared to the previous May round, implying lower current activity and a less optimistic outlook. On the trade front, there was a broad based fall in exports (-9.7%) and imports (-9.1%) in June 2019, with import of capital goods dropping by 7.7%. 49. Looking forward, Indian exports growth prospects are fading, according to the Indian Leading Exports Index of the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI). This is consistent with the worsening global industrial outlook underscored by ECRI\u2019s Global Leading Manufacturing Index. Further, growth in ECRI\u2019s U.S. Leading Manufacturing Index has dropped back to December\u2019s seven year low. Growth prospects for U.S. consumer spending are also weakening. Further, ECRI\u2019s U.S. Future Inflation Gauge remains in a cyclical downswing, indicating that the inflation cycle downturn that began in mid-2018 is poised to persist. 8 Further, concerns regarding the global slowdown and the trade tensions between U.S. and 50. China still persist. The monetary policy stance of major central banks has recently been more dovish, tending towards easing of rates. On the domestic front, economic activity has softened due to muted consumption and investment activity, and inflation is benign. While considerable liquidity easing has already occurred and cumulative rate cuts of 75 basis points have been undertaken in the last three MPC meetings (between February and June 2019), along with a change in stance in June from neutral to accommodative, there is still policy space for a further cut in the policy rate, given the weak global and domestic economic scenario and a benign inflation outlook. 51. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) has remained broadly aligned with the policy rate, indicating transmission of the reduction in the policy rate. Policy rate reductions of 75 basis points to other money market rates and G-sec yield have also transmitted fully. 52. At the same time, though the transmission of the policy rate cuts to the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh loans of banks has improved from 21 basis points in February and March to 29 basis points during February to June, it was partial, possibly due to transmission lags associated with monetary policy. Nevertheless, the significant monetary policy easing since February 2019, along with surplus liquidity, are likely to enable more transmission to lending rates, and eventually to the real economy. Further, in view of the shadow banking stress, the importance of surplus liquidity has increased. In this regard, measures taken by the government and the RBI to encourage flow of credit to shadow banks are important confidence building steps. 53. It is also important to recognize that, while monetary policy can impact cyclical factors, it has its limitations with respect to significantly impacting structural factors. Therefore, investment- focused fiscal policy and active continuation of structural reforms are imperative at this juncture to complement the already substantial easing that has been delivered since February 2019. In this context, the directional shift in the Budget towards a lower fiscal deficit target may also contribute towards lowering the cost of capital and boosting investment driven growth. 54. Overall, given that the headline inflation is projected to remain below target in 2019-20, I vote for a pre-emptive rate cut of 25 basis points to enhance consumer confidence and improve investor sentiment. On a cumulative basis, this denotes a policy rate cut of 100 basis points since February 2019, which is sufficient at this point in time. I also vote to keep the stance as accommodative. 55. After the last meeting of MPC in June 2019, several important events have occurred. Inflation readings for May and June 2019 were almost as per the RBI projections. While the Economic Survey 2018-19 provided a growth assessment very similar to the one by RBI, the Union Budget 2019-20 assumed a substantially higher growth rate for the current fiscal year. Monsoon is likely to be normal. Tariff war tensions have further escalated. Oil prices have continued fluctuating within the range I had mentioned in my earlier statements. Growth impulses are, however, weak on the whole and not significantly picking up for substantial revival. It is well recognized in the literature and reiterated by the Economic Survey 2018-19 that investment is a primary driver for economic growth and employment creation. In order to boost investment activities, positive sentiments and business-conducive environment need to be enhanced. It requires carrying out several economic reform measures in the land and labour markets, tariffs of electricity and other resources, and taxation of income and goods and services, besides urgently correcting prevailing high real interest rates in India. While most of these measures are not within the purview of the monetary policy, correction of high real interest rates to a certain extent is. Since I do not see any major threat to inflation in the foreseeable future, I would like to vote for a 35 bps 9 cut in the policy repo rate to correct high real interest rates in order to enhance investment sentiments and revive growth impulses. More specific reasons for my vote are as follows: i) RBI surveys have found that the corporates are now investing more in the financial assets than in the physical assets. Thus, they are turning savers rather than investors. This provides indirect evidence of the adverse impact of high real interest rates prevailing in the economy. Economic reform measures would be more effective if the necessary incentives in terms of costs are there. Fiscal slippage is not a matter of serious concern for the rest of the year, because the Union Budget has maintained the target given in the fiscal consolidation path and the state budgets put together are also not likely to show any serious divergence from the path. iii) The fiscal policy as indicated by the Union Budget 2019-20 on the contrary is on a tighter side rather than expansionary side. The budgeted fiscal deficit this year and projected for the next two years in the medium term strategy paper are very much on the fiscal consolidation path notwithstanding current slowdown and emergence of substantial negative output gap. As I had argued in my statement in the previous MPC meeting, adhering to the fiscal deficit target during a downturn of the business cycle amounts to a tight fiscal policy. It is also corroborated by the increased taxation and maintaining expenditure relative to GDP in the budget. The monetary policy has to, therefore, do its bit to provide the boost to the economy however short-lived it may be, because currently inflation does not appear to be a concern in the next 3-4 quarters at least. iv) Globally, central banks have not only been dovish in their stance but have also cut their policy rates. Inflationary expectations one year ahead by households have been declining and the latest round shows about a 20 bps fall over the previous round. If one outlier city is excluded, the fall is much larger. Similarly the business expectations about headline CPI inflation one year ahead by the IIMA survey shows the expectation of about 3.7 percent, which is very close to the RBI prediction as well. Thus, there is enough policy space to cut the policy repo rate to correct the high real interest rate in the economy. The transmission of the policy rate cuts in the current cycle is likely to take some time because of the lags involved on account of the nature of the banking business. However, under prevailing circumstances, the immediate transmission should be considered not so much in terms of the bank deposit and lending rates but more specific rates influencing new investments such as housing loans, vehicle loans and long term bonds. 56. Given that there is a significant policy space to correct the real rate of interest and thereby helping the economic activities to recover, it is prudent in my opinion to cut the policy rate somewhat aggressively but cautiously keeping some space for future exigencies. As far as the general practice of taking 25 bps as a unit for cutting or raising the policy rate is concerned, there is no logic or scientific basis for it, particularly when we measure inflation rate, GDP growth rate, fiscal deficit percentage, etc. in single decimal. Ideally, there is a case for considering the unit to be 10 bps for cutting or raising the policy rate. I would, therefore, like to cut the policy rate by 40 bps, but I do not mind going with majority opinion of cutting the rate by 35 bps this time, and maintaining the accommodative stance. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 57. business and consumer confidence. This deterioration is getting reflected in inflation outcomes: Since the MPC met in June, the macroeconomic outlook appears to have darkened, denting (a) a pre-monsoon food price build-up was anticipated and it is tracking the seven-year average i.e., the history of the index, in spite of unfavourable base effects \u2013 this suggests that food prices are actually stabilising; (b) pressure points have opened up \u2013 pulses; dairy products; proteins; oils and fats \u2013 but there have been no unruly spikes; moreover, they fall in the remit of supply management policies, since they either reflect sectoral imbalances or cost push factors and nimble steps assume priority in order to prevent price pressures from accumulating; (c) the dynamics of inflation excluding food and fuel warrant concern, especially its broad- based and persisting softness because it seems to be mirroring the weakening of domestic demand. 58. In terms of the technology of monetary policy, the intrinsic link between underlying inflation and the output gap is stark \u2013 the Phillips curve is alive and well in India, notwithstanding some recent loss of faith. This validates the policy actions and a shift in the stance since February 2019. Turning to the state of the economy, virtually every indicator of activity is turning down. 59. Global growth flattered in Q1 of 2019 only to deceive in Q2. Global trade is in contraction. In India, high frequency indicators have focused the narrative on the slowdown in investment, the silence of the animal spirits embodied in the flattening of capital goods production, the absolute decline in capital goods imports and the deceleration in construction activity. What is worrisome though is that other components of aggregate demand could be joining investment in the loss of speed. Private consumption, the bedrock of domestic demand (57 per cent of GDP), is losing momentum in both urban and rural areas. Meanwhile, the deceleration in external demand on account of trade and geopolitical tensions has muted exports and sunk imports into contraction. The fiscal stimulus from the 7th Pay Commission award and one rank one pension (OROP) is fading (0.9 per cent of GDP in 2017-18 and 0.3 per cent in 2018-19); this was expected as the stimulus was in the form of revenue expenditure and the revenue multiplier in India is less than unity. 60. The key issue is: what is the extent of the downturn? This is hard to decipher at this stage \u2013 indicators of global economic activity are flashing amber or red, but there is no recession. Yet, projections of growth are being repeatedly marked down. The number of central banks that have either eased monetary policy or are getting ready to do so has increased, and \u2018insurance\u2019 cuts are becoming visible. 61. In India, negative gaps have opened up in respect of both output and inflation, warranting an appropriate policy response. The issue is: how is the policy headroom to be used? Monetary policy has been proactive and front-loaded as the first line of defence. From here on, the space for monetary policy action has to be calibrated to the evolving situation, especially as the nature and depth of the slowdown is still unravelling and elbow room may be needed if it deepens. A more broad-sided response involving all levers of policy acquires the highest priority now. The overarching goal is to reinvigorate domestic demand and the time to do it is now. On these considerations, I vote for a 35 basis points reduction in the policy rate while 62. persevering with the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Statement by Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo 63. The inflation trajectory has evolved since the June 2019 policy on the expected lines. Among the components, food inflation has turned up, while inflation excluding food and fuel has shown distinct moderation. Reflecting the weak demand conditions as well as lower input costs, the CPI inflation, excluding food and fuel, has seen a moderation of around 100 bps since March 2019. This moderation is broad based. Food inflation on the other hand registered a sharp increase to 2.4 per cent in June from 0.7 per cent in March largely due to a pick-up in prices of vegetables and pulses. Significant inflation pressures continued in meat and fish. Headline CPI inflation in Q1:2019-20 averaged 3.1 per cent, which was close to RBI\u2019s projection of 3.0 per cent made in the June 2019 policy. The three-month ahead inflation expectations of households based on the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey have remained unchanged vis-\u00e0-vis the previous round, while one-year ahead inflation expectations have moderated by 20 bps. Global growth has weakened, and several central banks have adopted more accommodative 64. stance of monetary policy. Domestic growth is also slowing down. A worrisome aspect of the recent growth slowdown is the moderation in private consumption which constitutes the largest segment of aggregate demand. Rural demand indicators like tractor and motorcycle sales continued to contract in May-June. Urban demand indicators, like passenger vehicle sales, contracted for the eighth consecutive month in June. Commercial vehicle sales also contracted during June. Construction activity indicators weakened with contraction in cement production and slower growth in finished steel consumption in June. Import of capital goods \u2013 a key indicator of investment activity \u2013 contracted in June. Q1 growth has been projected to slow down to 5.8 per cent \u2013 the second consecutive quarter of less than six per cent growth. The Business Expectations Index of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, however, shows some moderation in demand conditions in Q2. 65. Cumulative repo rate reduction of 75 bps effected since February 2019 has so far resulted in 29 bps reduction in weighted average lending rate (WALR) of banks on fresh rupee loans. This is considered inadequate even though the transmission is expected to improve, going forward. 66. The projected inflation path suggests that headline inflation is expected to remain below 4 per cent for the next four quarters up to Q1:2020-21. GDP growth projection for 2019-20 has been successively revised down from 7.4 per cent (in February 2019) to 7.2 per cent (in April 2019), 7.0 per cent (in June 2019) and to 6.9 per cent in the 3rd bi-monthly policy of August 2019. 67. Given the benign inflation outlook that is expected to continue for the rest of the year and up to Q1:2020-21, I am of the view that there is a need for monetary policy action to support economic activity and close the output gap. I, therefore, vote for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 35 bps and also keep the stance of monetary policy as accommodative. 68. Economic activity has shown signs of further weakening since the last MPC meeting in June 2019. Several high frequency indicators have either slowed down or contracted in recent months. Headline CPI inflation has evolved broadly along the projected lines; CPI inflation excluding food and fuel continued to soften, while food inflation has edged up. Global economic activity has been losing pace, weighed down by intensifying trade tensions and geo-political uncertainty. GDP numbers for Q2:2019 in respect of some major advanced and emerging market economies have been subdued. Central banks in both advanced and emerging market economies have been increasingly resorting to more accommodative stances of monetary policy. 12 Headline CPI inflation rose to 3.2 per cent in June 2019 from 3.0 per cent in April-May. 69. Food inflation rose by 100 bps in May-June, driven mainly by a pick-up in prices of meat & fish, pulses and vegetables. On the other hand, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated for the fourth consecutive month to 4.1 per cent in June, caused by a broad-based softening across groups, particularly clothing and footwear; household goods and services; and transport and communication. This reflects subdued input cost pressures relating to both agriculture and industrial raw materials and further weakening of domestic demand conditions. Inflation in the fuel and light group also decelerated in May-June, despite the uptick in liquified petroleum gas (LPG) prices. Inflation expectations of households in the July 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey moderated further by 20 basis points for the 1-year ahead horizon, though they remained unchanged for the 3-month ahead horizon. Cumulatively, inflation expectations of households have declined significantly by 180 basis points for the 3-month horizon and 190 basis points for the 1-year horizon in last five survey rounds. This suggests that inflation expectations of households are gradually getting better anchored. Overall, the inflation situation remains benign. CPI inflation has been projected at 3.1 per cent for Q2:2019-20 and 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019- 20, with risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2020-21 has been projected at 3.6 per cent. 70. Turning to economic activity, total area sown under kharif crops was 6.6 per cent lower as on August 2 than a year ago, with significant catching up taking place in recent weeks. Industrial activity continued to be weak in May 2019, impacted mainly by manufacturing and mining. In terms of use-based classification, growth of capital goods and consumer durables decelerated. However, growth of non-durables accelerated in May. The index of eight core industries decelerated in June. Merchandise exports and imports contracted in June. Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation moderated to 74.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19 from 75.6 per cent in Q3. Based on early results of listed companies, demand conditions in the manufacturing sector remained weak in Q1:2019-20, with sales of manufacturing companies contracting by 2.4 per cent (y-o-y), caused mainly by petroleum, automobile and iron and steel companies. On the positive side, the Reserve Bank\u2019s business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2019-20 improved marginally. The manufacturing PMI rose in July, supported by a pick-up in production, higher new orders and optimism on demand conditions in the year ahead. 71. Several high frequency indicators for May-June also suggest weakening of services sector activity. Two key indicators of rural demand, viz., tractor and motorcycle sales, continued to contract. Among indicators of urban demand, while passenger vehicle sales contracted in June, domestic air passenger traffic growth turned positive in June after three consecutive months of contraction. Two key indicators of construction activity, viz., cement production and steel consumption, also contracted/slowed down. Import of capital goods contracted in June, suggesting weakening of investment activity. The services PMI moved into expansion zone in July on increase in new business activity, new export orders and employment. 72. GDP growth for 2019-20 has been revised downwards from 7.0 per cent in the June policy to 6.9 per cent \u2013 in the range of 5.8-6.6 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.5 per cent for H2 \u2013 with some downside risks. GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 7.4 per cent. The impact of monetary policy easing since February 2019 and favourable base effects are expected to support GDP growth, especially in the second half of the year. Liquidity in the system has been in surplus since June 2019 with the surplus absorbed under 73. the reverse repo window of the Reserve Bank being almost `2.0 lakh crore on August 6, 2019. The past policy rate cuts have been fully transmitted to financial markets. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans of banks has declined by 29 bps during the current easing phase so far (February-June 2019). The transmission to bank lending rates has been inadequate, though it is expected to improve in the coming weeks and months. Credit growth has slowed down somewhat in the recent period; credit to micro, small and medium enterprises, in particular, remains anaemic. 74. Overall, there is clear evidence of domestic demand slowing down further. Investment activity has been losing traction. The weakening of the global economy in the face of intensifying trade and geo-political tensions has severely impacted India\u2019s exports, which may further impact investment activity, going forward. Private consumption, which has been the mainstay of domestic demand, has also decelerated. The slowing down of domestic demand is also reflected in significant moderation in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel; and contraction in merchandise imports. 75. In view of weakening of domestic growth impulses and unsettled global macroeconomic environment, there is a need to bolster dwindling domestic demand and support investment activity, even as the impact of past three rate cuts is gradually working its way to the real economy. With headline inflation projected to remain within the target over the next one-year horizon, supporting domestic growth by further reducing interest rates needs to be given the utmost priority. Given the current and evolving inflation and growth scenario at this juncture, it can no longer be a business as usual approach. The economy needs a larger push. I am, therefore, of the view that a reduction in the policy repo rate by conventional 25 bps will be inadequate. On the other hand, a 50 bps rate cut might be excessive and indicate a knee jerk reaction. A policy rate adjustment of 25 bps or multiples thereof may not always be consistent with the evolving macroeconomic situation. Hence, at times it is apposite to calibrate the size of the conventional rate adjustment. Considering these aspects, I vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 35 basis points and for continuing with the accommodative stance of monetary policy. The calibration of the size of the rate cut is expected to reinforce and quicken the impact of (i) the past cumulative rate reduction of 75 basis points; (ii) change in the stance from neutral to accommodative; and (iii) injection of large surplus liquidity in the system. Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager ", "Oct_2019": "The nineteenth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45 ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during October 1, 3 and 4, 2019 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45 ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45 ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and section 45 ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (October 4, 2019) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 5.15 per cent from 5.40 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced to 4.90 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.40 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with an accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s last meeting in August 2019, global economic activity has weakened further. Heightened uncertainty emanating from trade and geo-political tensions continues to cloud the outlook. Among advanced economies (AEs), the slowdown in the US economy in Q2:2019 appears to have extended into Q3:2019, weighed down by softer industrial production. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s index for September indicates that manufacturing slipped further into contraction to touch its lowest reading in a decade; hiring by the private sector also slowed down. In the Euro area too, incoming data suggest that activity may have moderated further in Q3, with retail sales declining and manufacturing PMI remaining in contraction for the eighth consecutive month in September. The UK economy decelerated in Q2; the contraction in industrial production and soft retail sales in July suggest that the loss of speed has continued into Q3 as well. In Japan, the loss of momentum in Q2 spilled over into Q3, albeit cushioned by a fiscal stimulus and frontloaded consumer spending ahead of a planned sales tax hike. 7. The macroeconomic performance of major emerging market economies (EMEs) was weighed down by a deteriorating global environment in Q3. The Chinese economy appears to have slowed down in Q3 as well, with both retail sales and industrial production growth weakening in July-August and exports contracting in August; attention is now focussed on the efficacy of fiscal and monetary policy stimuli in averting a sharper deceleration. In Russia, economic activity ticked up in Q2, though still subdued consumer sentiment and weak industrial production may restrain momentum, going forward. Economic activity in both South Africa and Brazil rebounded in Q2, emerging out of contraction in the previous quarter; however, this nascent recovery faces both domestic and external headwinds. 8. Crude oil prices were pulled down by softer demand, amidst adequate supplies in early August. Prices remained range bound until mid-September when supply disruptions on account of an escalating geo-political conflict resulted in a spike which has abated faster than expected. Gold prices remained elevated on safe haven demand. Central banks became more accommodative with inflation remaining below targets across major AEs and EMEs. Global financial markets have remained unsettled since the MPC\u2019s early August meeting with 9. bouts of volatility unleashed by protectionist policies and worsening global growth prospects. In the US, the equity market\u2019s August losses were recouped by early September \u2013 investor sentiment was buoyed by signs of an easing in US-China trade tensions. Stock markets in EMEs fell, as the strong US dollar led to capital outflows, though they recovered partially in September. Bond yields in the US continued easing till August on growth worries, before a slight uptick was triggered in early September by better than expected US retail sales data and hopes of conciliatory trade negotiations between the US and China. In the Euro area, bond yields sank further into negative territory, propelled by the cut in the deposit rate by the European Central Bank (ECB) to (-) 0.5 per cent and the reintroduction of quantitative easing. In EMEs, bond yields exhibited mixed movements, driven by country-specific factors. In currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against currencies of other AEs. EME currencies, which were trading with a depreciating bias in August, appreciated in early September on country-specific factors and a revival of global risk-on sentiment. On the domestic front, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) slumped to 5.0 per cent in 10. Q1:2019-20, extending a sequential deceleration to the fifth consecutive quarter. Of its constituents, private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) slowed down to an 18-quarter low. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) improved marginally on a sequential basis but remained muted as in the preceding quarter. Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) cushioned the overall loss of momentum to some extent. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) growth decelerated to 4.9 per cent in Q1:2019- 11. 20, pulled down by manufacturing growth, moderating to 0.6 per cent. Agriculture and allied activities were lifted by higher production of wheat and oilseeds during the 2018-19 rabi season. Growth in the services sector was stalled by construction activity. Turning to Q2:2019-20, the initial delay in the onset of the south-west monsoon rapidly caught 12. up from July. By September 30, 2019, the cumulative all-India rainfall surpassed the long period average (LPA) by 10 per cent. The first advance estimates of major kharif crops for 2019-20 have placed production of foodgrains 0.8 per cent lower when compared with the last year\u2019s fourth advance estimates. Looking ahead at the rabi season, the live storage of water in major reservoirs was 115 per cent of the live storage of the corresponding period of the previous year on September 26, 2019 and 121 per cent of average storage level over the last ten years. Abundant rains in August and September have led to improved soil moisture conditions in most parts of the country, particularly central India, compared to the corresponding period of the last year. Overall, the prospects of agriculture have brightened considerably, positioning it favourably for regenerating employment and income, and the revival of domestic demand. 13. Industrial activity, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), weakened in July 2019 (y-o-y), weighed down mainly by moderation in manufacturing. In terms of uses, the production of capital goods and consumer durables contracted. Consumer non-durables, led by edible oils, and intermediate goods, mainly mild steel slabs, posted sustained expansion and have emerged as potential growth drivers. Infrastructure/construction sector activity turned around to register a growth of 2.1 per cent vis-\u00e0-vis (-)1.9 per cent in the previous month. The output of eight core industries contracted in August, pulled down by coal, electricity, crude oil and cement. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the OBICUS (order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey) of the Reserve Bank, declined to 73.6 per cent in Q1:2019-20 from 76.1 per cent in the previous quarter. However, seasonally adjusted CU rose to 74.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20 from 74.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19. Manufacturing firms polled for the industrial outlook survey (IOS) expect capacity utilisation to moderate in Q2:2019-20. The Reserve Bank\u2019s business assessment index (BAI) fell in Q2:2019-20 due to a decline in new orders, contraction in production, lower capacity utilisation and fall in profit margins of the surveyed firms. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for September 2019 was unchanged at its previous month\u2019s level; new orders and employment improved, albeit marginally, and new export orders declined. 14. High frequency indicators suggest that services sector activity weakened in July-August. Indicators of rural demand, viz., tractor and motorcycles sales, contracted. Of underlying indicators of urban demand, passenger vehicle sales contracted in July-August, while domestic air passenger traffic accelerated in August. The sales of commercial vehicles, a key indicator for the transportation sector, contracted by double digits in July-August. Of the two indicators of construction activity, finished steel consumption decelerated sharply in August and cement production contracted. The services PMI moved into contraction in September 2019, dragged down mainly by a decline in new business inflows. 15. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y changes in the CPI, moved in a narrow range of 3.1- 3.2 per cent between June and August. While food inflation picked up, fuel prices moved into deflation. Inflation excluding food and fuel softened in August. 16. Food inflation in August was elevated by a spike in the rate of increase in vegetables prices, a pick-up in pulses inflation and persistently high meat and fish inflation. On the other hand, softer increases in prices of eggs, oils and fats, non-alcoholic beverages and prepared meals, and deflation in prices of fruits and sugar cushioned the rise in overall food inflation. Deflation in the fuel group deepened in August largely due to the pass-through from a sharp 17. decline in international prices of liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Subsidised kerosene prices, however, have been rising in a calibrated manner as oil marketing companies continued a gradual reduction in subsidies. 18. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel increased in July, but its roots were largely confined to prices of personal care and effects \u2013 mainly bullion prices, and transport and communication, reflecting rise in prices of petrol and diesel. By contrast, there was moderation in August, which was spread across most of the sub-groups; however, gold prices spiked further on global uncertainties. 19. The Reserve Bank\u2019s September 2019 round of inflation expectations survey indicates that households expect inflation to rise by 40 basis points over a 3-month ahead horizon and 20 basis points over a one-year ahead horizon, possibly responding adaptively to the rise in food prices in recent months. The Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey shows weak consumer sentiment and tepid consumption demand, especially relating to non-essential items. Manufacturing firms see weakening of demand conditions in Q2:2019-20 and Q3 and expect their output prices to soften, going forward, as the cost of finance and salary outgoes remain muted. 20. Overall liquidity remained surplus in August and September 2019 despite expansion of currency in circulation and forex operations by the Reserve Bank draining liquidity from the system. Net daily average absorption under the LAF amounted to \u20b91,40,497 crore in August, essentially on account of spending by the government, which resulted in availment of ways and means advances (WMA) and intermittent overdraft facilities from the beginning of the month (till August 25, 2019). In September, with a steady build-up of cash balances, particularly with advance tax inflows around September 15, surplus liquidity moderated, and the Reserve Bank undertook daily net absorption of \u20b91,22,392 crore in September. Reflecting easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate (on an average) by 8 basis points (bps) in August and by 6 bps in September. 21. Monetary transmission has remained staggered and incomplete. As against the cumulative policy repo rate reduction of 110 bps during February-August 2019, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans of commercial banks declined by 29 bps. However, the WALR on outstanding rupee loans increased by 7 bps during the same period. 22. Net exports had contributed to aggregate demand in Q1:2019-20 on account of a deeper contraction in imports relative to exports. In Q2, merchandise exports remained weak in July and August 2019, caused by lower shipments of engineering goods, petroleum products, gems and jewellery and cotton yarn. Imports contracted faster during the period mainly due to lower international crude oil prices downsizing the oil import bill and a large fall in the volume of gold imports. Non-oil non-gold imports were pulled down into contraction by coal, pearls and precious stones and transport equipment. These developments led to a narrowing of the trade deficit during July-August 2019. Higher net services receipts and private transfer receipts helped contain the current account deficit to 2.0 per cent of GDP in Q1:2019-20 from 2.3 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment rose to US$ 17.7 billion in April-July 2019 from US$ 11.4 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment (excluding the voluntary retention route) was of the order of US$ 3.3 billion during April-September 2019 as against net outflow of US$ 11.5 billion in the same period of last year. Net disbursals of external commercial borrowings rose to US$ 8.2 billion during April-August 2019 as against net repayments of US$ 0.2 billion during the same period a year ago. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 434.6 billion on October 1, 2019 \u2013 an increase of US$ 21.7 billion over end-March 2019. 23. In the third bi-monthly resolution of August 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 3.1 per cent for Q2:2019-20, 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 3.6 per cent for Q1: 2020-21 with risks evenly balanced. The actual inflation outcomes for Q2 so far (July-August) at 3.2 per cent have been broadly in line with these projections. 24. Going forward, several factors are likely to shape the inflation trajectory. First, the outlook for food inflation has improved considerably since the August bi-monthly policy. Kharif production is estimated at close to last year\u2019s level, auguring well for the overall food supply situation. Vegetable prices may remain elevated in the immediate months but are likely to moderate as winter supplies enter the market. Prices of pulses are expected to remain contained by adequate buffer stocks. Secondly, forward looking surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank point to weak demand conditions persisting, with indications of softening of output prices in Q3:2019-20. Accordingly, price pressures in CPI excluding food and fuel are likely to be muted. Thirdly, crude oil prices may remain volatile in the near-term; while global demand is slowing down, the persisting geo-political uncertainties pose some upside risks to the inflation outlook. Fourthly, three-month and one-year ahead inflation expectations of households polled by the Reserve Bank have risen in the current round reflecting near- term price pressures. Finally, financial markets remain volatile with currencies of several emerging market economies trading with a depreciating bias in the recent period. Taking into consideration these factors and the impact of recent policy rate cuts, the CPI inflation projection is revised slightly upwards to 3.4 per cent for Q2:2019-20, while projections are retained at 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019- 20 and 3.6 per cent for Q1:2020-21, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, real GDP growth for 2019-20 in the August policy was 25. projected at 6.9 per cent \u2013 in the range of 5.8-6.6 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.5 per cent for H2 \u2013 with risks somewhat tilted to the downside; GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 was projected at 7.4 per cent. GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 was significantly lower than projected. Various high frequency indicators suggest that domestic demand conditions have remained weak. The business expectations index of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey shows muted expansion in demand conditions in Q3. Export prospects have been impacted by slowing global growth and continuing trade tensions. On the positive side, however, the impact of monetary policy easing since February 2019 is gradually expected to feed into the real economy and boost demand. Several measures announced by the Government over the last two months are expected to revive sentiment and spur domestic demand, especially private consumption. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 6.9 per cent in the August policy to 6.1 per cent \u2013 5.3 per cent in Q2:2019-20 and in the range of 6.6-7.2 per cent for H2:2019-20 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced; GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 is also revised downwards to 7.2 per cent (Chart 2). 26. The MPC notes that the negative output gap has widened further. While the recent measures announced by the government are likely to help strengthen private consumption and spur private investment activity, the continuing slowdown warrants intensified efforts to restore the growth momentum. With inflation expected to remain below target in the remaining period of 2019-20 and Q1:2020-21, there is policy space to address these growth concerns by reinvigorating domestic demand within the flexible inflation targeting mandate. It is in this context that the MPC decided to continue with an accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. 27. All members of the MPC voted to reduce the policy repo rate and to continue with the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points. Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to reduce the repo rate by 40 basis points. 28. 27. All members of the MPC voted to reduce the policy repo rate and to continue with the accommodative stance of monetary policy.

Dholakia voted to reduce the repo rate by 40 basis points. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by October 18, 2019. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during December 3-5, 2019. Voting on the Resolution to reduce the policy repo rate Since the last review, there has been a 40 bps increase in the three month ahead inflation 30. expectations of households (now at 8%), and a 20 bps increase in the level of one year ahead inflationary expectations (to 8.1%). Households\u2019 current perception of inflation also increased by 50 bps to 7.1%. The proportion of respondents (both in the three month and one year buckets) expecting inflation to be less than 6% has fallen. The uptick in inflationary expectations, while adaptively reflecting the uptick in food inflation, comes on the back of several rounds of declines, and therefore acquires salience. The uptick in food inflation (3% in August) needs to be carefully watched. Vegetable prices 31. have increased by 23.9% during April-August 2019 (compared to 15.7% in the same period last year), reflecting a stronger-than-usual summer uptick. The cumulative momentum in food prices during April-August was also higher (5.5%) compared to the same period last year (3.2%). Pulses inflation has turned positive for the first time since May 2019. The cumulative momentum on items like meat and fish has been higher than earlier occasions. The late exit of the monsoon will however be favorable for Rabi crop growing and should have a mitigating effect on the ongoing uptick in food inflation in the next couple of months. 32. Notwithstanding the uptick in food inflation, headline CPI inflation was almost flat at 3.2%. The August reading for inflation ex food and fuel was lower at 4.2% compared to 4.5% in July. The forward trajectory of inflation ex food and fuel will be influenced by several factors: the pace of growth, favorable base effects, lagged effects of the depreciation in the INR, the price of crude, and the pass-through of inflationary expectations into inflation ex food and fuel. These variables need to be carefully watched. Since the last review, economic activity has continued to weaken. 34. This was manifest most poignantly in the weak Q1 FY19:20 growth numbers (5%) which slowed for a 5th consecutive quarter. Real GVA growth at 4.9% for Q1 FY 19:20 also continued to decline. Consumption demand grew at 3.1%, which is the slowest reading in 4 years. Investment grew at 4%, marginally higher than that in Q4 FY 18:19 which was 3.6%. Since the last review, the output gap has widened further. 35. External demand conditions have worsened. Geopolitical risks remain unresolved. There has been a resurgence of trade policy tensions, and global growth has continued to weaken. Exports contracted in Q1 FY19:20. 36. Domestically, sentiment remains weak. Consumer confidence fell for the 3rd consecutive round. Both the Current Situation Index (CSI) and Future Expectations Index (FEI) produced by the RBI have recorded lower readings compared to the previous round. Based on RBI\u2019s survey of manufacturing activity, real sales growth across 1723 listed private manufacturing companies has become negative for the first time since Q1 FY 16:17. Capacity utilization has also fallen to 73.6% after growing consistently since Q1 FY 18:19. RBI\u2019s Business Assessment Index (BAI) moved into a contraction zone. The Business Expectation Index (BEI) also dipped. However, sales growth remained steady for the non-IT services sector. I worry that weak sentiments may become self-fulfilling, which will complicate the job of monetary policy. 37. On the positive side, July IIP growth was higher at 4.3% compared to the June reading, largely driven by consumer non-durables and intermediate goods. The consumer non-durables segment, which typically proxies for fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), was strong at 8.3% (although influenced by a disproportionate jump in one-off items). However, capital goods contracted (-7.1%). Consumer durables also contracted (-2.7%). What mitigates this is the truncated IIP (i.e., taking out 2 per cent of most volatile components from both sides) which gives rise to a growth in the IIP of 2.4 per cent in July 2019. While there is a divergence in the year on year consumer durable growth number compared to its seasonally adjusted month on month momentum (7.5 % in July), this divergence has to be seen in the backdrop of high year on year growth of 14.1 per cent in July 2018. FDI has picked up in April \u2013 July 2019 relative to 2018. 39. Compared to the last review, monetary transmission has become worse. The decline in the WALR on fresh rupee remained at 29 bps as in the last review. The WALR on outstanding rupee loans has however increased by 7 bps! This is despite the MPC cutting rates by 110 bps in the February- August window. The RBI should be commended for implementing a new set of norms on external benchmarking. This will help with monetary transmission. But as Milton Friedman said, monetary policy works with long and variable lags. In the Indian case, these lags are made worse by frictions in the banking system, complicating the MPC\u2019s efforts to implement counter-cyclical policy. I strongly feel that we need a more informed discussion of fiscal policy in India. While the 40. government should be commended for implementing a new corporate tax rate regime, based on the discussion that I read, I find it premature, without a proper \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d analysis, to speculate on the impact of the tax cut on the fiscal deficit, what part of the economic effects will be on the demand side, and what part will be on the supply side. 41. In some of my own research with co-authors, we show that an impact of a corporate tax cut on GDP in an emerging market economy like India may not be very large. It leads to a rebalancing of the economy away from consumption and towards investment (which is why the GDP effects are muted). Overall, the tax cut leads to a decline in the fiscal deficit in the long run, although the size of this effect is negligible. The lowering impact on the fiscal deficit however depends on a very strong investment effect from the tax cut, which may not happen in the current economic climate. Given the above, what is the appropriate path of monetary policy? 43. There is always a tension between pro-active risk management and being data dependent. Growth impulses however continue to be weak. Given this, the MPC has been pro-active in adjusting policy as reflected in the quantum of past rate cuts. Monetary policy however cannot be a permanent form of stimulus. As Lawrence Lindsey says in his book, The Growth Experiment Revisited (Basic Books, 2013) \u201cMonetary policy should lean against the wind and help stabilize the business cycle. But it cannot become the wind itself, particularly one that blows at gale force.\u201d 44. I vote to reduce the policy rate by 25 bps. I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative. I will remain data dependant, going forward; further monetary policy action will depend on the evolving growth-inflation dynamics. 45. Headline inflation, measured by CPI inflation, fell from 3.2% in June 2019 to 3.1% in July but rose back to 3.2% in August. Food inflation increased from 2.4% in June to 3% in August, mainly due to an increase in inflation in vegetables, pulses, and elevated inflation in meat and fish. Inflation excluding food and fuel rose from 4.1% in June to 4.5% in July, partly reflecting the increase in prices of petrol and diesel, but softened to 4.2% in August. 46. Looking forward, inflation expectations of households, as captured through RBI\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of Households, increased in the September 2019 round, compared to the July round, by 40 basis points for the three-months-ahead horizon and by 20 basis points for the one-year- ahead horizon, possibly due to the recent increase in food prices. At the same time, the Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) shows an expectation of selling prices of manufacturing being muted in Q3:2019-20. Further, according to Economic Cycle Research Institute\u2019s (ECRI) Indian Future Inflation Gauge, which is a predictor of the direction of future inflation, inflation pressures remain contained. Thus, while the actual inflation scenario and the outlook for inflation seem benign, some 47. upside risks are prevalent, such as the possibility of supply disruptions in the global crude oil market. 48. On the output side, GDP growth fell for the fifth consecutive quarter to 5% in Q1:2019-20 from 5.8% in the previous quarter. Growth in private final consumption expenditure dropped to an 18- quarter low of 3.1% in the same period, while growth in gross capital formation remained muted at 3.7%. Growth in GVA also fell to 4.9% in Q1:2019-20 from 5.7% in Q4:2018-19, mainly due to a moderation in manufacturing growth and stalling of construction activity. 49. Industrial activity recorded moderate growth, with growth in IIP increasing from 1.2% in June to 4.3% in July, and with sub-indices for mining and quarrying, manufacturing and electricity registering positive growth, although growth in electricity slowed. Use based classification, however, indicates continuing deceleration in capital goods. Consumer non-durables accelerated for the fourth consecutive month, while for consumer durables, growth remained negative, although there was some improvement with growth rising from (-) 10.2% in June to (-) 2.7% in July. High frequency indicators of rural demand \u2013 tractor and motorcycle sales \u2013 and of urban demand \u2013 passenger vehicle sales \u2013 continued to contract. Growth in the index of eight core industries also fell in August. 50. Turning to survey data, RBI\u2019s Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) suggests a drop in capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector to 73.6% in Q1:2019-20 from 76.1% in the previous quarter, while seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation increased marginally to 74.8% in Q1 from 74.5% in Q4:2018-19. RBI\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey for the manufacturing sector shows a decline in the Business Assessment Index (a composite of demand indicators) for Q2:2019-20. The corresponding Business Expectations Index suggests that demand conditions are also expected to deteriorate in Q3:2019-20. According to RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey, the Current Situation Index and the Future Expectations Index both dropped in the September round, implying lower current activity and a less optimistic outlook. Meanwhile, the manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index remained unchanged in September from the previous month, while the services PMI fell in September. 51. sentiment are somewhat downbeat. Thus, private consumption and investment activity are weak, and business and consumer 52. On the global front, the U.S. economic growth outlook is increasingly getting weaker, especially in manufacturing, and job growth prospects have dimmed. This boosts the probability of more Fed rate cuts this year. The overall global growth outlook also remains downcast, according to ECRI\u2019s 20-Country Long Leading Index. In particular, Japan\u2019s latest sales tax hike risks tipping the economy into its fifth recession since 2008. Meanwhile, Chinese economic growth is likely to languish. According to ECRI\u2019s Chinese Leading Industrial Production Index, this is especially true in the industrial sector, hurting supplier countries like Germany, which is heavily reliant on exports to China. At the same time, industrial growth seems to have hit bottom in France and Italy earlier this year. Nevertheless, in the context of largely gloomy international growth prospects, ECRI\u2019s Indian 53. Leading Exports Index growth rate remains in a cyclical downswing, suggesting that Indian export growth will stay weak. Thus, the global scenario is not likely to provide impetus to domestic growth. 54. With respect to transmission, between February and August 2019, the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate has been 110 basis points, much of which is yet to be transmitted, although the financial markets have taken cognizance. While the importance of transmitting existing rate cuts before committing to fresh ones cannot be overstated, the recent linking of lending rates to external benchmarks is expected to expedite the process. 55. Of course, the policy heavy-lifting to reverse the growth slowdown has to be a multi-pronged approach. In this regard, there is a welcome delivery of a number of measures undertaken by the government since the last policy meeting with a focus on reviving growth. Among largely fiscal- neutral measures, the government has taken steps to relax norms for FDI, focus on seamless tax administration, improve ease of doing business, consolidate public sector banks, and encourage the flow of credit from the banking sector to the NBFCs and real economy sectors. The government has also undertaken fiscal stimulus in the form of a major overhaul in corporate income tax aimed at reducing the overall tax burden on corporates and in turn improving India's global competitiveness. 56. Given the measures undertaken by the government to address the growth slowdown, as well as the pending transmission of monetary policy, there is merit in a wait-and-watch approach to see how these measures pan out and impact real economy activity, going forward. At the same time, given the slowdown in growth on the domestic and global fronts, along with benign headline inflation and the expectation that it will remain below target, there is policy space to further cut the policy repo rate to boost domestic growth, within the flexible inflation targeting mandate. 57. Thus, on balance, the growth-inflation dynamics call for another 25 basis points cut, bringing the cumulative easing this year to 135 basis points. I therefore vote for a policy rate cut of 25 basis points. I also vote to keep the stance as accommodative. 58. Macroeconomic data coming in after the last meeting of MPC in August 2019 have further confirmed our serious concerns about the growth slow-down with continued benign inflation outlook. Compared to the expectation of 5.8% of real GDP growth during the first quarter of the current year 2019-20, the official estimate of the growth turned out to be far less at 5.0%. While we cannot rule out the possibility of the figure getting revised marginally upward by 10-20 bps, significant undershooting of the growth during Q1-2019-20 has to be recognized. In spite of late efforts by RBI and the Central Government to provide respectively the monetary and fiscal boost, it appears that growth recovery may take longer than expected. In fact, RBI has now revised its growth prediction for the current year 2019-20 substantially downward by 80 bps compared to the August meeting of MPC. Prediction about inflation rate, on the other hand, has been fairly stable and well below the target of 4%. As per the mandate given to the MPC by the Act under such circumstances, the growth concerns have to be addressed. In my opinion, we need to maintain accommodative stance with possible rate action till growth recovers provided the inflation remains within the target. At this juncture, I would like to act more aggressively by reducing the policy Repo Rate further by 40 bps so as to correct the real interest rates in the economy in due course. It would still leave some space for the rate action if required in future. More specific reasons for my vote are as follows \u2013 i) High frequency data on indicators for estimating quarterly growth suggest that the growth slow- down may continue in the second quarter of 2019-20. Any substantial recovery is likely only in the Q3 of 2019-20. This is because, the impact of corporate tax cut particularly for the new enterprises and good monsoon will be kicking off from the third quarter of the current year. As a result, the output gap would continue to be negative for at least next 3 to 4 quarters leading to downward pressures on the CPI excluding food and fuel. Food inflation is likely to remain muted in the face of good monsoon with better Rabi season. While some vegetables and fruits may experience spikes during the year, they are not likely to result in permanent high prices. Fuel prices also do not show an average expectation to rise substantially. In fact, all indications suggest fluctuating oil prices around $58-65 range on a sustained basis. Thus, inflation rate crossing the mid-point target of 4% during the next year or so has very little probability. This is also supported by the inflationary expectation of businesses on the headline CPI inflation one year ahead of 3.70% as per the latest IIMA survey. Although RBI\u2019s own survey of household inflationary expectation shows a rise of 20 bps one year ahead, it is likely to have been influenced by the food price hike before the survey. RBI\u2019s own prediction of the headline inflation by Q1-2020-21 has remained the same at 3.6%. This generates substantial space for a rate cut to further correct the high real interest rate and encourage investment. The Economic Survey 2018-19 has argued with empirical support that, while the household savings in India are determined by the growth of income and demography and not so much by the high real interest rate, the private investment is significantly and negatively related to the real interest rate. In my opinion, this is an important finding for the current situation. Whereas most comparator countries have their real policy rates around zero percent, our real policy rate is around 1.8 to 2 percent. Correcting high real interest rates can go a long way to revive the economy from the slow growth. In my opinion, concerns about likely slippage of the combined deficit during this year are misplaced as I have argued earlier. In any case, the overall impact of all current announcements on the combined fiscal deficit as per my calculation is likely to be hardly 10 to 20 bps assuming the GST revenues are as per the budgeted target. It should not have any serious adverse impact on the inflation. 59. External bench-marking of the lending rates by the banks would result in better transmission now. Corporate bond market reforms by allowing entry to corporates with lower rating than AAA; encouraging issuance of long term bonds and creating a proper yield curve for the government bond market to serve as a bench-mark can go a long way to deepen the market and improve the transmission. While such reforms are urgently required, they should not constrain the rate action by RBI. In my opinion, enough space exists as argued above for a 40 bps reduction in the policy repo rate now with space still existing for future till growth recovers. Hence, I vote for continuing with accommodative stance and cut the policy repo rate by 40 bps now. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 60. The GDP print for the first quarter of 2019-20, high frequency indicators for the second quarter up to August, the indicators that have become available for September such as auto sales of industry majors, bank credit, the lowest GST collections in 19 months, and the wide swathe of downgrades of projections suggest that the downturn in the economy, and especially in spending, may be deeper and more pervasive than expected. This justifies the pre-emptive accommodative stance adopted by the MPC since February 2019. Headwinds from the global slowdown are also stronger than initially envisaged, and broader in their impact on domestic activity: transmitted through trade, they seem to be active in muting industrial activity and investment across borders. Sensing this, business expectations for the third quarter and consumer confidence over a year ahead have moderated from their earlier readings. This pronounced cyclical downswing suggests that the state of the economy will likely get worse before it gets better. 61. Meanwhile, inflation continues to trail below target and is projected to remain so over the 12 months ahead horizon. Its underlying dynamics excluding food and fuel seem to be mirroring the growing slack in the economy, given the succession of soft readings and the broad-based nature of its ebbing. If one-off factors like gold prices are excluded, inflation excluding food and fuel falls below target. Although inflation expectations of households a year ahead have ticked up, they are essentially adapting to the firming up of food prices in the summer. Businesses are anticipating modest input cost pressures but still lack pricing power, rendering the outlook on selling prices benign. The conduct of monetary policy requires as accurate as feasible a sense of the economy\u2019s 62. potential output, given that is unobservable. This enables an assessment of the state of the output gap \u2013 the difference between actual and potential output \u2013 so as to gauge where the economy is positioned on the business cycle. Accordingly, monetary policy can perform its stabilisation or countercyclical role that is appropriate to the situation. The lament of the monetary policy wielder has been that potential output is notoriously difficult to estimate. But, amidst the evolving configuration of macro- fundamentals in India, actual output itself and its future path are overcast with high uncertainty. Consequently, the extent of the slack in the economy due to deficient demand is obscure, although that input is vital for setting the monetary policy stance. 63. In this challenging environment, my call would be for prudence rather than being data- dependent. In its counter-cyclical role, monetary policy has to be pre-emptive in addressing the negative gaps \u2013 inflation below target, and output below potential \u2013 that seem to be developing some persistence. Available space for policy action has to be calibrated to secure the closure of the gaps. 64. The outlook is fraught with downside risks, but the prospects for agriculture have brightened and along with industry\u2019s inventory restocking requirements in the festival season, scope opens up for reviving spending. In this endeavour, interest rate smoothing is the preferred approach: reinforcing the policy intent with successive steps so as to obviate monetary policy surprises; nudging transmission to bank deposit and lending rates with repetitive but calibrated policy actions in the same direction that also offset the risk premium that appears to be building up in several sectors of the economy. 65. In my minutes at the time of the June 2019 meeting of the MPC, I had emphasised that while monetary policy is taking the lead as the first line of defence, a full throttle effort by all arms of macroeconomic management is the need of the hour. Over recent weeks, monetary and fiscal actions have been undertaken, and it is important to buttress this coordinated endeavour. 66. Accordingly, I vote for a 25 basis points reduction in the policy rate while maintaining an accommodative policy stance until economic activity in India is reinvigorated and firmly on the path of recovery. 67. GDP growth at 5 per cent for Q1 of 2019-20 was a surprise as it significantly undershot the Reserve Bank\u2019s projection of 5.8 per cent. This is particularly a cause of concern because it was caused by a sharp slowdown in private consumption expenditure. Investment activity remained weak, and exports contracted reflecting weak global demand. Growth continued to lose momentum in Q2 as reflected in high frequency indicators. Industrial production growth moderated in July relative to the corresponding month of last year mainly due to sluggish manufacturing activity. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector declined in the last round of the RBI\u2019s survey. The core sector contracted in August. PMI manufacturing remained unchanged in September. Information gleaned through the forward-looking surveys of the RBI indicate deterioration in the industrial outlook in Q2 with downbeat expectations for Q3, especially relating to production, new orders and employment. 68. Most services sector indicators relating to rural and urban demand, transport and construction activity declined/contracted in July-August. PMI services slipped into contraction zone in September 2019 due to a decline in fresh orders. 69. The silver lining in the evolving growth dynamics was provided by agriculture, supported by a sharp catch up in rainfall after a delayed start. The first advance estimates of kharif crops are broadly comparable with those of the last year (fourth advance estimates). The live storage of water in major reservoirs at 121 per cent of the average storage level over the last ten years bodes well for agriculture and rural incomes. CPI inflation remained soft in July-August, though there was a pick-up in food inflation, as 70. expected. Food prices are likely to moderate once new kharif crops arrive in the market. Fuel inflation moved deeper into deflation reflecting the decline in prices of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) in the international market. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel continued to soften reflecting possibly the slowdown of economic activity. Inflation expectations of households increased during the latest round of RBI\u2019s survey, in response to the recent rise in food inflation. CPI inflation projection has been revised marginally upwards for Q2 of 2019-20 at 3.4 per cent (as against 3.1 per cent projected at the time of the August 2019 policy) but has been retained for other quarters as in the August policy \u2013 3.5- 3.7 per cent for the second half of 2019-20 and 3.6 per cent for the first quarter of 2020-21. 71. The cumulative repo rate reduction of 110 bps effected since February 2019 has resulted in 29 bps reduction in weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans till August, which is much lower than expected. However, with the adoption of external benchmarking in pricing of loans by banks for lending to SME and personal loans effective October 1, 2019, monetary transmission is expected to improve. To summarise, the slowdown of GDP growth in the recent period has been underpinned by 72. deficient domestic demand. The recent measures initiated by the government should be helpful in supporting domestic demand, especially investment. While the impact of past policy rate cuts by the MPC is expected to transmit to the real sector gradually, there is a need to reinforce the past monetary policy measures and the recent steps taken by the government in supporting domestic demand. As inflation is projected to remain below the target of 4 per cent till the first quarter of 2020-21, policy space is available to support growth. I, therefore, vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 25 bps and continue with an accommodative monetary policy stance until the economy is on a revival path, within the mandate of flexible inflation targeting. 73. Economic activity has weakened further since the last MPC meeting in August 2019 with growth for Q1:2019-20 turning out to be 5 per cent. Various high frequency indicators show that economic activity remained weak in Q2. Inflation has evolved broadly along the projected lines and remains benign; while food inflation has edged up further in the last two months reflecting the sharper than expected increase in food prices, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has moderated consistent with the slowing down of the economy. The global economy continued to lose traction with high frequency indicators in both the advanced and emerging market economies weakening further in Q3:2019, dragged down by escalating trade tensions and rising geo-political uncertainties. Central banks across the advanced and emerging market economies have adopted more accommodative stances of monetary policy to bolster their economies. 74. Headline CPI inflation edged up marginally in August, driven by an upward movement in food inflation reflecting the sharp summer uptick in prices of vegetables and a pick-up in pulses inflation. The increase in prices of vegetables this year was higher than that in last two years, but it was still in line with the long-term average. Fuel inflation moved further into deflation caused by a decline in prices of liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Inflation excluding food and fuel moderated in August, reversing the increase in the previous month; the moderation was broad-based, which more than offset the sharp increase in gold prices. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated by around 90 bps between March and August 2019. Inflation expectations of households in the September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey increased by 40 basis points for a 3-month ahead horizon and 20 basis points for a 12-month ahead horizon. Overall, the near-term inflation scenario remains subdued; CPI inflation projections have been revised slightly upwards to 3.4 per cent for Q2:2019-20 but have been retained at 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 3.6 per cent for Q1:2020-21, with risks evenly balanced. 75. Moving on to economic activity, real GDP growth moderated to 5 per cent in the first quarter of 2019-20 as against the projection of 5.8 per cent made in the August policy. Private consumption declined even as investment demand remained weak. The slowdown in industrial activity that began in Q2:2018-19 accentuated further in Q1:2019-20 with manufacturing growth moderating to 0.6 per cent. High frequency indicators suggest that economic activity remained weak in Q2:2019-20. Industrial production growth decelerated in July 2019 in comparison with the same month of last year, while the output of eight core industries contracted in August. The slowing domestic demand was also reflected in shrinkage in non-oil non-gold imports in July-August. The manufacturing PMI for September 2019 was flat. High frequency indicators suggest that services sector activity also remained weak in July- August. Key indicators of both rural demand, viz., tractors and motor cycles sales, and urban demand such as passenger vehicles sales contracted in July-August. 76. On the positive side, the first advance estimates of major kharif crops for 2019-20 are broadly in line with the last year\u2019s fourth advance estimates. More importantly, the prospects for the rabi 2019-20 season have brightened with the improved position of the live storage of water in major reservoirs. This portends well for the farm sector, and the revival of rural demand. Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation in the manufacturing improved marginally from 74.5 per cent in Q4:2018-19 to 74.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20 in the last round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey. This was close to the long-term average, reflecting intensive use of existing capacities. Real GDP growth for 2019-20 has now been revised downwards from 6.9 per cent in the August policy to 6.1 per cent \u2013 5.3 per cent in Q2:2019-20 and in the range of 6.6-7.2 per cent for H2:2019-20 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced; GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 has also been revised downwards to 7.2 per cent. 77. Overall liquidity in the system remained in surplus in August and September. However, monetary transmission has remained weak. As against the cumulative policy repo rate reduction of 110 bps during February-August 2019, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans of commercial banks declined by 29 bps. The WALR on outstanding rupee loans, in contrast, increased by 7 basis points. However, with the external benchmark framework coming into force from October 1, the transmission is expected to improve in the coming weeks and months. 78. Overall, domestic demand has moderated significantly. The weakening of private consumption, which for long has been the bedrock of aggregate demand, in particular, is a matter of concern. Private investment has also lost traction, with the corporate sector reluctant to make fresh investments even though capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector has operated close to the long-term average in the recent period. The unsettled global environment in the face of rising trade tensions has impacted India\u2019s exports, besides delaying the revival of private investment by creating uncertainty. In this environment, it is important to focus on strengthening domestic demand. The MPC has cumulatively reduced the policy repo rate by 110 basis points since the February 2019 policy and changed the stance from neutral to accommodative in the June policy. Systemic liquidity has been in surplus since June 2019. As stated earlier, the introduction of lending rates linked to an external benchmark should result in better monetary transmission. 79. The government has also initiated several measures in recent months which, together with monetary easing by the Reserve Bank, are gradually expected to work their way through the real economy. At the same time, continuing slowdown of the economy requires all out efforts to strengthen private consumption and investment. There is also a need to be watchful of the fiscal situation; however, the government has indicated that it would maintain the fiscal deficit. As the inflation scenario remains benign with headline inflation projected at below target in the remaining period of 2019-20 and Q1:2020-21, there is policy space to address growth concerns. Hence, I vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. With this, the policy repo rate would cumulatively stand reduced by 135 basis points in eight months. I also vote for persevering with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. This enhanced forward guidance on the stance of monetary policy should strengthen monetary transmission and support the real economy. ", "Dec_2019": "The twentieth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during December 3 to 5, 2019 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 5, 2019) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 5.15 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 4.90 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 5.40 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting in October 2019, global economic activity has remained subdued, though some signs of resilience are becoming visible. Among the advanced economies (AEs), GDP growth in the US picked up in Q3 on strong private investment and personal consumption expenditure. More recent data, however, indicate that factory activity contracted for the fourth consecutive month in November, while retail sales and industrial production declined in October. In the Euro area, GDP growth remained stable in Q3 relative to the previous quarter on improved household consumption and government spending, although manufacturing activity continued lingering geo-political uncertainties. With weak global demand pulling down exports, the Japanese economy lost momentum in Q3. Economic activity in the UK accelerated in Q3, primarily driven by the services sector and construction activity. to struggle with 7. Among emerging market economies (EMEs), GDP growth in China decelerated further in Q3, reflecting weak industrial production and declining exports amidst trade tensions with the US. While retail sales edged lower in October, fiscal and monetary stimuli are expected to temper the slowdown. In Russia, GDP growth accelerated in Q3 on the back of an upturn in agricultural output and industrial activity. In South Africa, economic activity contracted in Q3, pulled down by slowing mining and manufacturing activity. In Brazil, GDP growth accelerated further in Q3, driven by agriculture, industry and business investment activity. Crude oil prices have moved in a narrow range in both directions since the last 8. meeting of the MPC, reflecting changing sentiments relating to progress in US-China trade talks. Gold prices traded sideways before falling in early November as a revival of risk appetite eased safe haven demand. Inflation remained benign in major AEs and EMEs in Q3, except in China where it firmed up to its highest level in eight years. 9. Global financial markets were buoyed in October by risk-on sentiment stemming from renewed optimism on a trade truce between the US and China and possibility of a Brexit deal. In the US, equity markets rallied in this environment, also supported by better than expected corporate earnings and strong jobs data. Stock markets in EMEs too registered gains in October before some selling pressure took hold in the second half of November on renewed fears of US-China trade talks stalling on the Hong Kong stand-off. Bond yields in the US firmed up from early October on risk-on sell-offs; however, they softened from mid- November on waning hopes of a near-term resolution of trade disputes. Bond yields in the Euro area remained negative, but expectations that a no-deal Brexit is less likely improved sentiment. In EMEs, bond yields showed mixed movements, driven initially by optimism on US-China trade talks and country-specific factors. In currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, while EME currencies have been trading with an appreciating bias. 10. On the domestic front, gross domestic product (GDP) growth moderated to 4.5 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2019-20, extending a sequential deceleration to the sixth consecutive quarter. Real GDP growth was weighed down by a sharp slowdown in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), cushioned by a jump in government final consumption expenditure (GFCE). Excluding GFCE, GDP growth would have been at 3.1 per cent. Growth in real private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) recovered from an 18-quarter trough. The drag from net exports eased on account of a sharper contraction in imports than in exports. 11. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) growth decelerated to 4.3 per cent in Q2:2019-20, pulled down by a contraction in manufacturing. The slowdown in manufacturing activity was also reflected in a decline in capacity utilisation (CU) to 68.9 per cent in Q2:2019-20 from 73.6 per cent in Q1 in the early results of the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS). Seasonally adjusted CU also fell to 69.8 per cent from 74.6 per cent during the same period. Growth in the services sector moderated, weighed down mainly by trade, hotels, transport, communication, broadcasting services and construction activity. However, growth in public administration, defence and other services accelerated in line with the surge in government final consumption expenditure. Agricultural GVA growth increased marginally, despite contraction in kharif foodgrains production in the first advance estimates. 12. Looking beyond Q2, rabi sowing is catching up from the setback caused by delay in kharif harvesting and unseasonal rainfall in October and early November. By November 29, it was only 0.5 per cent lower than the acreage covered a year ago. North-east monsoon precipitation was 34 per cent above the long-period average up to December 4. Storage in major reservoirs, the main source of irrigation during the rabi season, was at 86 per cent of the full reservoir level as on November 28 as compared with 61 per cent in the same period a year ago. 13. Contraction in output of eight core industries \u2013 which constitute 40 per cent of the index of industrial production (IIP) \u2013 extended into the second consecutive month in October and became more pronounced, dragged down by coal, electricity, cement, natural gas and crude oil. However, output of fertilisers rose sharply, reflecting expectations of robust sowing activity in the rabi season. According to the early results of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, overall sentiment in the manufacturing sector remained in pessimism in Q3:2019-20 due to continuing downbeat sentiments on production, domestic and external demand, and the employment scenario. The purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for manufacturing increased from 50.6 in October to 51.2 in November 2019, driven up by an increase in new orders and output. 14. High frequency indicators suggest that service sector activity generally remained weak in October. Tractors and motorcycles sales \u2013 indicators of rural demand \u2013 continued to contract but at a moderated pace; however, passenger vehicle sales \u2013 an indicator of urban demand \u2013 posted a slender positive growth in October after 11 months of decline, reflecting festival season demand and promotional measures by auto companies. Commercial vehicle sales and railway freight traffic contracted. The PMI for services remained in negative zone in October (49.2) due to a decline in new export business and turning down of business expectations. However, it moved into expansion zone to 52.7 in November on a pick-up in new business. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y changes in the CPI, increased sharply to 4.6 per 15. cent in October, propelled by a surge in food prices. Fuel group prices remained in deflation, while inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel moderated further from its level a month ago. 16. Turning to the drivers of CPI, food inflation spiked to 6.9 per cent in October \u2013 a 39- month high \u2013 pushed up by a sharp increase in prices of vegetables due to heavy unseasonal rains. Prices of onions, in particular, shot up by 45.3 per cent in September and further by 19.6 per cent in October. Inflation in several other food items such as fruits, milk, pulses and cereals also increased, reflecting diverse factors \u2013 the cost push of fodder prices in the case of milk; decline in production and sowing area of pulses; and minimum support price effects. Sugar and confectionery prices moved out of deflation in October as sugarcane output shrank on a y-o-y basis. Fuel group prices remained weak for the fourth consecutive month in October due to 17. deflation in prices of LPG, firewood and chips. Electricity prices, however, picked up in October following a rise in user charges by power distribution companies (DISCOMs) across 13 states as reflected in the CPI. 18. Inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel softened further from 4.2 per cent in September to 3.4 per cent in October, primarily due to favourable base effects. Price increases also moderated across several services as reflected in transportation fares, telephone charges, tuition fees and house rentals. 19. Households\u2019 inflation expectations, measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s November 2019 round of the survey, increased by 120 basis points over the 3-month ahead horizon and 180 basis points over the 1-year ahead horizon as they adapted to the spike in food prices in recent months. Based on the Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey, spending on non-essential items of consumption has shrunk compared to a year ago; however, consumers expect their overall spending to remain unchanged going forward largely due to an increase in prices. Manufacturing firms polled in the industrial outlook survey of the Reserve Bank expect (i) weak demand conditions and reduced input price pressures in Q3:2019-20 and Q4; and (ii) muted output prices reflecting further weakening of pricing power. Overall liquidity in the system remained in surplus in October and November 2019 20. despite an expansion of currency in circulation due to festival demand. Average daily net absorption under the LAF amounted to \u20b91,98,566 crore in October. The Centre availed of ways and means advances (WMA) in the first week and the last three days of the month to fund its expenditure. In November, the average daily net absorption of surplus liquidity soared to \u20b92,40,566 crore with more frequent and larger recourse to WMA by the Government. Consequently, the Reserve Bank decided to conduct longer-term variable rate reverse repo auctions with effect from November 4, 2019 in addition to overnight variable rate reverse repo auctions. So far, four longer term reverse repo auctions have been conducted \u2013 two auctions of 21 days tenor and one each of 35 days and 42 days tenor \u2013 absorbing \u20b978,934 crore. Reflecting easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate (on an average) by 8 basis points (bps) in October and by 10 bps in November. 21. Monetary transmission has been full and reasonably swift across various money market segments and the private corporate bond market. As against the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 135 bps during February-October 2019, transmission to various money and corporate debt market segments ranged from 137 bps (overnight call money market) to 218 bps (3-month CPs of non-banking finance companies). Transmission to the government securities market, however, has been partial at 113 bps (5-year government securities) and 89 bps (10-year government securities). Credit market transmission remains delayed but is picking up. The 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) has declined by 49 basis points. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 44 basis points, while the WALR on outstanding rupee loans increased by 2 basis points during this period. However, transmission is expected to improve going forward as (i) the share of base rate loans, interest rates on which have remained sticky, declines; and (ii) MCLR-based floating rate loans, which typically have annual resets, become due for renewal. 22. After the introduction of the external benchmark system, most banks have linked their lending rates to the policy repo rate of the Reserve Bank. The median term deposit rate has declined by 47 bps during February-November 2019. The weighted average term deposit rate declined by 9 bps in October as against a decline of just 7 bps in eight months during February-September. This augurs well for transmission to lending rates, going forward. 23. Exports contracted in September-October 2019, reflecting the persisting weakness in global trade. Excluding petroleum products, however, the decline in exports was less pronounced and, in fact, non-oil export growth returned to positive territory in October after a hiatus of two months. Imports contracted faster than exports, with lower international crude oil prices resulting in a decline in the oil import bill. A sharp contraction in the volume of gold imports kept outgoes on this account in check. Non-oil non-gold imports also contracted, pulled down by electronics, coal and pearls and precious stones. Reflecting these developments, the trade deficit narrowed in September-October. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment rose to US$ 20.9 billion in H1:2019-20 from US$ 17.0 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment was of the order of US$ 8.8 billion in April-November 2019 as against net outflows of US$ 14.9 billion in the same period of last year. In addition, net investment by FPIs under the voluntary retention route have amounted to US$ 6.3 billion since March 11, 2019. Net disbursals of external commercial borrowings rose to US$ 11.5 billion during April-October 2019 as against US$ 1.2 billion during the same period a year ago. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 451.7 billion on December 3, 2019 \u2013 an increase of US$ 38.8 billion over end-March 2019. Outlook 24. In the fourth bi-monthly resolution of October 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 3.4 per cent for Q2:2019-20, 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 3.6 per cent for Q1:2020-21 with risks evenly balanced. The actual inflation outcome for Q2 evolved broadly in line with projections \u2013 averaging 3.5 per cent. The inflation print for October, however, was much higher than expected. 25. Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors. First, the upsurge in prices of vegetables is likely to continue in immediate months; however, a pick-up in arrivals from the late kharif season along with measures taken by the Government to augment supply through imports should help soften vegetables prices by early February 2020. Second, incipient price pressures seen in other food items such as milk, pulses, and sugar are likely to be sustained, with implications for the trajectory of food inflation. Third, both the 3-month and 1-year ahead inflation expectations of households polled by the Reserve Bank have risen and these latent sentiment upsides are being reflected in other surveys as well. Fourth, domestic financial markets have exhibited volatility. Fifth, domestic demand has slowed down, which is being reflected in the softening of inflation excluding food and fuel. Sixth, crude oil prices are expected to remain range bound, barring any supply disruptions due to geo-political tensions. Taking into consideration these factors, the CPI inflation projection is revised upwards to 5.1-4.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 4.0-3.8 per cent for H1:2020-21, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). 26. Turning to the growth outlook, real GDP growth for 2019-20 in the October policy was projected at 6.1 per cent \u2013 5.3 per cent in Q2:2019-20 and in the range of 6.6-7.2 per cent for H2:2019-20 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced; and 7.2 per cent for Q1:2020-21. GDP growth for Q2:2019-20 turned out to be significantly lower than projected. Various high frequency indicators suggest that domestic and external demand conditions have remained weak. Based on the early results, the business expectations index of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey indicates a marginal pickup in business sentiments in Q4. On the positive side, however, monetary policy easing since February 2019 and the measures initiated by the Government over the last few months are expected to revive sentiment and spur domestic demand. Taking into consideration these factors, real GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 6.1 per cent in the October policy to 5.0 per cent \u2013 4.9-5.5 per cent in H2 and 5.9-6.3 per cent for H1:2020-21 (Chart 2). While improved monetary transmission and a quick resolution of global trade tensions are possible upsides to growth projections, a delay in revival of domestic demand, a further slowdown in global economic activity and geo-political tensions are downside risks. The MPC notes that economic activity has weakened further and the output gap 27. remains negative. However, several measures already initiated by the Government and the monetary easing undertaken by the Reserve Bank since February 2019 are gradually expected to further feed into the real economy. Data on corporate finance and on projects sanctioned by banks and financial institutions suggest some early signs of recovery in investment activity, though its sustainability needs to be watched closely. The need at this juncture is to address impediments, which are holding back investments. The introduction of external benchmarks is expected to strengthen monetary transmission. In this context, there is also a need for greater flexibility in the adjustment in interest rates on small saving schemes. In the judgement of the MPC, inflation is rising in the near-term, but it is likely to moderate below target by Q2:2020-21. It is, therefore, prudent to carefully monitor incoming data to gain clarity on the inflation outlook. Similarly, the forthcoming union budget will provide better insight into further measures to be undertaken by the Government and their impact on growth. 28. The MPC recognises that there is monetary policy space for future action. However, given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the MPC felt it appropriate to take a pause at this juncture. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. 29. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 voted in favour of the decision. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by December 19, 2019. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 4-6, 2020. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent 32. Inflationary expectations are important in driving actual inflation. Since the last review, there has been a sharp spike in both the 3-month ahead (by 120 bps) inflationary expectations from 8% to 9.2% and 1-year ahead (by 180 bps) inflationary expectations from 8.1% to 9.9%. Such a sharp increase has not been seen in the past three years. Even the 3- month 33. ahead trimmed mean (from 8.7% to 9.7%) and one year ahead trimmed mean (8.6% to 9.9%) have increased. While these trends may be adaptively reflecting the rise in food inflation, they also may possibly reflect the rise in economic policy uncertainty in the current growth climate. 34. October food inflation printed at 6.9% which is a 39-month high. The cumulative momentum in food between April-October FY:19-20 is higher than that in the previous three financial years. Unseasonal rainfall has led to both a damage to Kharif output and to a delay in the sowing of the Rabi crop. This is building into price pressures. While some of the impulses could be idiosyncratic, it may also be that food surprises sustain going forward. For instance, the cumulative momentum of food excluding vegetables by October was higher this financial year. I have been concerned about the trajectory of food inflation in the last several reviews. 35. Headline inflation at 4.6% printed at a 16-month high. In contrast, inflation excluding food and fuel, moderated by 80 bps from 4.2% in September to 3.4% in October. Inflation excluding food and fuel still indicates relatively soft cumulative momentum so far in FY:2019-20, reflecting lacklustre demand in the economy. The price build up in services has also remained soft in groups such as housing, health, and education, which has helped contribute to low momentum in inflation excluding food and fuel. Low service sector inflation however is unlikely to sustain. This is because the service sector in India tends to be heavily supply constrained. 36. Economic growth continues to be lacklustre. Growth in Q2: FY19-20 fell further to 4.5%, the lowest in 26 quarters with investment growing at 1%. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) continued to be in contraction in September (-4.3%) compared to -1.4% in August. The weakness in the IIP was manifest across all segments. The truncated IIP also contracted by -5.5% in September. Based on RBI\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS), demand conditions remained pessimistic in Q3: FY 19-20. Despite lacklustre growth, and rising inflation, I think monetary policy is in a good 37. place right now. 38. on the evolving growth-inflation risk picture. There are mitigating factors that would suggest that it is best to obtain greater clarity 39. First, counter-cyclical monetary policy has not been as effective as expected due to inadequate monetary policy transmission. Weak monetary transmission is one of the factors that has resulted in the poor macroeconomic equilibrium the economy is currently in and it could lead to excesses in the financial sector. Transmission will no doubt improve with external benchmarking as the proportion of 40. loans linked to the MCLR falls and more loans become linked to the external benchmark. Further, reducing risk aversion in the NBFC sector, problems in which have led to elevated term premia, is more in the domain of \u201cmacro-prudential policy\u201d, rather than monetary policy. 41. wait and watch approach is appropriate. Second, a few positive factors have emerged since the last review. This suggests that a 42. First, the WALR on fresh rupee loans has fallen by 44 bps (from 29 bps in the last review). A large quantum of rate cuts has still not been transmitted, and the MPC loses nothing by waiting for a couple of months. Second, net FDI into India, at 20.9 Billion USD between April-September 2019 continues to be strong. Third, within exports, the share of sectors recording negative growth has reduced to 38.2% in October 2019. Fourth, in October, some high frequency indicators have begun to contribute to a positive momentum in growth, suggesting that it is best to wait for a few months to see whether the slowdown has bottomed out or not. Fifth, it is best to wait to see how the corporate tax cuts have impacted the economy. Since the tax cut was announced on September 20, and RBI\u2019s analysis of corporate performance corresponded to the end of September, this data did not pick up the effects of the tax cut. Further, the corporate tax cut for new companies will only apply after October 1. Sixth, the large decline in capacity utilization (CU) to 68.9% in Q2: FY 19-20 based on early results of Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilisation Survey, needs further clarification. Importantly, using sentiments on CU in the IOS, Q3: FY 19-20 is forecasted to improve somewhat. Seventh, consumption expenditure (PFCE) growth has strengthened to a little over 5% in Q2: FY 19-20 from 3.1% in Q1: FY19-20 which is noteworthy notwithstanding the deflator effect. Eighth, the PMI in both manufacturing and services has strengthened in their most recent readings. Ninth, the risk environment in the global economy appears to have abated a bit suggesting that global recession risks seem to have waned. 43. I worry however that real wage growth in the organized sector has further weakened since the last review. In the rural sector, weak demand conditions add to the prospect of a \u201cone-legged\u201d recovery driven by the urban sector. 44. I vote to pause. I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative. I will remain data dependant, going forward; further monetary policy action will depend on the evolving growth-inflation dynamics. Headline inflation, measured by CPI inflation, increased from 3.3% in August and 4% 45. in September 2019 to 4.6% in October. Food inflation increased from 4.7% in September to 6.9% in October, mainly due to an increase in inflation in vegetables, fruits, pulses, milk and cereals. Inflation excluding food and fuel moderated to 3.4% in October from 4.2% in September, reflecting favourable base effects, as well as softening domestic demand. 46. Looking forward, inflation expectations of households, as captured through RBI\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of Households, increased in the November 2019 round, compared to the September round, by 120 basis points for the three-month-ahead horizon and by 180 basis points for the one-year-ahead horizon, possibly due to the sharp increase in food prices. At the same time, the Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) shows an expectation of subdued selling prices of manufacturing in Q4:2019-20, as well as reduced input cost pressures. 47. The increase in prices of vegetables is expected to continue in the near future, but moderate by February 2020 due to higher arrivals in the late kharif and subsequently from the rabi season, as well as measures taken by the government to augment the supply through imports. On the output side, GDP growth fell for the sixth consecutive quarter to 4.5% (y-o-y) 48. in Q2:2019-20 from 5% in the previous quarter. Growth in private final consumption expenditures was 5.1%, up from 3.1% in the previous quarter, and growth in government final consumption expenditure increased to 15.6%, while growth in gross capital formation slowed sharply. Excluding government final consumption expenditure, GDP growth is 3.1%, underlining the weakness in private domestic demand. Growth in GVA also fell to 4.3% in Q2:2019-20, pulled down by manufacturing sliding into contractionary territory, as well as moderation in services. 49. Turning to survey data, early results of RBI\u2019s Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) suggest a drop in capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector. The Business Assessment Index (a composite of demand indicators), based on the early results of the RBI\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey for the manufacturing sector, remained in the contractionary zone for Q3:2019-20. According to RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey, the Current Situation Index and the Future Expectations Index both dropped in the November 2019 round, implying lower current activity and a less optimistic outlook. Meanwhile, the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index increased from 50.6 in October to 51.2 in November, reflecting an increase in new orders and output. Thus, overall, private consumption and investment activity are weak, and business and 50. consumer sentiment are somewhat downbeat. Further, exports growth has contracted by less than imports growth, indicating that the slowdown in domestic demand may be somewhat more acute than the weakness in global growth. On the international front, some signs of a cyclical upturn in global industrial growth 51. are now in sight. Industrial growth prospects have improved for both France and Germany, although the US industrial outlook remains subdued. The outlook for the Chinese economy remains constrained, while Japan is flirting with recessionary conditions. Overall, the global economy is expected to experience uneven improvement in economic growth in the next few months, according to Economic Cycle Research Institute\u2019s (ECRI\u2019s) international leading indexes. However, the world\u2019s largest economies are in no position to act as locomotives to pull global growth out of the doldrums, and will therefore not be able to provide much impetus to the Indian economy. Thus, the drivers of growth for the Indian economy would have to be from within the economy. Meanwhile, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Coincident Index looks to have bottomed, having improved modestly of late. 52. On the domestic front, from the monetary policy perspective, monetary transmission of the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 135 basis points from February to October 2019 to the various money and corporate debt markets has been in the range of 137 basis points in the overnight call money market to 218 basis points in 3-month CPs of non- banking finance companies. Transmission to the government securities market has been partial at 113 basis points for 5-year government securities and 89 basis points for 10-year government securities. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks fell by 44 basis points during this period. Going forward, the recent linking of the lending rate to external benchmarking is expected to expedite the pending transmission, with most banks having linked their lending rates to the policy repo rate. Further, to reiterate what I said in the last policy, the policy heavy-lifting to reverse the 53. growth slowdown has to be a multi-pronged approach. In this regard, a number of measures have already been undertaken by the government with a focus on reviving growth. These include steps to relax norms for FDI, focus on seamless tax administration, improve ease of doing business, consolidate public sector banks, and encourage the flow of credit from the banking sector to the financial and real economy sectors. The government has also undertaken fiscal stimulus in the form of a major overhaul in corporate income tax aimed at reducing the overall tax burden on corporates and, in turn, improving India's global competitiveness. Such measures should help to improve the investment climate and attract more capital flows into India. 54. At the same time, lacklustre revenue collections, alongside lower nominal GDP growth rate add to the risk of fiscal slippage. Thus, at this juncture, it would be prudent to take a cue from the upcoming Budget on the government\u2019s initiatives to revive growth. 55. Thus, with the pending monetary transmission expected to be realised in the near future, measures already undertaken by the government to address the growth slowdown expected to play out, and growth initiatives expected to be announced in the upcoming Budget, there is merit in a wait-and-watch approach to see how these measures pan out and impact real economic activity, including investment, going forward. 56. At the same time, while growth is slowing, headline inflation is projected to rise in the near-term, but moderate to below target by Q2:2020-21. At this juncture, it is, therefore, best to monitor incoming data on both inflation and growth. I, therefore, vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and continue with the 57. accommodative stance. After the October 2019 meeting of MPC, the inflation readings of September and 58. October 2019 turned out to be substantially higher, resulting in RBI\u2019s forecast to be higher by 160 bps for the Q3 of 2019-20 with significant upward revisions in the forecast over the next year. Similarly, the estimate of the GDP growth for Q2 of 2019-20 has not only turned out to be 80 bps below but was also contrary to RBI\u2019s assessment that the growth slowdown would bottom out in Q1 of 2019-20. As I had pointed out in my statement in October MPC minutes, the RBI\u2019s forecast of 6.1% growth during the current year was on an optimistic side and would not materialize. Now the RBI has revised its expectation substantially downward to 5%, which seems plausible. The sharp spike in food inflation may continue for the next two- three months driving the headline inflation above the mid-point target and closer to the upper bound of the flexible target range. The forecast of inflation by RBI for the 4 quarters up to Q2 of 2020-21 is based on certain assumptions where considerable uncertainties are involved. I, therefore, take the RBI forecast of the headline inflation of 3.8% for Q2 of 2020-21 with some reservation at this point. Inflationary expectations that were reasonably anchored till recently can shoot up during this period as evident from the RBI Survey of Households and IIMA Survey of Businesses although the situation may not go out of control. Moreover, there are some green shoots of growth recovery during the third and fourth quarters of the current year perhaps in response to the counter-cyclical measures on the fiscal and monetary policy fronts, but they need to be confirmed with more data. I had argued for a 40 bps rate cut in the last policy and I still maintain that there is space for further rate cuts even now. The question is of the timing and magnitude. In my view, it is prudent to wait and watch out for clarity on growth \u2013 inflation dynamics and gain some more confidence at this juncture before taking a decisive action on the policy rate front. In the meantime, there is enough slack for the markets to adjust to the rate cuts already made. I, therefore, vote to hold the policy repo rate at 5.15% for now and continue with the accommodative stance. More specific reasons for my vote are as follows \u2013 i) While the current spike in the headline inflation is arguably due to the temporary supply shocks on the food front, the impact is not confined only to a few items. It is important to understand how much would be the impact and for how long. The household inflationary expectations as per the latest RBI survey showed a sharp increase by 120 bps and 180 bps for three months and twelve months ahead horizon. Thus, the surveyed households believe that the increased inflation is not a temporary phenomenon but can go on increasing over the whole of the year to come. On the other hand, IIM Ahmedabad Survey of Businesses shows an increase of only 10 bps in their inflationary expectation 12 months ahead indicating that the current spike is temporary. RBI\u2019s own forecasts support the latter, but they are based on some crucial assumptions, which are surrounded by several uncertainties. Clarity on this with more data is important. ii) My own research with a co-author published in the Economic and Political Weekly on 3rd March 2018 shows that as per recent inflation dynamics the second round effects of an external shock (like food or fuel prices) on the core inflation are, if at all, quite weak. Unlike in the past, it is the headline inflation that now reverts to the core rather than the core reverting to the headline. RBI\u2019s recent survey on consumer confidence provides some support to this argument. It has shown that in response to the sharp rise in the food prices, the consumption of the non-essential items has declined implying very low substitutability between food and non-food consumption. It may, therefore, be argued that inflationary expectations based largely on food inflation may not result in a rise in the core inflation. We may, however, need some more observations to confirm or contradict this argument. iii) Although the capacity utilization as per the early results of RBI survey has fallen substantially to less than 70% in Q2 of 2019-20, there are several green shoots of growth recovery in the economy. PMI in manufacturing as well as services has shown substantial increase with the latter turning into an expansionary mode from the earlier contraction. RBI survey has shown that corporates have turned investors from savers earlier. After a long time, corporates are increasing their physical assets and not financial assets. Transmission of rate cuts in the credit markets is picking up and with the policy of external benchmark for lending rates, it is likely to further pick up. RBI\u2019s own forecast suggests that the growth slowdown has bottomed out in Q2 of 2019-20 and gradual recovery would take place in Q3 and Q4 and continue in the next year. High frequency data and advance estimates of GDP for the current year need to be watched carefully to examine the extent and speed of this recovery since it can have implications for the headline inflation. iv) Union Budget for 2020-21 and the Economic Survey for 2019-20 are due in the next couple of months. As I have argued earlier, the growth recovery has to be addressed fundamentally and durably by the fiscal policy with the monetary policy, if at all, playing only a facilitating role. The stance, content and commitment of the fiscal measures outlined in the Budget and the Economic Survey should, therefore, provide extremely useful guidance on the growth concerns. In my opinion, monetary policy should supplement those efforts provided inflation risks are contained within the given target range. In this context, I would like to repeat my earlier arguments on the concerns about fiscal slippage. When there is a cyclical downturn due to serious growth slowdown, it is logical to expect a fiscal slippage even without any change in the fiscal policy parameters. If the estimates of nominal income growth are seriously undershot, revenues are bound to fall short of the target. If under such circumstances, expenditures are cut to maintain the fiscal deficit target, it would amount to a contractionary fiscal policy during a downturn!! Generally, the stabilization policies like fiscal and monetary policies should be counter-cyclical and not pro-cyclical. The fiscal discipline target of 3% of GDP under such circumstances should not be overemphasized and can be temporarily ignored. Even though the N.K. Singh Committee has provided for a slippage by 50 bps under such exigencies, there is hardly any rationale for only 50 bps slippage. In my opinion, therefore, the slippage of more than 50 basis points may also be justified under the present circumstances. It is important in my opinion to wait for the clarity of the government\u2019s commitment and action to tackle the growth slowdown before further action on the monetary front at present. 59. Given all these arguments, it is pragmatic to wait for more clarity to emerge for a firm action on policy rate. In the meantime, the expected better transmission of the past rate cuts will serve the purpose in any case. The stance should continue to be accommodative but in this policy, we should hold the repo rate at 5.15%. 60. The configuration of macroeconomic and financial conditions facing the MPC in this meeting exerts conflicting pulls. Arguably, the slump in real GDP growth warrants accommodative monetary policy actions and stance whereas the upturn in headline inflation for the third month in succession after a quiescent phase of nine months calls for an opposite response or at least status quo until there is ground to infer that the food price spirals that are driving it are on the ebb. 61. In this context, two features of the recent upsurge in inflation weigh upon the monetary policy decision. First, it is prudent to expect higher than current readings over the next two or three months. This warrants a pause in the sequence of rate reductions that began in February 2019. Second, inflation pressures are rotating from vegetable prices to those of other elements of food and beverages. By current reckoning, vegetables prices can be expected to reverse by Q4:2019-20 as the supply situation improves. They can, therefore, be looked through while setting monetary policy. The key question is: will the upside in other food prices reverse or persist, especially those of pulses and milk? If it persists, will it spill over into non-food inflation? This too warrants close monitoring of incoming data over the next few months and, therefore, a pause. Turning to the real economy, the weakness in overall activity may likely prolong into 62. Q3, if not turn weaker. In particular, the sharp downturn in the growth of investment calls for urgent policy responses, reinforcing the actions already taken. The contribution of monetary policy in this endeavour can be to reduce the cost of capital. To bring about the turnaround, however, the net present value of future income streams from investment must exceed the cost of capital. This will hinge around a rekindling of animal spirits in a business-conducive environment, highlighting the importance of close and continuous policy coordination. Monetary policy has been pre-emptive in supporting growth and is committed to remaining in accommodative mode until growth revives. With 135 basis points of interest rate reductions and fiscal policy actions working their way into the economy, it is apposite in this meeting to allow this pass-through and be in readiness to back signs of traction with resolute and calibrated policy actions. 63. While voting for status quo in this meeting, it is important to note that headroom is available to act and arrest any further weakening of growth impulses. With this objective in the fore, I also vote for maintaining the accommodative monetary policy stance. 64. Since the October policy, growth and inflation outcomes have deviated significantly from their paths projected by the RBI in the October policy. Real GDP growth at 4.5 per cent (y-o-y) in Q2:2019-20 turned out to be much weaker than 5.3 per cent projected earlier, despite a robust growth of 15.6 per cent in Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE). While private consumption improved, fixed investment grew at a measly rate of 1 per cent. On the GVA side, industrial and services growth slowed down, while agriculture growth picked up slightly. 65. Beyond Q2, the index of eight core industries further contracted by 5.8 per cent during October 2019 to register the lowest growth in 2011-12 series after contracting by 5.1 per cent in September 2019. Among other high frequency indicators, cement production, international air cargo traffic and railway freight traffic contracted further in October. On the positive side, passenger vehicles sales and domestic air passenger traffic \u2013 indicators of urban demand - saw positive growth in October, while motor cycles sales \u2013 an indicator of rural demand \u2013 witnessed lower contraction vis-\u00e0-vis September. The PMI for manufacturing and services improved in November. Rabi sowing is catching up. Adequate reservoir levels augur well for the rabi prospects. Growth projection for 2019-20 has been revised downwards to 5 per cent from 6.1 per cent in the last policy. 66. On the inflation front, unseasonal rains in October and early November damaged certain crops and also disrupted the mandi arrival patterns. As a result, the temporary demand- supply imbalance led to price pressures in several vegetables, especially onion prices. During H1: 2020-21, food prices are projected to soften in response to rabi supplies. Inflation pressures in CPI excluding food and fuel have softened further on account of continuing moderation in demand conditions. Median inflation expectations of households, which are somewhat backward looking and also highly sensitive to food inflation, firmed up significantly from 8 per cent to 9.2 per cent for three months ahead horizon, and from 8.1 per cent to 9.9 per cent for one year ahead horizon. 67. The headline inflation path for H2: 2019-20 is projected to rise to 5.1 to 4.7 per cent now as against 3.5 to 3.7 per cent earlier. However, inflation will moderate gradually below the target in Q2:2020-21. 68. The cumulative repo rate reduction of 135 bps effected since February 2019 has resulted in 44 bps reduction in weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans till October, which is lower than expected. It is, however, encouraging that there has been some improvement in transmission following the introduction of external benchmarking of new floating rate loans to the retail (housing, vehicle, education loans, etc.) and micro and small enterprises (MSE) sectors. After the introduction of external benchmarking system in October 2019, most of the banks have linked their lending rates to the policy repo rate. The weighted average term deposit rate (WATDR) declined by 9 bps in October, which bodes well for monetary transmission, going forward. 69. The MPC has cumulatively reduced the repo rate by 135 basis points, the impact of which will gradually be felt on the real economy. The current uptick in inflation driven by a sharp increase in food prices is expected to reverse. However, there exists considerable uncertainty on the food price trajectory, and the quantum of impact of unseasonal rains on kharif output would be known only early next year. The incoming data may also provide greater clarity on the growth outlook. I vote for a pause in the policy rate at this juncture. It is better to wait and watch for the incoming data. Even as space exists for future monetary policy action, a pause at this juncture would help calibrate the appropriate policy response in future. I also vote for persevering with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 70. Economic activity has continued to weaken with GDP growth decelerating for the sixth consecutive quarter for Q2:2019-20. Of the two main components of GDP, while investment activity weakened further, private consumption showed signs of recovery. CPI inflation has surged in last three consecutive months reflecting a spike in vegetable prices and price pressures in some other food items. However, inflation excluding food and fuel glided below four per cent, suggesting subdued domestic demand conditions. Global economic activity has remained weak, weighed down by continuing uncertainty relating to trade conflicts. Major central banks have maintained accommodative monetary policy stances. 71. Headline inflation rose sharply in September and further in October, driven up by a sudden spike in prices of vegetables as kharif crop was damaged due to unseasonal rains in many parts of the country; increase in prices of onion was particularly sharp. Prices of certain non-vegetable foods items such as pulses, cereals, fruits and sugar increased at a faster pace than in previous two years. On the whole, food group inflation was at a 39-month high in October. Fuel group inflation remained in deflation for the fourth consecutive month in October mainly due to continuing deflation in LPG prices. Electricity prices, however, picked up in many states. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated to an all-time low of 3.4 per cent in 72. October. Apart from the strong favourable base effect, price increases also moderated in several services such as transport fares, telephone charges, tuition fees, recreation and amusement and house rentals. Inflation expectations of households polled in the last round of the survey conducted by the Reserve Bank, however, increased sharply for both the 3-month ahead and 12-month ahead horizons, possibly reflecting the sharp rise in food prices. CPI inflation is projected to rise to 5.1-4.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 before moderating to 4.0-3.8 per cent for H1:2020-21. 73. Turning to economic activity, GDP growth decelerated to 4.5 per cent for Q2:2019-20 from 5.0 per cent in Q1; the Reserve Bank had projected GDP growth for Q2 at 5.3 per cent in its October policy. Though growth in private consumption recovered to 5.1 per cent in Q2 from 3.1 per cent in Q1, it needs to be seen whether it will be sustained. Government final consumption expenditure surged to provide a strong support to economic activity, in the absence of which growth would have been still lower. On the supply side, manufacturing activity contracted. Early results of the order books, inventory and capacity utilisation (OBICUS) survey conducted by the Reserve Bank suggest that capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector declined to 68.9 per cent in Q2:2019-20 from 73.6 per cent in Q1. Services sector activity also moderated, despite a pick up in growth in public administration, defence and other services (PADO). 74. Beyond Q2, however, some positive signs have emerged. Rabi sowing has caught up considerably from the setback caused by delay in kharif harvesting and unseasonal rainfall in October and early November. Storage in major reservoirs at 86 per cent of the full reservoir level as on November 28 was much higher as compared with 61 per cent a year ago. This augurs well for the rabi season. While the output of eight core industries contracted in October, PMI manufacturing increased to 51.2 in November from 50.6 in October. Certain high frequency indicators of the services sector showed positive growth in October/November vis-\u00e0-vis September. Passenger vehicle sales, domestic and international air passenger traffic, foreign tourist arrivals, and finished steel consumption showed higher growth in October in comparison with the previous month. Though commercial vehicle and two-wheeler sales contracted in October, the pace of contraction slowed down. The PMI for services, which was in contraction in October (49.2), moved into expansion zone to 52.7 in November. Real GDP growth for 2019-20 has been revised downwards from 6.1 per cent in the October policy to 5.0 per cent \u2013 4.9-5.5 per cent in H2:2019-20; GDP growth has been projected at 5.9-6.3 per cent for H1:2020-21. While improved monetary transmission and a quick resolution of global trade tensions could push the growth above the projected trajectory, a delay in revival of domestic demand, a further slowdown in global economic activity and geo-political tensions could pull it down below the projected path. 75. Monetary transmission has been full and almost instantaneous across various money market segments and private corporate bond yields, while the transmission to the government securities market has been partial. Despite some improvement in the recent period, monetary transmission to lending rates of banks remains inadequate. The 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) declined by 49 basis points during February-November 2019. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 44 basis points during February-October 2019, while the WALR on outstanding rupee loans increased by 2 basis points during the same period. With the introduction of the external benchmark system, transmission is expected to improve going forward as the existing MCLR-based floating rate loans, which typically have annual resets, become due for renewal. Overall liquidity in the system remains in sizable surplus. The weighted average term deposit rate declined by 9 bps in October and 16 basis points during February-October 2019. This bodes well for transmission to lending rates. 76. Overall, several uncertainties cloud the growth-inflation outlook. First, the surge in food inflation in last three months, driven up by a spike in onion and other vegetable prices, could be transitory. It is likely to reverse gradually as late kharif output comes to the market. In view of this, even as current food price spike driven by vegetables can be looked through, there is a need for greater clarity as to how the overall food inflation path is going to evolve, as there is some uncertainty about the outlook of prices of certain non-vegetable food items such as cereals, pulses, milk and sugar. It is also not clear at this stage as to how the recent increase in telecom charges will play out even as CPI inflation excluding food and fuel has moderated. Second, though domestic demand conditions have weakened, certain high frequency 77. indicators have improved in the more recent period. There are also some indications that the capex cycle may be turning up as reflected in (i) an increase in the share of funds deployed in fixed assets to 45.6 per cent during H1:2019-20 from 18.9 per cent during H1:2018-19, based on the results of 1539 listed private manufacturing companies; and (ii) an increase in total cost of projects sanctioned in the private sector by banks/financial institutions to ` 79,525 crore in Q2:2019-20 from ` 45,781 crore in Q1. These are positive developments but need to be carefully assessed with incoming data for their sustainability. 78. policy rate reductions on monetary transmission, however, is still unfolding. Third, monetary transmission has improved in recent months. The impact of past Fourth, the impact of recent counter-cyclical measures taken by the Government is 79. playing out. The next budget is due for presentation in about two months and it will provide greater clarity about the further measures that the Government may initiate. It is imperative that monetary and fiscal policies work in close coordination. Fifth, global financial markets have remained volatile caused by trade related 80. uncertainties. Considering all these aspects in their totality, on balance, I vote for keeping the policy 81. repo rate on hold at the present level of 5.15 per cent in this meeting and for maintaining the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. There is policy space, the use of which, however, needs to be appropriately timed for ensuring its optimal impact. ", "Feb_2020": "The twenty first meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during February 4 to 6, 2020 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, former Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Janak Raj, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (February 6, 2020) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 5.15 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 4.90 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 5.40 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC met last in December 2019, global economic activity has remained slow-paced, but is getting differentiated across geographies. Among the key advanced economies (AEs), the US economy grew by 2.1 per cent in Q4:2019, the same pace as in Q3, with slack in consumer spending offset by government expenditure. In the euro area, economic activity slowed down in Q4 as France and Italy shrank unexpectedly amid waning consumer confidence. Growth momentum in the UK appears to have weakened in Q4 as reflected in a decline in industrial production and tepid retail sales. The Japanese economy was weighed down in Q4 by weak retail sales as reflected in subdued consumer spending in the wake of the sales tax hike in October. Industrial production in Japan was pulled down by muted global demand. 7. Among emerging market economies (EMEs), the Chinese economy slowed down to a 29-year low of 6.1 per cent in 2019, caused by sluggish domestic demand and prolonged trade tensions. In Russia, available indicators point to a loss of momentum in activity in Q4:2019 with industrial production easing, although private consumption may have provided some cushion. In Brazil, activity seems to have slowed down, as reflected in a contraction in industrial production and depressed retail sales. The South African economy recorded a growth of -0.6 per cent in Q3 and is likely to have also contracted in Q4 as industrial production slumped and household spending remained subdued amidst lingering consumer pessimism. 8. Crude oil and gold prices shot up in early January sparked by the US-Iran confrontation, but both softened from mid-January as geo-political tensions eased. By end-January, crude oil prices dipped sharply due to sell-offs triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus. Gold prices, on the other hand, inched up towards end-January because of safe haven demand. International food prices have been rising on higher demand and supply disruptions from major exporting countries. Reflecting these developments, inflation has edged up in some major AEs and EMEs. 9. Global financial markets remained resilient in December 2019 and for the most part of January 2020 as thawing US-China trade relations and improved prospects of an orderly Brexit buoyed investors\u2019 sentiment. Equity markets rallied across AEs and EMEs, turning bearish towards end-January with the outbreak of the coronavirus as markets braced up for the likely adverse impact on growth prospects, particularly in China. However, equity markets in most economies recovered some of the losses in early February. Bond yields, which had hardened in the US towards the end of 2019 as investors turned to riskier assets, softened in January 2020, especially after the US Fed left the policy rate unchanged and assured the extension of repo operations. In the euro area, bond yields sank further into negative territory in January. Yields also softened across several EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar strengthened in January against major advanced economies in sympathy with factors impacting US bond markets. EME currencies, which were generally trading with an appreciating bias, have depreciated since the last week of January. 10. Moving on to the domestic economy, the first advance estimates (FAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on January 7, 2020 placed India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2019-20 at 5.0 per cent. In its January 31 release, the NSO revised real GDP growth for 2018-19 to 6.1 per cent from 6.8 per cent given in the provisional estimates of May 2019. On the supply side, growth of real gross value added (GVA) is estimated at 4.9 per cent in 2019-20 as compared with 6.0 per cent in 2018-19. 11. Turning to more recent indicators, both production and imports of capital goods \u2013 two key pointers of investment activity \u2013 continued to contract in November/December, though at a moderate pace compared with the previous month. Revenue expenditure of the Centre (excluding interest payments and subsidies) remained robust in Q3, indicative of the counter-cyclical buffer to domestic demand being provided by government final consumption. As per revised estimates given in the Union Budget, growth in revenue expenditure of the Centre (excluding interest payments and subsidies) is estimated to be lower in Q4 compared with Q3. 12. On the supply side, rabi sowing has been higher by 9.5 per cent up to January 31, 2020 compared with a year ago. The north east monsoon rainfall was above normal. Storage in major reservoirs \u2013 the main source of irrigation during the rabi season \u2013 was 70 per cent of the full reservoir level (as on January 30, 2020) as compared with 45 per cent a year ago. Based on the first advance estimates, horticulture production is estimated to have risen 0.8 per cent to a record level in 2019-20. Production of vegetables is estimated to have increased by 2.6 per cent in 2019-20 due to higher production of onions, potatoes and tomatoes. 13. Industrial activity, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), improved in November after contracting in the previous three months. The output of core industries returned to positive territory in December after four months of contraction, buoyed by five out of eight of its constituents \u2013 coal; refinery products; fertilisers; steel; and cement. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), fell to 69.1 per cent in Q2 from 73.6 per cent in Q1; seasonally adjusted CU also eased to 70.3 per cent from 73.4 per cent. The Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey points to weak demand conditions facing the manufacturing sector in Q3:2019-20. The Reserve Bank\u2019s business expectations index suggests an improvement in Q4. This is corroborated by the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) for January 2020 which picked up sharply to 55.3 from 51.2 in November 2019 on the back of increased output and new orders. 14. Several high frequency indicators of services have turned upwards in the recent period, pointing to a modest revival in momentum, although the outlook is still muted. Amongst indicators of rural demand, while tractor sales grew by 2.4 per cent in December after ten months of a decline, motorcycle sales continued to contract. Domestic air passenger traffic \u2013 an indicator of urban demand \u2013 posted double digit growth in November, followed by a modest growth in December. Growth in three- wheeler sales and railway freight traffic has accelerated, while port traffic turned around in December. On the other hand, passenger vehicle sales continued to contract. The PMI services index improved to 55.5 in January 2020 from 52.7 in November 2019, boosted by a rise in new business and output. 15. Retail inflation, measured by year-on-year changes in the CPI, surged from 4.6 per cent in October to 5.5 per cent in November and further to 7.4 per cent in December 2019, the highest reading since July 2014. While food group inflation rose to double digits, the fuel group moved out of deflation. Inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel continued to edge up from its October trough. 16. CPI food inflation increased from 6.9 per cent in October to 12.2 per cent in December, primarily caused by a spike in onion prices due to unseasonal rains in October-November. Excluding onions, food inflation would have been lower by 4.7 percentage points and headline inflation by 2.1 percentage points in December. In addition, inflation in several other food sub-groups such as milk, pulses, cereals, edible oils, eggs, meat and fish also firmed up. 17. The CPI fuel group registered inflation of 0.7 per cent in December, reflecting an increase in prices of electricity and firewood and chips; and in administered prices of kerosene. Together they constitute 68 per cent of the CPI fuel basket. LPG inflation remained in negative territory despite a sharp recovery in prices in November-December. 18. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose from a low of 3.4 per cent in October to 3.8 per cent by December 2019, driven by an increase in inflation in mobile phone charges, petrol, diesel, transportation fares and clothing. Housing inflation moderated further in December reflecting subdued demand. 19. Households\u2019 inflation expectations eased in the January 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey \u2013 after a sharp pick-up in the previous round \u2013 with the 3- month ahead and 1-year ahead inflation expectations falling by 60 basis points (bps) and 70 bps, respectively. Based on the Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey, consumer spending on non-essential items of consumption contracted from a year ago; however, overall spending is expected to rise, going forward, reflecting an increase in prices. The December 2019 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey suggests that the input and output prices of manufacturing firms remained subdued in Q3:2019-20 and are likely to remain so in Q4. 20. Overall liquidity in the system remained in surplus in December 2019 and January 2020. Average daily net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) amounted to \u20b92.61 lakh crore in December 2019. In January 2020, the average daily net absorption of surplus liquidity soared to \u20b93.18 lakh crore. The Reserve Bank conducted four auctions involving the simultaneous purchase of long-term and sale of short-term government securities under open market operations (OMOs) for a notified amount of \u20b910,000 crore each during December and January (December 23 and 30, 2019 and January 6 and 23, 2020). Reflecting these operations, the 10-year G-sec yield softened cumulatively by 15 bps between December 19, 2019 and January 31, 2020. During the intervening period, however, the yields fell by as much as 25 bps. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate (on an average) by 10 bps in December and by 19 bps in January on easy liquidity conditions. 21. Monetary transmission across various money market segments and the private corporate bond market has been sizable. As against the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 135 bps since February 2019, transmission to various money and corporate debt market segments up to January 31, 2020 ranged from 146 bps (overnight call money market) to 190 bps (3-month CPs of non-banking finance companies). Transmission through the longer end of government securities market was at 73 bps (5-year government securities) and 76 bps (10-year government securities). Transmission to the credit market is gradually improving. The 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) declined by 55 bps during February 2019 and January 2020. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 69 bps and the WALR on outstanding rupee loans by 13 bps during February-December 2019. 22. After the introduction of the external benchmark system, most banks have linked their lending rates for housing, personal and micro and small enterprises (MSEs) to the policy repo rate of the Reserve Bank. During October-December 2019, the WALRs of domestic (public and private sector) banks on fresh rupee loans declined by 18 bps for housing loans, 87 bps for vehicle loans and 23 bps for loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). 23. Export growth continued to contract in November-December 2019, reflecting the slowdown in global trade. Import growth slumped in November-December 2019, with contraction in both oil and non-oil non-gold imports. While the latter reflected the underlying weakness in domestic demand and was spread across categories such as transport equipment, coal, iron and steel and chemicals, outgoes on account of oil imports were lower due to a cut back in oil import volume. Gold imports also declined in December 2019. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment rose to US$ 24.4 billion in April-November 2019 from US$ 21.2 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment was of the order of US$ 8.6 billion in 2019-20 (up to February 4) as against net outflows of US$ 14.2 billion in the same period last year. In addition, net investments by FPIs under the voluntary retention route have aggregated US$ 7.8 billion since March 11, 2019. External commercial borrowings were higher at US$ 13.4 billion during April-December 2019 as compared with US$ 2.5 billion during the same period a year ago. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 471.4 billion on February 4, 2020 \u2013 an increase of US$ 58.5 billion over end-March 2019. Outlook 24. In the fifth bi-monthly resolution of December 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 5.1-4.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 4.0-3.8 per cent for H1:2020-21, with risks broadly balanced. The actual inflation outcome for Q2 at 5.8 per cent overshot projections by 70 bps, primarily due to the intensification of the onion price shock in December 2019 on account of unseasonal rains in October-November. 25. Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors. First, food inflation is likely to soften from the high levels of December and the decline is expected to become more pronounced during Q4:2019-20 as onion prices fall rapidly in response to arrivals of late kharif and rabi harvests. Higher vegetables production, despite the early loss due to unseasonal rain, is also likely to have a salutary impact on food inflation. On the other hand, the recent pick-up in prices of non-vegetable food items, specifically in milk due to a rise in input costs, and in pulses due to a shortfall in kharif production, are all likely to sustain. These factors could impart some upward bias to overall food prices. Second, crude prices are likely to remain volatile due to unabating geo-political tensions in the Middle East on the one hand, and the uncertain global economic outlook on the other. Third, there has been an increase in input costs for services, in recent months. However, subdued demand conditions, muted pricing power of corporates and the correction in energy prices since the last week of January may limit the pass-through to selling prices. Fourth, domestic financial markets remain volatile reflecting both global and domestic factors, which may have an influence on the inflation outlook. Fifth, base effects would turn favourable during Q3:2020-21. Sixth, the increase in customs duties on items of retail consumption in the budget may result in only a marginal one-time uptick in inflation. Taking into consideration these factors, and under the assumption of a normal south west monsoon in 2020-21, the CPI inflation projection is revised upwards to 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20; 5.4-5.0 per cent for H1:2020-21; and 3.2 per cent for Q3:2020-21, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). 26. Turning to the growth outlook, real GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected in the December 2019 policy at 5.0 per cent \u2013 4.9-5.5 per cent in H2. GDP growth for H1:2020-21 was projected at 5.9-6.3 per cent. For 2020-21, the growth outlook will be influenced by several factors. First, private consumption, particularly in rural areas, is expected to recover on the back of improved rabi prospects. The recent rise in food prices has shifted the terms of trade in favour of agriculture, which will support rural incomes. Second, the easing of global trade uncertainties should encourage exports and spur investment activity. The breakout of the coronavirus may, however, impact tourist arrivals and global trade. Third, monetary transmission in terms of a reduction in lending rates and financial flows to the commercial sector has progressed vis-\u00e0-vis the last policy, and this could spur both consumption and investment demand. Fourth, the rationalisation of personal income tax rates in the Union Budget 2020-21 should support domestic demand along with measures to boost rural and infrastructure spending. Taking into consideration the above factors, GDP growth for 2020-21 is projected at 6.0 per cent \u2013 in the range of 5.5-6.0 per cent in H1 and 6.2 per cent in Q3 (Chart 2). 27. The MPC notes that inflation has surged above the upper tolerance band around the target in December 2019, primarily on the back of the unusual spike in onion prices. Over the coming weeks and months, onion prices are likely to ebb as supply conditions improve. The salutary effects on headline inflation are, however, likely to be tempered by hardening of prices of other food items, notably those of pulses and proteins. Meanwhile adjustments to telecom charges are imparting cost- push pressures to CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Going forward, the trajectory of inflation excluding food and fuel needs to be carefully monitored as the pass- through of remaining revisions in mobile phone charges, the increase in prices of drugs and pharmaceuticals and the impact of new emission norms play out and feed into inflation formation. The MPC anticipates that the combination of these factors may keep headline inflation elevated in the short-run, at least through H1:2020-21. Overall, the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. Accordingly, the MPC will remain vigilant about the potential generalisation of inflationary pressures as several of the underlying factors cited earlier appear to be operating in concert. 28. At the same time, the MPC observes that the economy continues to be weak and the output gap remains negative. While some high-frequency indicators have turned around and point to a lift in the momentum of economic activity, there is a need to await incoming data to gauge their sustainability. Financial flows to the commercial sector have improved in recent months. The Union Budget 2020-21 has introduced several measures to provide an impetus to growth. While the emphasis on boosting the rural economy and infrastructure should help the growth momentum in the near-term, the corporate tax rate cuts of September 2019 should help boost the growth potential over the medium-term. The fiscal deficit of the Central Government for 2019-20 is placed at 3.8 per cent of GDP in the revised estimates as against 3.3 per cent of GDP in the budget estimates. The higher fiscal deficit in 2019-20 has not resulted in an increase in market borrowings compared to the budget estimates. The fiscal deficit is budgeted to decline to 3.5 per cent of GDP for 2020-21. Fresh gross market borrowings are budgeted to increase by \u20b970,000 crore to \u20b97.8 lakh crore in 2020-21 from \u20b97.1 lakh crore in 2019-20. The MPC notes that while there is a need for adjustment in interest rates on small saving schemes, the external benchmark system introduced from October 1, 2019 has strengthened monetary transmission. These developments should amplify the effects of the cumulative policy rate reductions undertaken by the Reserve Bank since February 2019 and pull up domestic demand going forward. 29. The MPC recognises that there is policy space available for future action. The path of inflation is, however, elevated and on a rising trajectory through Q4:2019-20. The outlook for inflation is highly uncertain at this juncture. On the other hand, economic activity remains subdued and the few indicators that have moved up recently are yet to gain traction in a more broad-based manner. Given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the MPC felt it appropriate to maintain status quo. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and persevere with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Janak Raj, Dr. 30. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by February 20, 2020. 32. 2020. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during March 31, April 1 and 3, Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 5.15 per cent 33. As in the last several reviews, I continue to track household inflationary expectations carefully. Surprisingly, since the last review, median 3- month ahead inflationary expectations have moderated from 9.2% to 8.6% (60 bps). One year ahead inflationary expectations have also moderated from 9.9% to 9.2% (70 bps). 34. While these drops adaptively reflect the decline in specific perishable food commodities, overall, I am \u201ctentatively encouraged\u201d by the relative stability of both the 3 month and 1 year ahead inflationary expectation series over the longer run. Post implementation of flexible targeting (post 2015), there is suggestive evidence of better anchoring of household inflationary expectations. 35. Post inflation targeting, inflation ex food and fuel has also not converged upwards towards headline CPI inflation as it did in the period prior to that suggesting the lack of second round effects. These factors will improve the short run output- inflation trade-off facing the MPC. 36. Headline CPI inflation in December spiked to 7.35% from 5.5% in November, and 4.6% in October. The sharp uptick in headline inflation was driven by a sharp uptick in food inflation. Onion inflation increased to 328%, which alone accounted for a 210 bps increase in headline inflation despite its small weight (0.64%) in the overall index. This is consistent with the significantly lower mandi arrival of onions in October-November due to unseasonal rains. 37. While some of the increase in the October\u2013December 2019 food inflation (average 9.3%) relative to October\u2013December 2018 inflation (average -1.2%) was due to a strong base effect, the cumulative momentum in food inflation in 2019-2020 so far has tracked the average momentum between 2012-13 and 2016-2017 much more closer than the cumulative momentum in the \u201coutlier\u201d years of 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. While this may be because of the significantly higher build up in vegetable momentum (food inflation ex vegetables however was also elevated at 5% y-o-y in December), it would be prudent to remain watchful of the outsized shocks to food. 38. Inflation ex food and fuel crept up marginally to 3.8% in December from 3.6% in November and 3.4% in October reflecting higher increases in telecom tariffs (which has elevated the transportation and communication sub-group inflation to 4.8% in December). However, all exclusion based measures of inflation (ranging from 3% to 3.8%) lie significantly below headline inflation. 39. In a testament to the success of flexible inflation targeting in India - helped also by good food management by the government - using data for the period January 2015 \u2013 December 2019, CPI headline inflation has averaged 4.2% \u2013 inflation ex food and fuel has averaged 4.8%, and food inflation has averaged 3.6%. 40. Economic growth is estimated to slow down to 5.0 per cent for 2019-20 by the NSO. The first advance estimate (FAE) for 2019-2020 puts Private Consumption Expenditure growth at a low 5.8% (compared to a 7.55% average growth between 2015-2016 and 2018-2019). Rural demand and rural wage growth continues to be weak. 41. Real sales of 286 listed private manufacturing companies in the manufacturing sector in Q3: 2019-2020 continued to weaken. Capacity utilization was lower at 69.1% in Q2: FY 19-20, consistent with low fixed investment and a negative output gap. Non-food credit growth continued with its declining trend since Q3: 2018-2019. 42. On the prospects for investment, what is disconcerting is that despite the enactment of the September 2019 corporate tax cut, there is no discernible increase in net profits in Q3:2019-20 across several firm types in RBI\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS). Profit margin expectations for Q4 also continue to be pessimistic across firm types. While it may still be early, the \u201cimpact effect\u201d of the corporate tax cut appears to have been to accelerate the extent of corporate deleveraging rather than increase planned capex in an environment with weak demand. The impact of the corporate tax rate on investment, capital deepening, and wage growth will crucially depend on how the Jorgensonian cost of capital falls in response to the tax cut. 43. On the positive side, broader economic activity is beginning to show preliminary signs of a turn-around. This is encouraging. 44. Eight core industries grew in December (1.3 %) and the full IIP grew in November (+1.8%) after four and three consecutive months of contraction, respectively. Several high frequency indicators have turned and/or strengthened since the last review: PMI Services, PMI Manufacturing, the Manufacturing IIP, Consumer Non-Durables, High Rabi sowing, Vehicle registration, Rail freight, GST Tax collections, and Cement and Steel Production amongst others. Monetary transmission has also gathered pace. Since February 2019, the WALR on fresh rupee loans has fallen by 69 bps, and on outstanding loans by 13bps. 45. The government had an unenviable position of walking a fiscal tightrope in Budget 2020. I see the corporate tax cuts and the personal income tax rationalization in this budget as part of the same combined stimulus. Taking the budget estimates at face value, a rough calculation suggests that this amounts to a tax-stimulus of about 0.9% of GDP (26 USD Billion / 2.9 USD Trillion). The stimulus (in the form of reductions in various rates) from the GST since its implementation in July 2017 probably amounts to an additional 0.3 % of GDP. The combined tax stimulus therefore approximates 1.2 percentage of GDP given the initiatives in the 2020 budget. If growth hasn\u2019t revived with a 135 bps cut in the policy rate, and a tax stimulus 46. amounting to 1.2% of GDP, then the need of the hour is more structural reform. 47. Having said this, fiscal deficit uncertainty may require the MPC to accept tighter than desired monetary conditions to ensure our commitment to the medium- term inflation target. 48. Real GDP growth during March 2015 \u2013 September 2019, has averaged 7.2%. This would suggest that the Indian economy has performed like a \u201c7-4\u201d economy (averaging roughly 7% growth and roughly 4% inflation) over the period of flexible inflation targeting. I find the growing chorus challenging the efficacy of flexible inflation targeting in India worrying. For those who advocate targeting an inflation rate higher than 4 per cent, I am sorry: 4-6% inflation is not price stability! 49. In sum, monetary policy continues to be well positioned. While I don\u2019t see space for further cuts going forward, I remain data dependent. While the current spike in headline inflation is likely to lack persistence, the inflation numbers should be carefully watched. 50. Given the above reasons, I vote to pause. I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative. 51. Headline inflation, measured by CPI inflation, increased to 7.4% in December 2019 (highest since July 2014) from 5.5% in November and 4.6% in October, primarily due to a sharp rise in food inflation to 12.2% in December. This, in turn, was mainly due to an increase in onion prices, accompanied by a rise in inflation in milk, pulses, cereals, edible oils, eggs, meat and fish. At the same time, CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose to 3.8% in December from 3.4% in October, driven primarily by an increase in inflation in the transport and communications sub-group. 52. Going forward, both survey data and model-based forecasts indicate a moderation in inflation. According to RBI\u2019s Inflation Expectations Survey of Households, conducted in January 2020, inflation expectations eased by 60 and 70 basis points over three-month and one-year ahead horizons, respectively, possibly due to an expected moderation in food prices. As per the December 2019 round of RBI\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey, manufacturing firms expect subdued selling prices in Q4:2019-20 as input costs are also expected to remain muted. Further, projections made by RBI indicate that inflation is expected to moderate but remain at elevated levels (5% or above) through Q2:2020-21. 53. The future inflation trajectory is subject to various factors, including downside risks such as sharper than expected moderation in onion prices and larger correction in prices of other vegetables due to higher production. Upside risks include an increase in global food prices, rise in gold prices, fluctuations in oil prices due to geo- political tensions, and an increase in input costs for services. Disruptions in the supply of Chinese imports due to the spread of coronavirus may also exert pressure on prices of goods imported from China. 54. On the output front, industrial production grew by 1.8% y-o-y in November, a sharp turnaround from -4.0% in October. Growth in broad categories under the sectoral classification as well as the use-based classification either increased from the previous month or the extent of contraction eased (with the exception of intermediate goods that grew by double-digits though the pace moderated). Growth turned from negative to positive for the mining and manufacturing sectors, whereas the contraction in growth eased in electricity. The pace of contraction also eased for primary goods, capital goods, infrastructure and construction goods, and consumer durables, while it turned from negative to positive for consumer non- durables. 55. According to the first advance estimates released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), real GDP growth for 2019-20 is pegged at 5%, while GVA growth is estimated at 4.9%. The estimates indicate a deceleration in consumption and investment as well as a contraction in exports, with reduced demand for imports. Industrial growth is also expected to decline, while agricultural growth is expected to edge up \u2013 as rabi sowing has been higher than the previous year. 56. Turning to survey data, RBI\u2019s Order Books, Inventory and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) shows a drop in capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector in Q2:2019-20 compared to Q1. The Business Assessment Index (a composite of demand the manufacturing sector, remained in the contractionary zone for Q3:2019-20. At the same time, the Business Expectations Index shows prospects of improvement for Q4. According to RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey, the Current Situation Index fell to a new low in January 2020 due to weaker sentiment on general economic situation, price level and household income. On the other hand, the Future Expectations Index witnessed a marginal uptick due to improved outlook on employment and prices. Meanwhile, the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index increased from 51.2 in November to 55.3 in January 2020, reflecting an increase in new orders and output. The PMI Services Index also picked up during this period. A few high frequency indicators are also showing signs of revival, such as tractor sales, three-wheeler sales, railway freight traffic and domestic air passenger traffic. for indicator), based on 57. Thus, there are some signs of a modest revival, although overall economic activity continues to remain weak. While the focus of the Union Budget is on sustainable growth within a framework of fiscal consolidation, it may provide some impetus to growth through the incremental rationalisation in personal taxes, focus on infrastructure and in manufacturing and enhancing the overall ease of doing business. However, the full impact of these measures may percolate slowly to the economy with possibly only a small effect visible in the short-run. raising competitiveness 58. Flow of credit to the commercial sector, that remained tepid till the MPC met last in December, picked up in the last two months. This should nurture growth impulses. The increase in the monetary transmission of the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 135 basis points from February to October 2019 should also help in reviving economic activity. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks fell by 69 basis points from February to December 2019 (implying an additional 25 basis points in November and December). Since the introduction of the external benchmarking system, many banks have linked their lending rates for housing, personal and micro and small enterprises (MSEs) to the policy repo rate. From October to December 2019, the WALRs of public and private sector banks on fresh rupee loans fell by 18, 87 and 23 basis points for housing loans, vehicle loans, and loans to MSMEs, respectively. Thus, the external benchmarking system has improved the extent of transmission, although there is still scope for more. 59. Moving on to the international front, some signs of a cyclical upturn in global industrial growth are in sight. On the verge of the coronavirus outbreak, growth in the Economic Cycle Research Institute\u2019s (ECRI\u2019s) 21-Country Long Leading Index, a harbinger of global economic activity, entered a mild cyclical upturn consistent with global growth prospects posting patchy progress. Meanwhile, a nascent upswing in global industrial growth had already begun, following a modest upturn in the growth rate of ECRI\u2019s Global Leading Manufacturing Index. In that context, it is notable that the coronavirus epidemic is not yet tipping global industrial growth into a fresh cyclical downturn. However, this has to be monitored closely to gauge the possible impact of the epidemic on global growth. 60. Aligned with the improvement in global growth prospects, growth in ECRI\u2019s Indian Leading Exports Index, a predictor of Indian exports growth, has increased recently, anticipating a revival in Indian exports growth, which has dropped to a multi- year low. This bodes well for India\u2019s exports, but has to be tracked closely in light of the recent epidemic. Therefore, as of now, it is not clear if economic growth in India can get a boost from global growth. 61. Thus, to address growth in the economy, there is merit in adopting a wait-and- watch approach. This will allow for the pending monetary transmission to be realised in the near future. Further, measures already undertaken by the government to address the growth slowdown are expected to play out, including the fiscal stimulus in the form of a major overhaul in corporate income tax aimed at reducing the overall tax burden on corporates and, in turn, improving India's global competitiveness. Moreover, growth initiatives announced in the Union Budget are also expected to pan out slowly. Additionally, the impact of global growth on the domestic economy would have to be examined in light of the recent epidemic. 62. At the same time, while growth is slowing, headline inflation has increased beyond the upper tolerance band and is expected to remain at elevated levels (5% or above) through Q2:2020-21. At this juncture, it is, therefore, best to monitor incoming data on both inflation and growth, given the evolving inflation-growth dynamics. I, therefore, vote the accommodative stance. to keep 63. Since the last meeting of MPC in December 2019, several major events have occurred and new data is available. Greater clarity has emerged on several uncertainties perceived at that time, though some new uncertainties have arisen and assumed more importance. The latest two readings of monthly headline inflation for November and December 2019 have been significantly above the RBI forecast largely on account of the spikes in onion prices. While this is transitory and in all likelihood would reverse soon, it is most likely to lead to a breach of upper tolerance limit for the headline inflation for a quarter for the first time since the MPC is functioning. Given the high Rabi sowing, record level of water storage in reservoirs, prolonged growth slowdown leading to expanding negative output gap, favourable base effects and some international developments, the headline CPI inflation going forward is expected to show a declining trend for at least a year to come. Some new uncertainties have, however, emerged that could need some policy space for future. Moreover, the Union Budget for 2020-21, in my opinion, has presented a fiscal policy of the Centre that borders on being contractionary rather than expansionary on misplaced concerns about fiscal slippage in the face of a serious growth slow-down. Under such circumstances, in my view, the monetary policy should preserve policy space for any rate action at an appropriate time. I, therefore, vote to maintain status quo on both the policy repo-rate and the accommodative stance in this meeting. More specific reasons for my vote are as follows \u2013 i) Uncertainty regarding food and vegetable prices during the last meeting of the MPC has reduced and it is getting clear that these prices would gradually come down to their original level over the next two \u2013 three quarters. Fuel prices rising substantially in the short term is hardly a risk given the international developments. Union Budget for 2020-21 has been presented with no major impact on both growth and inflation in my opinion. As a result, there is no risk of output gap closing rapidly in the short to medium term. Global growth slow- down is confirmed by now. ii) New uncertainties have emerged from the likely spread of Coronavirus and its impact through trade and fuel prices. It can lead to sharp swings in fuel prices in both the directions over time. Run up to the US Presidential elections and its possible impact on the geopolitics can have substantial impact on the global economic environment. The response of various State Governments to the Union Budget 2020-21 in terms of their own budgets is a major uncertainty deciding almost the other half of the fiscal policy for the country. Inflationary expectations of the households for 12 months ahead as revealed in the most recent RBI survey have declined by 70 bps compared to the previous round. This is, however, contradicted by an increase of 40 bps in the headline CPI inflation expectation by the businesses as revealed by the IIMA surveys. Thus, the picture is ambiguous on recent trends in inflationary expectations in the economy. RBI\u2019s own assessment about the inflation forecast four quarters down is 3.2%. Thus, although there is uncertainty, some policy space for the rate action does exist. The numbers presented in the Union Budget 2020-21 show that the fiscal slippage of 41 bps in the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio from the budgeted 3.34% in 2019-20 is accounted for by 36 bps due to cyclical factors and by only 5 bps of the genuine fiscal slippage. In a year of a serious growth slow-down, such an adherence to \u201cfiscal discipline\u201d not only shows misplaced emphasis and unjustified concerns but also a contractionary fiscal policy. The budgeted numbers for 2020-21 also continue along the same line and depict a contractionary fiscal policy. It is pro-cyclical rather than counter-cyclical. Moreover, the proportion of revenue deficit in the fiscal deficit in the budget for 2020-21 shows a substantial increase over 2019-20 (RE) that may not help crowding-in of the private investment. Immediate growth recovery may not be aided by the Union budget 2020-21. v) The growth slowdown may, therefore, be prolonged and the real growth may remain below 7.5% of the long-term trend for the next couple of years leading the negative output gap to expand. This is consistent with the capacity utilization rate of less than 70% presently observed in the RBI surveys. Thus, there would be downward pressure on the core inflation in the next few quarters. vi) Real rates of interest and policy rates globally are very low and negative in several comparator counties. Our real rates are high. Transmission of the past rate cuts is improving of late, which would continue to provide corrections to the real rates. 64. There is a definite space for policy rate action in the light of the above arguments. The question is \u2013 is this the right time? We need to wait for the other half of the fiscal policy given by the budgets of the States. While monetary policy is important for short run revival of aggregate demand, the long-term growth revival depends critically on the fiscal policy and structural reforms. When the long run revival is not seriously attempted, any substantial recovery in the short run is also likely to be elusive and the monetary policy stimulus that works only indirectly and with lags is also likely to be less effective. Under such circumstances, I would like to continue with status quo on both the policy repo-rate and the accommodative stance. 65. Headline inflation surged during last three months, driven mainly by an unprecedented spike in onion prices. Non-vegetable food prices such as pulses, milk, eggs, fish and meat also rose significantly, driven mainly by a shortfall in production due to unseasonal rains and a rise in input costs. While onion prices have already started reversing due to late kharif arrivals, the reversal is likely to be more pronounced once the rabi season harvest hits mandis in early March. However, the increase in inflation in non-vegetable food items is more likely to be sustained. Given this broad-based increase in food prices, there is a lot of uncertainty as to the level at which food inflation will stabilise even as onion prices normalise completely. Food inflation, therefore, needs a careful monitoring. 66. Inflation excluding food and fuel accelerated in recent months, driven mainly by cost push shocks such as increase in mobile phone charges. Rising input costs have transmitted to output prices, though weak pricing power of corporates due to deficient demand has limited its pass-through. Global commodity prices, especially of crude oil and metals, also declined sharply towards end-January in anticipation of slowdown in global demand due to the outbreak of coronavirus. This may help mitigate some of the input price pressures witnessed in the recent period. Though inflation expectations of households have moderated in the January 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, they are still elevated. Headline inflation is projected to remain at or above 5 per cent up to Q2: 2020-21, before moderating to 3.2 per cent in Q3. 67. Domestic economic activity has remained weak with GDP growth estimated at 5.0 per cent for 2019-20 being the lowest in last 11 years. Some of the major factors that have contributed to the growth slowdown are (i) ongoing deleveraging by the private corporate sector; (ii) continuing large inventory overhang in the residential real estate market; (iii) issues facing the auto sector; (iv) decline in income levels in rural areas due to low food prices in previous two years and deceleration in the growth of wages of agriculture and non-agricultural labourers; and (v) global uncertainties, especially trade tensions. All these factors have reduced aggregate demand by impacting investment and private consumption. 68. Some high frequency indicators such as consumer non-durables, tractor sales, port freight traffic, cement production and steel consumption have turned around in recent months. The index of industrial production (IIP) expanded in November 2019 despite contraction in the auto sector as well as eight core industries. Eight core industries, with a weight of 40 per cent in the IIP, also expanded in December. These are positive signs, though more data are needed to assess whether they are sustained. Several other indicators such as sales in commercial vehicles, passenger cars and motor cycles, and international air freight traffic have continued to contract. Credit flows continue to be tepid, though they are improving. 69. Overall, demand conditions remain weak. This is reflected in a variety of indicators such as non-oil non-gold imports, capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector much below the long-term average even when there is hardly any addition of new capacities, and weak pricing power of corporates. Consumer confidence is also low. 70. Going forward, the recent rise in food prices should boost rural incomes and help strengthen rural demand. The stress in the auto sector seems to be gradually receding. The inventory overhang in the real estate sector remains high and it will take time before it comes to normal levels. The real estate sector has huge forward and backward linkages and it is critical for reviving growth. Though global uncertainties relating to trade tensions and Brexit have abated, a new uncertainty from coronavirus has arisen. It is expected that epidemic of coronavirus will be overcome soon. However, should it prolong and spread, it will have ramifications for the global economy and its net impact on the Indian economy might be negative even if oil and other global commodity prices decline. 71. The impact of monetary easing undertaken since February 2019 continues to unfold. Monetary transmission has strengthened in recent months and it is expected to be reinforced further as existing loans are repriced at reduced interest rates. 72. While current low growth is the outcome of deficient demand, high inflation is an upshot of a supply shock. These conflicting dynamics pose a challenge for monetary policy. Weak demand conditions warrant further monetary policy easing, while elevated inflation and the highly uncertain inflation outlook call for a cautious approach. More data are needed for greater clarity. Hence, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate on hold at the current level and for persevering with the accommodative stance. There is policy space, which could be used once the inflation outlook becomes clear. In a scenario of slowdown in growth, monetary policy has a role to boost aggregate demand consistent with the inflation objective. However, for strengthening the medium-term growth potential of the economy, the need is to step up investment and improve productivity through further structural reforms. In this context, corporate tax cuts announced in September 2019 and higher budgeted capital outlay for 2020-21 compared with the previous year bode well for strengthening India\u2019s medium-term growth potential. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 73. As foretold in December 2019, the MPC has entered what I call the tunnel of testing trade-offs (TTT) and it may be a while before the light at the end of the tunnel is sighted. 74. Economic activity remains weak: there are indications of the momentum of growth stabilising, with sector-specific upticks underlying this guarded optimism, but they are far from gaining economy-wide traction. In some sectors, the slowdown is deep, and activity is stalled by sizable slack in demand. High frequency indicators are not offering definitive evidence yet that the downturn is bottoming out. 75. Global growth remains subdued. What seemed to be a synchronised downturn only a few months ago, is getting decoupled across jurisdictions. Until recently, emerging economies were cushioning the loss of pace in global growth. Now these economies are confronted with a downward slant in the balance of risks either from self-inflicted wounds or global spillovers. This is currently the big cloud on the outlook for the global economy. Overall, headwinds from the global economy continue to blow strongly, darkening the prospects for all economies, including India. The coronavirus outbreak has imparted new and uncertain risks in response to which the world is grappling to fashion a credible response. The implications for India are yet to unravel. 76. As in December, a monetary policy response to the state of the economy is stifled by higher than expected elevation in inflation. The breach in the upper tolerance band of the MPC\u2019s inflation target band in the December print may well recur in the months ahead. 77. The pre-emptive easing of monetary policy since February 2019 is now turning out to be fortuitous. Over the 12 months ahead horizon, the forecasts are indicating some let-up in inflationary pressures, but it is not yet clear as to when and how the current inflation surge will bottom. Monetary policy has headroom to respond to the evolving macroeconomic configuration, but a good fix is needed on the shape of the inflation hump it has chosen to look through. Hardening prices of proteins and pulses and a range of cost pushes to core inflation are new and ominous risks to the inflation outlook if they persist. 78. Incoming data will have to be carefully parsed for this purpose. The endeavour now should be to improve transmission of the cumulative 135 bps rate reduction effected since February 2019 and seize the opportunity when it opens up to act judiciously and effectively to support the economy. 79. It is in this context that I vote for maintaining status quo on the policy rate and to persevere with the accommodative stance of monetary policy until growth revives on a durable basis. 80. The Union Budget has proposed several initiatives to revitalize the economy within the envelope of pragmatic fiscal prudence. These are significant positives for the medium-term growth and stability outlook. Monetary policy will complement the fiscal impulse and boost it going forward. 81. Since the last policy in December 2019, economic activity has slowed down further with the GDP growth estimated to moderate to 5 per cent for 2019-20. CPI inflation surged in December to its highest reading since July 2014, driven by a spike in food inflation, an uptick in fuel inflation and firming up of inflation excluding food and fuel from its October trough. Global economic activity has also slowed down and the prospects have weakened even further with the outbreak of coronavirus as China is the second largest economy and it is a key player in global supply chain. Central banks in several advanced and emerging market economies have held their policy rates. 82. Headline CPI inflation increased for the fifth consecutive month to 7.4 per cent in December 2019 as food prices, particularly those of vegetables, surged. Inflation in vegetables shot up to 60.5 per cent in December from 36.1 per cent in November largely due to a spike in onion prices, caused by damage to kharif crop from unseasonal rains. Inflation in onion swelled to 328 per cent in December. Excluding onions, CPI inflation was at 5.2 per cent in December and excluding vegetables, inflation was at 4.1 per cent. Inflation in several other items of food such as milk, pulses, cereals, edible oils, egg, meat and fish also edged up. 83. The fuel group moved out of deflation in December with a sharp increase in LPG prices in previous two months and a pick-up in inflation in electricity and firewood and chips. 84. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel edged up to 3.8 per cent in December from 3.6 per cent in the previous month, driven by a rise in inflation in mobile charges, petroleum product prices, transportation fares and clothing. Inflation expectation of households, as polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s January 2020 round of survey, moderated by 60 bps and 70 bps for 3-month and 1-year ahead horizons, respectively. CPI inflation is projected at 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20; 5.4-5.0 per cent for H1:2020-21; and 3.2 per cent for Q3:2020-21. 85. On the growth front, the first advance estimates released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) placed India\u2019s real GDP growth for 2019-20 at 5.0 per cent due to slowdown in private final consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation. GDP estimates by the NSO for 2019-20 were in line with the projection set out in the 5th bi-monthly monetary policy. 86. Some green shoots are, however, visible. First, rabi sowing has been higher by 9.5 per cent. Horticulture production has also risen to a record level in 2019-20. This bodes well for farm incomes and boosting rural demand. Second, the index of industrial production (IIP) improved in November after contracting in the previous three months and growth of eight core industries also turned positive in December after four months of contraction. PMI manufacturing increased for January 2020. Business sentiment of manufacturing firms in Q4:2019-20, measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s business expectations index, also improved. However, capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey, deteriorated to 69.1 per cent in Q2:2019-20 from 73.6 per cent in Q1. Third, in the services sector, some high frequency indicators have turned up. Amongst indicators of rural demand, tractor sales emerged out of ten months of contraction in December. Of indicators of urban demand, domestic air passenger traffic posted double digit growth in November. PMI services also rose sharply in January 2020, underpinned by the rise in new business and output. However, durability of such green shoots will be clearer in the coming months. At the same time, some other indicators such as commercial and passenger vehicle sales, and domestic and international air cargo traffic continued to contract. Going forward, real GDP growth is projected at 6.0 per cent for 2020-21 \u2013 in the range of 5.5-6.0 per cent for H1 and 6.2 per cent for Q3. 87. As regards credit flows, non-food credit growth of scheduled commercial banks moderated to 7.1 per cent in 2019-20 (up to January 17, 2020) from 14.6 per cent last year. However, it is noteworthy that non-food credit has increased by Rs. 2.77 lakh crore since mid-September 2019 in contrast to a contraction of Rs.0.83 lakh crore between end-March and mid-September. The total flow of credit from both banks and non-banks (domestic and foreign) to the commercial sector increased from Rs. 3.11 lakh crore during the period from end-March to mid-September 2019 to Rs. 8.43 lakh crore in 2019-20 so far (up to January 17, 2020), though they have been lower as compared with the increase of Rs.15.79 lakh crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. 88. The transmission of policy rate reductions has been full across various money and bond market segments; transmission to the longer end of the government securities market, however, has been partial. Transmission to the credit market has improved in the recent period. As against the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 135 bps since February 2019, the 1-year median marginal cost-based lending rate (MCLR) has declined by 55 bps; the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans by 69 bps and the WALR on outstanding rupee loans by 13 bps. The external benchmark system has strengthened monetary transmission further. During October-December 2019, the WALR of domestic banks on fresh rupee loans declined by 18 bps for housing loans, 87 bps for vehicle loans and 23 bps for loans to MSMEs. These developments should amplify the effects of policy rate reductions since February 2019. 89. The Union Budget has sought to provide counter-cyclical support to the economy while broadly adhering to fiscal prudence. Monetary transmission and bank credit flows have improved, but they need to become stronger. While the macroeconomy needs further monetary stimulus, the inflation outlook continues to be uncertain. The seasonal winter softening of vegetable prices has been delayed, even as onion prices have begun to soften. Also, the prices of several other food items such as pulses, milk and edible oils have continued to rise. While demand conditions remain weak, there is uncertainty about the likely behaviour of inflation excluding food and fuel, given the recent cost push shocks, especially of mobile charges, prices of automobiles and essential medicines. Overall, the path of headline inflation is expected to moderate, but given the prevailing uncertainty, it is prudent to await more clarity based on incoming data. 90. Considering the overall evolving growth-inflation situation, it would be prudent to continue the focus on growth in the context of the expected moderation in inflation. This would indeed be in sync with the concept of flexible inflation targeting. Financial stability also requires revival of the growth trajectory. Considering all these aspects, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate on hold and for maintaining the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Barring the intensification of global risks, there is policy space that needs to be timed optimally and opportunistically to maximise its impact on growth. ", "Mar_2020": "The twenty second meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held during March 24, 26 and 27, 2020 at the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai; the meeting was originally scheduled for March 31, April 1 and 3, 2020, but was advanced in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, 2. Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, former Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Janak Raj, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua and Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia joined the meeting through video conference. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (March 27, 2020) decided to:  reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 75 basis points to 4.40 per cent from 5.15 per cent with immediate effect; accordingly, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate stand  reduced to 4.65 per cent from 5.40 per cent; further, consequent upon the widening of the LAF corridor as detailed in the accompanying Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Polices, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced by 90 basis points to 4.0 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of coronavirus (COVID- 19) on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Global economic activity has come to a near standstill as COVID-19 related lockdowns and social distancing are imposed across a widening swathe of affected countries. Expectations of a shallow recovery in 2020 from 2019\u2019s decade low in global growth have been dashed. The outlook is now heavily contingent upon the intensity, spread and duration of the pandemic. There is a rising probability that large parts of the global economy will slip into recession. 7. Financial markets have become highly volatile from January onwards due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Panic sell-offs have resulted in wealth destruction in equity markets across advanced and emerging economies alike. In the former, flight to safety has pulled down government bond yields to record lows with some hardening in recent days. In the latter, the rush to exit has rendered fixed income markets illiquid and resulted in firming up of yields. Emerging and advanced economy currencies are experiencing severe depreciation pressure on a daily basis because of fire sales due to extreme risk aversion. At this point, only the US dollar remains safe haven in a highly uncertain outlook. Japanese yen and gold \u2013 the other two safe havens till the early part of March \u2013 have given way to a flight to cash. International crude prices initially traded with a softening bias from January in anticipation of demand weakening due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Production cut disagreements among key oil producers, however, set off retaliatory supply scale-ups and a price war that plunged international Brent crude prices 2 to a low of US$ 25 per barrel on March 18, 2020. These developments are likely to dampen inflation across advanced and emerging economies. Central banks and governments are in war mode, responding to the situation with several conventional and unconventional measures targeted at easing financial conditions to avoid a demand collapse and to prevent financial markets from freezing up due to illiquidity. 8. The second advance estimates of the National Statistics Office released in February 2020 implied real GDP growth of 4.7 per cent for Q4:2019-20 within the annual estimate of 5 per cent for the year as a whole. This is now at risk from the pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy. High frequency indicators suggest that private final consumption expenditure has been hit hardest, even as gross fixed capital formation has been in contraction since Q2:2019-20. On the supply side, the outlook for agriculture and allied activities appears to be the only silver lining, with foodgrains output at 292 million tonnes being 2.4 per cent higher than a year ago. A pick-up in manufacturing and electricity generation pulled industrial production into positive territory in January 2020 after intermittent contraction and/or lacklustre activity over the past five months; however, more data will need to be watched to assess whether the recent uptick will endure in the face of COVID-19. Meanwhile, most service sector indicators for January and February 2020 moderated or declined. Since then anecdotal evidence suggests that several services such as trade, tourism, airlines, the hospitality sector and construction have been further adversely impacted by the pandemic. Dislocations in casual and contract labour would result in losses of activity in other sectors as well. 9. Retail inflation, measured by the consumer price index, peaked in January 2020 and fell by a full percentage point in February 2020 to 6.6 per cent, as the ebbing of onion prices brought down food inflation from double digits in the preceding two months. Price pressures, however, remain firm across protein-rich items, edible oils and pulses; but the shock to demand from COVID-19 may weaken them going forward. While fuel inflation increased sharply in February on the back of the delayed domestic adjustment to international LPG prices, the plunge in international crude prices in March may bring a measure of relief to the extent it is allowed to pass-through. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel eased in February under the weight of softer prices of transport and communication, and personal care. Households\u2019 inflation expectations a year ahead softened by 20 bps in the March 2020 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey. 10. Domestic financial conditions have tightened considerably, with equity markets facing massive sell-offs by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). In the bond market too, yields have risen on sustained FPI selling, while redemption pressures, drop in trading activity and generalised risk aversion have pushed up yields to elevated levels in commercial paper, corporate bond and other fixed income segments. In the forex market, the Indian rupee (INR) has been under continuous downward pressure. Under these conditions, the Reserve Bank has endeavoured to keep financial markets liquid, stable and functioning normally. Systemic liquidity surplus, as reflected in net absorptions under the LAF, averaged \u20b92.86 lakh crore in March (up to March 25, 2020). In addition, the Reserve Bank undertook unconventional operations in the form of auctions of what is called \u2018operation twist\u2019 involving the simultaneous sale of short-term government securities (of \u20b928,276 crore) and purchase of long-term securities (of \u20b940,000 crore), cumulatively injecting a 3 net amount of \u20b911,724 crore. The Reserve Bank also conducted five long term repo auctions of 1 year and 3 years tenors of a cumulative amount of \u20b91.25 lakh crore so far to inject liquidity and improve monetary transmission. It also conducted two sell-buy swap auctions to inject cumulatively US dollar liquidity into the forex market to the tune of US$ 2.71 billion on March 16 and 23. Open market purchase operations of \u20b910,000 crore on March 20 and \u20b915,000 crore each on March 24 and March 26 have been conducted to bolster liquidity and smoothen financial conditions. 11. In the external sector, merchandise exports expanded in February 2020 after posting six consecutive months of contraction. Import growth also moved into positive territory after eight months of continuous decline. Consequently, the trade deficit widened marginally on a year-on-year basis although it was lower than its level a month ago. On March 12, the Reserve Bank released balance of payments data which showed the current account having moved to near balance in Q3:2019-20 with a deficit of only 0.2 per cent of GDP. On the financing side, net FDI inflows at US$ 37.8 billion during April- January 2019-20 were substantially higher than a year ago. Portfolio investment recorded net outflows of US$ 5.2 billion during 2019-20 (up to March 25), down from US$ 6.6 billion a year ago. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves reached a level of US$ 487.2 billion on March 6, 2020 \u2013 an increase of US$ 74.4 billion over their end-March 2019 level. Outlook 12. In the sixth bi-monthly resolution of February 2020, CPI headline inflation was projected at 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20. The prints for January and February 2020 indicate that actual outcomes for the quarter are running 30 bps above projections, reflecting the onion price shock. Looking ahead, food prices may soften even further under the beneficial effects of the record foodgrains and horticulture production, at least till the onset of the usual summer uptick. Furthermore, the collapse in crude prices should work towards easing both fuel and core inflation pressures, depending on the level of the pass-through to retail prices. As a consequence of COVID-19, aggregate demand may weaken and ease core inflation further. Heightened volatility in financial markets could also have a bearing on inflation. 13. Turning to growth, apart from the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities, most other sectors of the economy will be adversely impacted by the pandemic, depending upon its intensity, spread and duration. If COVID-19 is prolonged and supply chain disruptions get accentuated, the global slowdown could deepen, with adverse implications for India. The slump in international crude prices could, however, provide some relief in the form of terms of trade gains. Downside risks to growth arise from the spread of COVID-19 and prolonged lockdowns. Upside growth impulses are expected to emanate from monetary, fiscal and other policy measures and the early containment of COVID-19. The MPC is of the view that macroeconomic risks, both on the demand and supply 14. sides, brought on by the pandemic could be severe. The need of the hour is to do whatever is necessary to shield the domestic economy from the pandemic. Central banks across the world have responded with monetary and regulatory measures \u2013 both conventional and unconventional. Governments across the world have unleashed massive fiscal measures, including targeted health services support, to protect economic activity from the impact of the virus. To mitigate the economic difficulties arising out of the virus outbreak, the Government of India has announced a comprehensive package of \u20b91.70 lakh crore, covering cash transfers and food security, for vulnerable sections of society, including farmers, migrant workers, urban and rural poor, differently abled persons and women. The MPC notes that the Reserve Bank has taken several measures to inject substantial liquidity in the system. Nonetheless, the priority is to undertake strong and purposeful action in order to minimise the adverse macroeconomic impact of the pandemic. It is in this context that the MPC unanimously votes for a sizable reduction in the policy repo rate, but with some differences in the quantum of reduction. Furthermore, the MPC also notes that the Reserve Bank has decided to undertake several measures to further improve liquidity, monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy and provide relief on debt servicing. It also underscores the need for all stakeholders to fight against the pandemic. Banks and other financial institutions should do all they can to keep credit flowing to economic agents facing financial stress on account of the isolation that the virus has imposed. Market participants should work with regulators like the Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to ensure the orderly functioning of markets in their role of price discovery and financial intermediation. Strong fiscal measures are critical to deal with the situation. 15. All members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. 16. Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Janak Raj, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a 75 bps reduction in the policy repo rate. Dr. Chetan Ghate and Dr. Pami Dua voted for a 50 bps reduction in the policy repo rate. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by April 13, 2020. Voting on the Resolution to reduce the policy repo rate 18. I remain data dependent\u201d In the last review, I had said \u201cWhile I don\u2019t see space for further cuts going forward, In the last six weeks, the data has turned in a significant way. 20. Because of COVID-19, acute downside risks to growth have mounted. As lockdown measures kick-in, the economic cost of COVID-19 could become large as production declines in various sectors, and there is a permanent postponement of consumption expenditure plans. 5 21. A large decline in global growth will also affect our exports adversely. Growth in the service sector, the largest sector in the economy, will also be affected because discretionary spending will fall. It is important to understand that consumer services \u2013 retail, hotels, restaurants etc. \u2013 are a corollary of growth. In contrast, producer services \u2013 finance, IT, Real Estate, Transportation etc. - are producers of growth and also employment. COVID-19 will impact both, slowing the momentum on the growth turnaround that had set in in the last few months. 22. Unfortunately, there is no short-cut at the current juncture apart from the lockdown. 23. What should the monetary policy strategy be in this situation? There are three considerations. 24. First, monetary policy should minimize the fall in aggregate demand, i.e., we should minimize the extent of permanent damage done to growth by the COVID-19 shock. Hence, the required cut in the policy rate should be large given the severity of the shock. What is required is in the nature of an insurance cut. 25. In a demand deficient economy, a large rate cut, however, will be akin to pushing on a string. I have been raising this concern in several previous policy reviews justifying the need for more structural reforms. This concern prevents me from voting for an even larger cut in the policy rate this time. 26. Second, what is the appropriate division of labor between monetary policy, liquidity policy, social insurance policy, and fiscal policy in stimulating aggregate demand? 27. I see the current fiscal stimulus (1.7 lakh crore which is about 0.8% of GDP, announced on March 26, 2020) more in the nature or a relief measure (social insurance) rather than a stimulus. A relief is not a permanent fix. The idea of the measure announced by the government is to weather the storm so that no one has to go without food and spending on essential items. The effect of this measure will be to lead to a small rise in consumption in the short run, but the effect will dissipate quickly. 28. On liquidity policy, a large number of measures will be announced today which include prudential and forbearance measures. A series of liquidity measures have already been enacted (Forex swaps, LTROs, operation twist, OMOs). Combined, these measures amount to a \u201ccarpet-bombing\u201d of the financial system with liquidity and will help flatten yields in those parts of the financial system where fire-sales have pushed up credit spreads. The stabilization of financial markets will help improve economic outcomes. 29. On fiscal policy, I await details on a second stimulus package that will possibly be announced by the government. The challenge will be this: estimates of the size of the government spending multiplier internationally across a wide variety of studies, unless the economy has a lot of slack or is stuck at the zero lower bound, tend to be small, and typically smaller than one (an increase in Government spending by 100 Rs. increases GDP by less than 100 Rs.). Tax multipliers, on the other hand, tend to be larger (greater than one). This suggests that the ideal fiscal stimulus to deal with COVID-19 should be loaded on the tax side rather than the government spending side. India however has limited tax penetration. This is going to be the main design challenge. Finally, what is the threat to our medium term inflation aim because of the COVID- 30. 19 shock? 31. While it is hard to assess -- in a precise manner -- the one year ahead level of inflation given the current situation, new disinflationary forces have emerged since the last review, namely, an outsized reduction in crude because of geo-political factors, and a possible acute slowdown in growth in FY: 20-21. Inflation ex-food and fuel could also fall with lower crude prices and with an opening up of the output gap. 32. I worry though that even though vegetable inflation has fallen sharply from 50% in January 2020, it is still elevated at about 30% in February. Unseasonal rains, if any, and COVID-19 related lasting supply side disruptions in the food sector also pose an upside risk to the inflation trajectory in 2020-21. These need to be carefully watched. Taking monetary policy, fiscal policy, social insurance policy, and liquidity policy 33. together, a 50 bps cut in the policy rate is appropriate at the current juncture. 34. As noted recently by former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in an AER article, monetary policy has never proved able to reverse large shocks. It only helps to mitigate the worse effects of shocks, and speeds up the recovery. 35. Once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, is there likely to be a quick return to normal? I am hopeful because production capacity has not been destroyed. However, I will watch the incoming growth-inflation data carefully, and remain data dependent. I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative. The near nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak has brought 37. economic activity to almost a standstill. The global economy has also been adversely impacted by the unprecedented economic and humanitarian crisis, the severity of which will depend on the depth, duration and diffusion of the evolving pandemic. 38. Depending on the severity of the situation and the duration of the lockdown, the crisis has ramifications for domestic growth stemming from supply side disruptions, contraction in demand, slowdown in global growth and a loss in consumer confidence as well as investor sentiment. The supply chain of key industries is likely to be disrupted due to restricted access to imported raw materials. The manufacturing sector is expected to drastically slow down due to closure of factories while consumer demand and investment spending are also likely to drop sharply. The services sector is expected to be impacted the most due to restrictions on travel, transport, hospitality, tourism, and professional and financial services. Construction activity is also expected to drop. Trade is expected to take a hit due to a fall in domestic demand and contraction in global growth. Since the shock to output is global, it is unlikely that any country can act as an engine of growth to pull the world out of this situation. 39. According to the second advance estimates of the NSO released in February 2020, GDP growth print for Q3: 2019-20 was 4.7% and is expected to be 5% for the full FY 2019-20. However, this may be difficult to achieve due to the negative impact of the coronavirus disease, which gained momentum in February in the country. The slowdown in economic activity poses challenges for financial stability, 40. especially in the wake of recent development in one private sector bank. Financial conditions have also become tight, with massive sell-offs by foreign portfolio investors in the debt and equity markets. For the same reason, the Indian rupee has also come under downward pressure. However, the Reserve Bank has done well to take various steps to inject large liquidity into the system and ensure stability in the financial markets. 41. On the inflation front, the trajectory of headline CPI inflation is heading downwards, with easing of food prices in the light of record foodgrains and horticulture production. The collapse in crude oil prices and weakening aggregate demand are expected to soften inflation further. 42. Thus, depending on the depth, duration and diffusion of the crisis, the risks to economic growth on both the supply and demand sides could be significant. Fortunately, in the current scenario, inflation is expected to remain soft and does not pose as a major challenge. The top-most priority, therefore, is to minimise the negative impact of the pandemic on economic growth. This necessitates a multi-pronged approach comprising monetary, fiscal and other policy measures, as well as steps to contain the spread of COVID-19. 43. The Reserve Bank has already taken several measures to inject substantial liquidity into the system. It is also widening the existing policy rate LAF corridor to incentivize banks to use funds for lending, instead of parking them with RBI. The Reserve Bank has also decided to undertake several measures to further improve liquidity, monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy, and provide relief on debt servicing. The Government of India has also announced a comprehensive fiscal package covering cash transfers and food security for vulnerable sections of society. Fiscal policy has a major role to play in combating the economic effects of the pandemic. 44. Given the extraordinary crisis, in order to revive growth and mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19, a sizable reduction in the policy repo rate is clearly warranted. Accordingly, I vote for cutting the policy rate by 50 basis points. In the current scenario, with heightened uncertainty and a near-standstill in economic activity, this may not necessarily lead to an increase in borrowing, but should raise consumer confidence and investor sentiment, going forward. It may be better to conserve some policy space for later, when those binding constraints are removed and the economy will require a further boost to recover from the pandemic. I also vote to maintain the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth. These are truly exceptional times. Health hazards created by the spread of COVID- 45. 19 all over the globe are pushing the world economy into unprecedented recession. At the time of the previous meeting of MPC in early February 2020, the Indian economy was on the path of recovery from the growth slow down. Nobody expected that COVID-19 would hit India and so many other countries so soon and potentially so devastatingly that most of the production and economic activities would come to a grinding halt. Prolonged lock-down has seriously adverse economic and social implications. These external shocks are from both the supply and demand sides. Both producers and consumers, and hence investors and savers, are losing confidence and even hope. Under such unprecedented circumstances, governments in all countries have come up with policy measures on both fiscal and monetary fronts to provide a substantial booster dose, putting aside all other concerns like inflation and fiscal discipline. In any case, going forward, CPI inflation in India four quarters ahead is most likely to be well below the targeted 4 per cent. Therefore, remaining within the mandate given by the Act, this is the right time for MPC to act decisively and for RBI to provide a major booster dose to the economy basically to restore confidence of producers, consumers, investors and savers. In my opinion, there is enough space for a major rate cut and other liquidity and regulatory measures. I, therefore, vote for a 75 bps cut to begin with in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance. More precise reasons for my vote are as follows \u2013 i) The second advance estimate of GDP growth during 2019-20 by NSO published on 28th February 2020 has to be adjusted downwards because of the sudden adverse impact of COVID-19 from March 2020. In my opinion, the Q4:2019-20 growth would be around 3.5% instead of 4.7% and hence the GDP growth for the year 2019-20 is likely to be around 4.7% instead of 5% as predicted by the NSO. Although there are significant uncertainties about the impact of the Coronavirus, based on various scenarios, it is possible to have a conservative prediction range of GDP growth for the next year (2020-21). Accordingly I believe that GDP growth in the whole year 2020-21 would be less, but not substantially less, than the one observed during the current year and may be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. The output gap would, therefore, continue to expand and exert downward pressure on the inflation ex-food and fuel. Looking to the international economic prospects in view of the devastating impact of COVID-19 and the response of the oil producers, the fuel prices are likely to remain depressed in the range of $25-40. Even when we consider that the entire fall may not get transmitted to the domestic market, the inflation in petroleum product prices may show a sharp declining trend over the next four quarters. iii) Rabi crop has been a bumper crop and assuming a normal monsoon next year, food prices are expected to show a sharp declining trend over the next four quarters. iv) Thus, headline CPI inflation by Q4:2020-21 is expected to be only around 2.5%. This makes the current real policy repo rate unduly high when the most of the comparator countries have cut their real policy rates to the zero or negative territory. It is time to correct our real policy rates substantially. v) Concerns about transmission of policy rate cuts are already addressed by the policy of external bench-marking of the lending rates by banks in respect of MSME, retail and housing loans. vi) The Central Government has already started providing fiscal boost and may continue doing so to revive the economy. In my opinion, MPC and RBI must complement the efforts by providing a major 46. boost. Fortunately, both have enough space on policy rates and liquidity and regulatory forbearance aspects for such exceptional times unlike several Central Banks of the West. This is the time for RBI to: reduce the Reverse Repo Rate further by widening the corridor thereby discouraging banks to park their excess liquidity with RBI and encouraging them to get into the corporate bond market; stop the clock for 3-4 months for recognition of defaults and downgrades to reduce panic and provide support; reduce SLR substantially to overcome liquidity crunch for credit expansion and such other measures. In order to provide a major boost through MPC, I vote to cut the policy Repo Rate by 75 bps this time. There is still enough space for the policy rate cut as and when required to support growth recovery going forward since inflation is likely to be under control. In recent weeks, there has been a drastic change in the global and domestic 47. macroeconomic scenarios. Coronavirus (COVID-19) has crippled global supply chains and disrupted economic activity in many countries. The outbreak of coronavirus initially began as a supply shock, but it soon also became a demand shock with restrictions on travel, tourism, and cut back in non-essential spending due to lockdowns. Reflecting the severe impact that the COVID-19 is expected to have on the global economy, financial markets have been witnessing turbulence. 48. The authorities in many countries, including central banks, have unleashed conventional and unconventional measures to mitigate the adverse macroeconomic impact of the pandemic. Despite massive easing by central banks, however, global financing conditions have tightened due to a flight to safety. That there has been so much flight for safety and demand for liquidity that there has been large selling even in gold, pulling down its prices, which normally rise in an uncertain environment. 49. Since the pandemic is still spreading and its impact deepening, the estimates for downward drag on global growth are continuously being revised. However, it is now clear that global growth in 2020 is likely to be much weaker than that in 2019. As the COVID- 19 pandemic has impacted advanced and emerging economies alike due to lockdowns and impaired supply chains, there is, in fact, a serious risk that the global economy will even slip into recession in 2020. In the face of slowing down of global growth, huge global debt accumulated after the global financial crisis may also pose serious threats to global financial stability. 50. Moving on to the domestic economy, economic activity appeared to have picked up some pace as reflected in several indicators in January/February such as growth in IIP, including manufacturing; railways freight traffic; tractor sales; and credit to micro and small industries. Both exports and imports also turned positive in February. PMI manufacturing in January and PMI composite in February were at eight-year high. However, these past data have become less relevant as the near-term outlook has turned highly uncertain caused by COVID-19, the spread, strength and length of which are unknown at this stage. 51. Various segments of the financial market have become extremely volatile and trading volumes have declined, pushing yields across the spectrum of yield curve. The domestic equity market has plummeted in the face of massive sell-offs by foreign portfolio investors. On the whole, domestic financial conditions have tightened and could seriously undermine monetary transmission, which otherwise improved in the more recent period. 52. While initially it was the civil aviation, hospitality and entertainment sectors which were hit by COVID-19, now with a 21-day nation-wide lockdown, most sectors will take a hit in Q4: 2019-20 and Q1:2020-21. The number of infected cases is relatively still low in India. And with the nation-wide lockdown if the spread is contained, life could slowly start returning to normalcy and the economy could also start recovering gradually. However, growth for the year as a whole is likely to be weak for three reasons. First, discretionary spending by households is likely to be curtailed in general even though there could be some pent-up demand in some sectors. Second, external demand will remain weak, impacting our exports. Third, weak domestic and external demand is likely to cause a 10 Inflation declined by 100 bps in February, pulled down by vegetables, especially 53. onion. However, with a lockdown, there may be some near-term pressure on prices in many food items. Beyond near-term, food inflation is expected to moderate on arrival of the bumper rabi harvest. Fuel group inflation is likely to decline significantly with a large fall in global LPG prices. CPI inflation ex food and fuel is expected to remain soft on account of two factors: (i) a slowdown in demand; and (ii) a sharp decline in international crude oil prices, which will not only have a direct impact on petroleum product prices, but also on input prices in many industries. However, the decline in domestic pump and LPG prices will occur only to the extent the pass-through takes place. On the whole, the inflation outlook appears to have become benign. Collection of comprehensive CPI data during the period of lockdown would be challenging, which may, therefore, hamper a clearer assessment of the price situation for immediate months. 54. On the whole, it has been hard to clearly assess the macroeconomic outlook at this point of time. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a series of a priori indistinguishable shocks \u2013 a sharp slowdown in global demand, volatility in financial markets, a sharp fall in crude oil prices, and virtual freeze of global trade and travel. All these factors have generated unforeseen volatility in several macroeconomic and financial variables \u2013 identification of which for modelling purposes is practically impossible. Furthermore, assigning probabilities on outcomes in times of infrequent but high-impact events such as the COVID-19 pandemic for projection purposes is extremely daunting. 55. To sum up, there is an unprecedented uncertainty about the exact impact COVID- 19 will have on the near-term growth outlook. Though difficult to quantify, it is clear that aggregate demand will weaken significantly in the near future, which will impact the growth prospects for the year as a whole. Therefore, the main challenge for monetary policy at this juncture is to ensure that the adverse impact of COVID-19 on domestic demand is not amplified. It is also necessary to make sure that financial markets, which have been under stress with yields hardening across the maturity spectrum, do not intensify macroeconomic risks by impairing monetary transmission and giving rise to financial stability risks. Beyond the immediate future and once the situation starts normalising, domestic demand would need to be stimulated without any loss of time. The inflation outlook has improved significantly. Keeping in view these considerations, the need of the hour is to effect a sizeable reduction in the policy rate. I, therefore, vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 75 basis points. The reduction in the policy rate together with several other liquidity enhancing measures being separately announced by the Reserve Bank should ease financing conditions and address financial stability risks. I also vote for persevering with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 56. The corona virus\u2019s danse macabre is taking a catastrophic toll on human lives. Economic dislocation is severe, and markets are in turmoil. Affected nations have taken wide-ranging health services support, stabilisation and regulatory measures to ease the conduct of financial and economic activity and try to alleviate the destruction wrought by the pandemic. Global growth projections are being slashed and the world economy appears to be staring at a deep recession, but the full effects of the losses incurred are still unknown, especially as expectations that the virus outbreak would be contained in the first quarter of 2020 have been belied. 57. India has locked down and a state of siege prevails. Several types of activity have come to a standstill with social isolation, supply disruptions, demand contraction and heightened anxiety. The outlook for the economy is highly uncertain and shifts with every incoming data on the impact of the virus. Prospects for the Indian economy now hinge around how pervasive and severe COVID-19 turns out to be, and how long it lasts. 58. In these challenging circumstances, monetary policy has to assume an avant garde role. Even as it fights the corrosive impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic and financial conditions, monetary policy has to provide confidence and assuage fear. This involves easing financing conditions for people and institutions, keeping finance flowing to all agents in the economy, ensuring that markets do not freeze up, providing the assurance that the Reserve Bank of India is at the forefront in the war against COVID-19 and will use all instruments at its command to fight the virus and mitigate its fall out. It is important, however, to emphasise that COVID-19 is a global crisis and warrants action beyond the remit of monetary policy, within the country, and across the world. 59. In my minutes in February 2020, I had stated that \u201cthe coronavirus outbreak has imparted new and uncertain risks in response to which the world is grappling to fashion a credible response.\u201d My sense at that time was that the MPC has entered a tunnel of testing trade-offs (TTT) and it may be a while before the light at the end of the tunnel is sighted. Today, as that prognosis materialises with disturbing intensity, I believe that the MPC is being called upon to rise beyond its mandate. The MPC must show the way with the powerful decision that it wields. By doing so, it will leverage and catalyse the Reserve Bank into the battlefront role that has to be undertaken for the greater common good. It is in this context that the rate decision of the MPC has to be significant enough to reach various troubled sectors and ease their financing constraints decisively as well as transmit positive announcement effects across the economy to dispel gloom and instil confidence. 60. Accordingly, I vote for a reduction in the policy rate and for maintaining an accommodative policy stance for as long as necessary to fight COVID-19 and revive growth. What should be the size of the reduction? Inflation has peaked and will likely ease well below the target in the second half of 2020-21. In the extreme scenario in which we are, however, the easing off of inflation may occur sooner and faster. In terms of the primary mandate given to the MPC, this outlook offers the scope for taking a calculated risk on current levels of inflation \u2013 which rule above the target \u2013 and focus on the 12 months ahead forecast. By this rule, there is space for policy action that is large in size relative to its past but still keeps the policy rate positive in real terms over a one year ahead horizon so as to see off any lingering or latent inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, the output gap is widening and may become pronouncedly negative as the situation evolves. In order to address these macroeconomic challenges, ease financial conditions substantially and infuse confidence, I vote for a cut in the policy rate of 75 basis points. COVID-19 is a global danger; our defence must be collective and coordinated even with social distancing. All stakeholders must muster inner strength and determination to stay the course and fight the scourge. 12 61. The global macroeconomic situation has abruptly worsened in the last fortnight or so and the authorities and central banks in many countries have deployed an extensive range of targeted policy instruments to deal with the macroeconomic fallout of COVID- 19, caused by lockdowns and social distancing. The outbreak of COVID-19 has seriously dented global growth prospects. Across the world, activity has come to a near standstill. There is a rising probability of a global recession, which may be deeper than the one experienced during the global financial crisis. 62. In India also, the near-term growth outlook has deteriorated sharply: initially reflecting global spillovers and the amplification of the impact of COVID-19; and thereafter, due to the much needed efforts mounted by the Government to contain the pandemic by declaring a nationwide lockdown of 21 days up to April 14, 2020. Prior to the outbreak, some high frequency indicators such as manufacturing, railway freight traffic, exports and imports in January/February had improved after several months of contraction/deceleration. With COVID-19, however, industry and service sector activities are likely to be severely impacted and the extent of the adverse impact would depend upon the intensity, spread and duration of COVID-19. The only silver lining is likely to be agriculture, which is expected to remain resilient, with foodgrains production for 2019-20 estimated (second advance estimates or SAE) at a record 292 million tonnes \u2013 3.8 per cent higher than the SAE for 2018-19. The setback to economic activity could be cushioned, to an extent, by the collapse in crude oil prices; but there could be certain downsides in the form of decline in remittances from oil producing countries. 63. On the inflation front, the outlook has changed drastically. The inflation print for February 2020 softened by 100 basis points to 6.6 per cent from 7.6 per cent in January. Going forward, inflation outcomes are likely to be shaped significantly by COVID-19 and the sharp fall in oil prices. Food prices may also soften further on the back of record foodgrains and horticulture production. The usual uptick that begins in summer months may remain subdued if demand conditions take longer to normalise. The weakening of domestic aggregate demand may also help to contain core inflation. 64. The Reserve Bank has been proactively managing liquidity in the system. Overall liquidity in the system continued to remain in large surplus at close to \u20b93.0 lakh crore on an average per day in February and March 2020 so far. With a view to facilitating monetary transmission, the Reserve Bank conducted five long term repo operations (LTRO) between February 17 and March 18, 2020 for one-year and three-year tenors aggregating \u20b91.25 lakh crore. In order to ease financial conditions, which had tightened due to a sharp drop in trading volumes and consequent illiquidity, the Reserve Bank has taken several measures to inject further substantial liquidity in the system such as (i) conducting two 6-month US$ sell/buy swap auctions on March 16 and March 23, 2020 cumulatively injecting dollar liquidity of US$ 2.71 billion; (ii) injecting \u20b940,000 crore through three open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions on March 20, 24 and 26, 2020; (iii) injecting \u20b977,745 crore through two fine-tuning variable rate 16-day repos on March 23 and 24, 2020; and (iv) injecting \u20b911,772 crore through one fine-tuning variable rate repo auction of 12-days maturity on March 26. 65. The COVID-19 pandemic is an invisible assassin which needs to be contained quickly before it spreads and wreaks havoc on valuable human lives and the macro economy. In this scenario, it is important to ensure that finance, which is the lifeline of the economy, keeps flowing seamlessly to various sectors of the economy. It is comforting that the macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy continue to be sound, especially in comparison with the conditions that prevailed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. 66. We are living through an extraordinary time and the situation currently facing the country is unprecedented. It, therefore, becomes imperative to make all-out efforts to protect the domestic economy from the adverse impact of the pandemic. The Government has announced several measures to protect the vulnerable sections of society. The Reserve Bank is undertaking measures almost on a daily basis to provide relief and financial accommodation to various segments of the economy. The path to normalisation of activity, however, is contingent on how India\u2019s COVID-19 epidemiological curve evolves, amidst heightened uncertainty. Growth impulses face strong headwinds from sluggish aggregate demand and disruptions in supply of labour and key inputs, including imports. The erosion of consumer confidence and investment sentiment can operate in an adverse feedback loop to worsen the growth outlook even further. In this emerging scenario, monetary policy needs to proactively arrest any deterioration in aggregate demand, and thereby create enabling conditions for businesses to normalise production and supply chains as and when the situation becomes conducive for resumption of economic activity. The space for policy action has opened up in view of the disinflationary effects of deceleration in demand under the impact of COVID-19. Weaker overall demand outlook and lower crude oil prices should keep upside risks to inflation firmly contained, even in the face of temporary supply chain disruptions and scope for opportunistic use of pricing power. Arresting risks to the growth outlook and preserving financial stability should, accordingly, receive the highest priority. Considering all these aspects, I vote for reducing the policy repo rate by a sizable 75 basis points and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. The substantial rate cut, along with several other regulatory and liquidity augmenting measures being announced as a part of developmental and regulatory policies today, convey the resolve of the Reserve Bank to deal with the macroeconomic fallout of COVID- 19 pre-emptively. The Reserve Bank will continue to remain vigilant and will not hesitate to use any instrument \u2013 conventional and unconventional \u2013 to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, revive growth and preserve financial stability. Press Release : 2019-2020/2207 Chief General Manager ", "May_2020": "The twenty third meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from May 20 to 22, 2020; the meeting was originally scheduled from June 3 to 5, 2020, but was advanced to May 20-22 in view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 2.

The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic 5. situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (May 22, 2020) decided to:  accordingly, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate  stand reduced to 4.25 per cent from 4.65 per cent; and the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced to 3.35 per cent from 3.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Since the MPC met in March 2020, global economic activity has remained in 6. standstill under COVID-19 related lockdowns and social distancing. Among the key advanced economies (AEs), economic activity contracted in the US, Euro area, Japan and the UK in Q1:2020. Among emerging market economies (EMEs), the Chinese economy went into a pronounced decline and data on high frequency indicators suggest that activity may have also shrunk in other EMEs such as Brazil and South Africa. Global financial markets calmed after a turbulent period in March, and volatility 7. ebbed as swift and large fiscal and monetary policy responses helped to soothe sentiment. Equity markets recovered some lost ground, while government bond yields remained range-bound, although somewhat elevated in some EMEs due to country- specific factors. Portfolio flows to EMEs revived in April and the rush to safe havens eased. With the US dollar weakening, major EME currencies, which had experienced persistent downward pressure, traded with an appreciating bias. Crude oil prices firmed up modestly as oil producing countries (OPEC plus) agreed to cut production, and prospects for revival in demand improved on expectations of imminent easing of lockdowns. Gold prices remained elevated on hedging demand. CPI inflation remained subdued across major AEs and EMEs primarily due to a collapse in oil prices and compression in demand amidst lockdowns, while food inflation picked up due to supply disruptions. 8. Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by the lockdown which has extended over the past two months. High frequency indicators point to a collapse in demand beginning March 2020 across both urban and rural segments. Electricity consumption has plunged, while both investment activity and private consumption suffered precipitous declines, as reflected in the collapse in capital goods production and the large retrenchment in the output of consumer durables and non-durables in March. High frequency indicators of service sector activity such as passenger and commercial vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals also experienced sizable contractions in March. The only silver lining was provided by agriculture, with the summer sowing of rice, pulses and oilseeds in the country progressing well, with total area sown under the current kharif season up by 43.5 per cent so far, and the rabi harvest promising to be a bumper as reflected in record procurement. 9. Retail inflation, measured by the consumer price index, moderated for the second consecutive month in March 2020 to 5.8 per cent after peaking in January. This was mainly due to food inflation easing from double digits in December 2019 \u2013 January 2020. In April, however, supply disruptions took a toll and reversed the softening of food inflation, which surged to 8.6 per cent from 7.8 per cent in March. Prices of vegetables, cereals, milk, pulses and edible oils and sugar emerged as pressure points1. 10. The Reserve Bank remained in pro-active liquidity management mode, expanding its array of measures, both conventional and unconventional, to augment system-level liquidity as also to channel liquidity to specific sectors facing funding constraints. Systemic liquidity remained in abundance, with average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) increasing to \u20b95.66 lakh crore in May 2020 (up to May 20) from \u20b94.75 lakh crore in April. During 2020-21 (up to May 20), \u20b91,20,474 crore was injected through open market operation (OMO) purchases and \u20b987,891 crore through three targeted long-term repo operation (TLTRO) auctions and one TLTRO 2.0 auction. In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the yield curve, the Reserve Bank conducted one \u2018operation twist\u2019 auction involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for \u20b910,000 crore each on April 27, 2020. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank has provided \u20b922,334 crore as refinance to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and National Housing Bank (NHB) so far (as on May 21, 2020) and \u20b92,430 crore to mutual funds through a special liquidity facility (SLF) with a view to easing liquidity constraints and de-stress financial markets. Since February 6, 2020 the Reserve Bank has announced liquidity augmenting measures of \u20b99.42 lakh crore (4.6 per cent of GDP). 11. Reflecting the various liquidity management measures, domestic financial conditions have eased appreciably as reflected in the narrowing of liquidity premia in various market segments. Yields on government securities, commercial paper (CP), 91-day treasury bills, certificates of deposit (CDs) and corporate bonds have softened. The weighted average lending rates on fresh rupee loans of commercial banks declined by 43 bps in March 2020 alone. Though credit growth remains muted, scheduled commercial banks\u2019 investments in commercial paper, bonds, debentures and shares of corporate bodies in this year so far (up to May 8) increased sharply by \u20b966,757 crore as against a decline of \u20b98,822 crore during the same period last year. There were net inflows into various schemes of mutual funds in April in contrast to large outflows in March. In the external sector, India\u2019s merchandise trade slumped in April 2020, with 12. exports shrinking by 60.3 per cent and imports by 58.6 per cent (y-o-y), respectively. While imports contracted in all 30 commodity groups in April, exports contracted in 28 out of 30 groups. The trade deficit narrowed in April 2020 \u2013 both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis \u2013 to its lowest level in 47 months. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment inflows picked up in March 2020 to US$ 2.9 billion from US$ 0.8 billion a year ago. In 2020-21 so far (till May 18), net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in equities increased to US$ 1.2 billion from US$ 0.8 billion a year ago. In the debt segment, however, there were portfolio outflows of US$ 3.8 billion during the same period as compared with outflows of US$ 1.4 billion a year ago. By contrast, net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US$ 0.7 billion during the same period. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have increased by US$ 9.2 billion in 2020-21 so far (up to May 15) to US$ 487.0 billion \u2013 equivalent to 12 months of imports. The inflation outlook is highly uncertain. As supply lines get restored in the 13. coming months with gradual relaxations in the lockdown, the unusual spike in food inflation in April is expected to moderate. The forecast of a normal monsoon also portends well for food inflation. Given the current global demand-supply balance, international crude oil prices are likely to remain low although they may firm up from the recent depressed levels. Soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw materials are likely to keep input costs low for domestic firms. Deficient demand may hold down pressures on core inflation (excluding food and fuel), although persisting supply dislocations impart uncertainty to the near term outlook. However, volatility in financial markets could have a bearing on inflation. These factors, combined with favourable base effects, are expected to take effect and pull down headline inflation below target in Q3 and Q4 of 2020-21. 14. Turning to the growth outlook, economic activity other than agriculture is likely to remain depressed in Q1:2020-21 in view of the extended lockdown. Even though the lockdown may be lifted by end-May with some restrictions, economic activity even in Q2 may remain subdued due to social distancing measures and the temporary shortage of labour. Recovery in economic activity is expected to begin in Q3 and gain momentum in Q4 as supply lines are gradually restored to normalcy and demand gradually revives. For the year as a whole, there is still heightened uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and how long social distancing measures are likely to remain in place and consequently, downside risks to domestic growth remain significant. On the other hand, upside impulses could be unleashed if the pandemic is contained, and social distancing measures are phased out faster. 15. The MPC is of the view that the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated, and various sectors of the economy are experiencing acute stress. The impact of the shock has been compounded by the interaction of supply disruptions and demand compression. Beyond the destruction of economic and financial activity, livelihood and health are severely affected. Even as various measures initiated by the Government and the Reserve Bank work to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on the economy, it is necessary to ease financial conditions further. This will facilitate the flow of funds at affordable rates and revive animal spirits. With the inflation outlook remaining benign as lockdown-related supply disruptions are mended, the policy space to address growth concerns needs to be used now rather than later to support the economy, even while maintaining headroom to back up the revival of activity when it takes hold. 16. Accordingly, all members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. 17. Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Janak Raj, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 40 bps, while Dr. Chetan Ghate voted for a reduction by 25 bps. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by June 5, 2020. Voting on the Resolution to reduce the policy repo rate 19. Since the last review, the outlook for the economy has deteriorated further. 20. Several high frequency indicators point to dire growth outcomes in the near term. On COVID-19, we haven\u2019t achieved the first goal, which is flattening of the curve. The \u201ctug of war\u201d between economic and health costs has led to some opening up of the economy. The economy needs to be opened up smartly. The risk of prematurely opening the economy is that there could be a surge in new cases. It takes time for local epidemics to grow. The main growth challenge is that the top six industrialized states produce 62% of India\u2019s GDP. These are also the worst affected states by COVID. 21. Despite the dire growth outcomes, why have I voted for a 25 bps cut, and not a larger amount? 22. First, it is not entirely clear to me that Covid-19 constitutes a large disinflationary shock. Inflationary pressures fall with economic slack (the output gap), but rise with expected future inflation and factors related to production costs. 23. Both 3-month ahead and 1-year ahead inflationary expectations have spiked sharply (by 190 bps and 120 bps respectively) in the latest round of RBI\u2019s survey. This spike reverses a relatively flat trajectory for inflationary expectations over the past six rounds of surveys. It also reflects a sharp rise in food inflation in recent months. In April, food inflation rose to 8.6% from 7.8% in March, and will likely remain elevated in the coming months. This is worrisome. I continue to be concerned about declining market arrivals of food commodities because of COVID related supply side bottle- necks and their inflationary impact. 24. When the economy turns to the upside, the recovery in demand will be swift. There has already been a severe dislocation in domestic and global supply chains. It will take some time to for these to get resolved, and it is therefore likely that demand will recover faster than supply. 25. Currently, core inflation (inflation excluding food and fuel) continues to remain moderate, with the April readings (not released by the CSO) likely to have been similar to the March readings, or around 4%. Lower oil prices have not been passed on to consumers at the pump because of a sharp hike in Central excise duties and increases in VAT rates on petrol and diesel across States, cancelling out any beneficial effects of lower oil prices on core inflation. 26. Second, as I mentioned in the last review, in a demand deficient economy, a large rate cut is akin to pushing on a string. 27. For rate cuts to work, banks have to lend. Despite the large number of steps taken to improve the liquidity and functioning of credit markets, as of April 24 (the most recent data available), non-food credit growth on a y-o-y basis was at 6.5% on May 8, 2020, lower than 7.2% on April 10, 2020. Third, rate cuts should be seen as part other measures that have already been 28. taken with respect to liquidity policy, social insurance policy, and fiscal policy in dealing with the crisis. 29. Since the last review, a comprehensive fiscal stimulus has been announced, amounting to about 10% of GDP. The \u201cKeynesian component\u201d of the stimulus, i.e., the part that increases discretionary spending via fiscal policy is however around 1% of GDP. 30. An ambitious Keynesian fiscal stimulus was always going to have to navigate between Scylla and Charybdis: if the government spent too much on the discretionary part of the stimulus, the yield curve would have gotten thrashed, banks would have booked losses, and our credit rating would have gotten a downgrade. It would have also signalled that the government is giving up on its commitment to controlling inflation. If it spent too little, it risked a worsening of growth. To navigate the middle path, the government has focussed on much needed 31. structural reforms. This is prudent. The measured approach to the stimulus recognizes the government cannot spend its way to prosperity without implications for financial instability. 32. Despite the small Keynesian component of the stimulus however, taking into account the relaxation in state government borrowing limits, the combined state-centre fiscal deficit is still likely to rise to around 10-12% of GDP in FY 21. I doubt if the bond markets will shrug this off. That means transmission to credit markets will suffer, making a large rate cut pointless. What compounds this is the rising risk aversion in the financial system will get exacerbated by a looming spike in NPAs because of the loan and mortgage holidays announced. This will hinder transmission even more. 33. Fourth, since the last review, a variety of high frequency indicators have declined sharply. There has been a broad based and deep contraction in the March IIP (Index of Industrial Production) which fell to -16.7% from 4.6% in March. Passenger vehicle sales have plummeted. Consumer non-durables have fallen by -16%. Indicators of fixed investment have tanked: finished steel consumption has declined by -90.9%, and IIP Capital goods (which proxy for machinery and equipment) have also fallen by -35.6%. PMI manufacturing declined to 27.4 in April from 51.8 in March due to a sharp contraction in output and new export orders. The services PMI dropped to 5.4 in April from 49.3 in March due to a sharp fall in business activity. Exports have also fallen drastically by -60.3%. 34. While these have no doubt resulted in a large negative output gap, it is also true that potential output has also fallen. 35. The only silver lining is the agriculture sector. The current Rabi crop has done well. And the current summer sowing of crops (for rice, pulses, coarse cereals, and oilseeds) is higher by 43.7% over last year. 36. The strongest argument for a big rate cut would therefore be the dire growth outcomes because of COVID. However, such rate cuts should be saved for when the economy starts reviving, and not when we are in a lock-down. Rate cuts, assuming that there is transmission and banks lend, works most effectively when the economy is on the upside. The MPC should keep some gunpowder dry. 37. Fifth, the reverse repo rate has been cut thrice in succession to 3.35%. The idea behind the asymmetric cuts is to use the LAF corridor as an instrument of monetary policy. For all practical purposes the reverse repo rate is now the effective policy rate. I worry that the current quantum of liquidity will be difficult to unwind when things return back to normal. RBI\u2019s liquidity policy has helped stabilize financial markets, but lender of last resort policies, as is widely recognised, are not useful outside a crisis, and thus should not be viewed as part of normal monetary policy. 38. Given the above reasons, I vote to cut the policy rate by 25 bps this time. 39. data dependent. I will continue to watch the incoming growth-inflation data carefully, and remain I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative. The nationwide lockdown over the past two months due to the COVID-19 41. pandemic has severely impacted domestic economic activity, yielding a grim prognosis for the economy. This unprecedented and extraordinary economic and health crisis has also gravely affected the global economy with acute intensity and spread. 42. On the domestic inflation front, headline CPI inflation fell from 6.6 per cent in February 2020 to 5.8 per cent in March. For the month of April, only partial information has been released, providing the numbers for food inflation, which rose from 7.8 per cent in March to 8.6 per cent in April, with prices of vegetables, pulses, edible oils, milk and cereals being the prime drivers. However, low crude oil prices, soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw materials, and weakening aggregate demand are expected to soften inflation, although supply disruptions may impact inflation adversely. Overall, headline inflation is expected to ease in the second half of FY:2020-21 and fall below target. This also conforms with the May 2020 round of the Inflation Expectations Survey of Households conducted by the Reserve Bank of India that shows higher inflation expectations for the three-months-ahead forecasts compared to forecasts for the one-year-ahead horizon. 43. On the domestic output front, the evolving pandemic has had serious ramifications for domestic growth, which is crippled by a near-standstill in economic activity due to the lockdown and social distancing, leading to demand compression as well as supply disruptions. High frequency indicators of urban consumption demand \u2013 passenger vehicle sales, domestic passenger air traffic and consumer durables \u2013 fell dramatically in March 2020. A similar dismal picture emerges in indicators of rural demand \u2013 tractors sales, motorcycle sales and consumer non-durables \u2013 that plunged sharply in the same period. Indicators of fixed investment also fell, with a sharp drop in finished steel consumption in April and cement production in March, reflecting a slowdown in construction activity. Moreover, capital goods production (as per the use- based classification of IIP) declined by 36 per cent in March, along with a significant drop in capital goods imports during March and April. While the data for the March print of IIP has been compiled with limited sample due to the institution of the lockdown from March 25, the preliminary data indicates a drop in IIP by almost 17 per cent, with manufacturing falling by more than 20 per cent, infrastructure/construction goods by almost 24 per cent and electricity by 6.8 per cent. 44. The Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing declined sharply to its lowest level of 27.4 in April from 51.8 in March, partly due to contraction in output and new exports orders. The PMI for services dropped dramatically to an unprecedented level of 5.4 in April from 49.3 in March, due mainly to a drop in business activity, new business orders and new export business. High frequency indicators of the services sector, in addition to those mentioned above (passenger vehicle sales, domestic passenger air traffic), and including foreign tourist arrival, railway freight traffic, and commercial vehicle sales, contracted in March/April. Fortunately, growth in agriculture has held up, with the total area under summer 45. crops including rice, pulses, coarse cereals and oilseeds up by 43.7 per cent as on May 10, 2020 over the corresponding period of last year. Further, as per the third advance estimates of crop production for 2019-20, production of foodgrains (kharif and rabi) in 2019-20 is 3.7 per cent higher than the final estimates of the previous year. 46. The Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by RBI in May 2020 also paints a grim picture, showing that the overall Current Situation Index is at a historic low, while the Future Expectations Index reflects high pessimism for the year ahead. Thus, consumer sentiment has plunged to abysmally low levels. 47. At the global level, the global manufacturing PMI plunged to an eleven year low in April 2020, while the global services PMI sharply declined to a record low. Accordingly, India\u2019s merchandise exports and imports witnessed record contractions, with exports falling by 60.3 per cent in April 2020, while imports dropped by 58.6 per cent. 48. The economic situation is thus extremely gloomy. While the COVID-19 pandemic is a humanitarian and health crisis, the related lockdown has precipitated a collapse in economic activity, which has come to a near standstill. Other than in the agriculture sector, economic activity may continue to remain sluggish even after the lifting of the lockdown, due to social distancing and shortage of labour as a result of the migration of workers to their native places. In fact, GDP growth in FY:2020-21 is expected to remain in negative territory, with some respite in the second half of the fiscal year. The way forward in terms of restoration of economic activity thus depends on the speed with which the pandemic is contained, how quickly the Indian economy opens up, and how soon supply disruptions are repaired and demand revives. It will also depend on the impact of the combined stimulus from fiscal, monetary, social and administrative measures that have been implemented to create conditions conducive to survival in the crisis, as well as for revival in growth. Over time, some reprioritisation in government expenditure towards health infrastructure and capital expenditure may also be desirable for promoting economic revival. 49. The Government has outlined a comprehensive package in five tranches covering, amongst other measures, rural employment creation, infrastructure creation, focus on MSME sector and creation of an enabling business environment. The package also includes relief measures for poorer sections of society and for resource constrained state governments by increasing their borrowing limits. The measures also encompass a number of major structural reforms, which are more long-term in nature. 50. The Reserve Bank of India has used conventional monetary policy measures as well as unconventional monetary policy tools that supplement the conventional measures in order to ease financial conditions and stimulate growth in the economy. It has also undertaken several measures to improve liquidity, monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy, and provide relief on debt servicing. 51. Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Indian economy, the policy repo rate had already been reduced by 135 basis points between February and October 2019 in response to the slowdown in economic activity. Since the advent of the pandemic, the repo rate was further cut by 75 basis points in the March MPC meeting, amounting to a total cut of 210 basis points between February 2019 and March 2020. The monetary policy transmission to lending rates of banks has improved with a 90 basis points decline in the one-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) between February 2019 and May 15, 2020. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declined by 114 basis points between February 2019 and March 2020 with a fall of 43 basis points in March itself. 52. Given the severity and depth of the crisis, the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated. Thus, in order to revive growth and mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19, it is important to ease financial conditions further. Accordingly, I vote for cutting the policy rate by 40 basis points. This brings the total reduction in the policy rate since the start of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to 115 basis points with the magnitude of cut in the easing cycle that started in February 2019, (up to May 2020) being 250 basis points. In the current scenario, with heightened uncertainty and a near-standstill in economic activity, this may not necessarily lead to an immediate increase in borrowing, but should raise consumer confidence and investor sentiment, going forward. I also vote to maintain the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Statement by Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia 53. Continuing lockdown in the geographical areas that contribute a major share in the Indian economy and worsening global economic situation due to COVID-19 has now created a distinct possibility of the real GDP growth in India during 2020-21 to be in the negative zone for the first time in the last 40 years. Even the nominal GDP growth may slip into the negative zone. There are all symptoms of a recession \u2013 fall in aggregate demand, negative real growth and high unemployment. The government has provided a major fiscal boost through a series of announcements. The role of the monetary policy under such circumstances should be to supplement and support the fiscal efforts to bring the economy out of the unprecedented crisis. Without exhausting all the space for policy rate cuts, in this meeting I, therefore, vote for a 40 bps cut in the policy Repo Rate and maintaining the accommodative stance. More specific reasons for my vote are as follows \u2013 i) Under the lockdown, measurement of consumer inflation and a survey of household inflationary expectations are likely to quite problematic. The samples would be truncated and undesirable biases may enter the estimates making them unreliable and non-representative. Under such circumstances, I feel, the model based forecasts provide a better guide. A very carefully carried out forecasting exercise provides an estimate of headline CPI inflation around 2.8 percent for Q4 2020-21. Even accounting for uncertainties, a very conservative estimate may be taken as 3.1-3.2 percent. Thus, inflation rising above the target of 4 percent does not seem to be any concern for the policy right now. ii) Although the real policy rate in most other comparator countries is zero or negative, in India it is not only positive but relatively very high at around 1.2 to 1.6 percent. I believe that the real policy rate needs to be kept positive but not so high under the present conditions. The fiscal boost given by the Central government in several instalments is likely to result in further slippage of the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio of only 150 bps. Similarly, all states together may raise their fiscal deficit to GDP ratio by about 150 bps. Thus, the impact on the combined fiscal deficit to GDP ratio may be confined to about 300 bps, which in my opinion is quite prudent under such extreme conditions. It may not be inflationary and may result in growth recovery. iv) Once the situation returns back to normal and the fiscal and monetary boost measures start generating impacts, the recovering economy in my opinion may require some further boost. It is prudent to preserve some space for the future. 54. Considering all these factors, I vote for a 40 bps reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance. 55. The impact of COVID-19 on economic activity has turned out to be much more acute than initially expected with the nation-wide lockdown having been extended from initial 3 weeks to 9 weeks. There is still uncertainty as to when the epidemiological curve will flatten and this will continue to cloud the macroeconomic outlook for some more time. Be that as it may, we are staring at a huge negative growth in the current quarter and overall negative growth for the year as a whole. Both demand and supply sides of the economy have collapsed. However, I believe that supplies would recover much faster than demand. This is because capacity to produce goods and services by and large remains intact, though non-availability of labour may temporarily hamper production for a few months. On the other hand, however, there has been a substantial loss of demand. A large number of daily labourers/wage earners have been rendered jobless because of lockdown. Though a part of the unemployed work force will get back to work, still there are some sectors which have been hit hard and many people working in these sectors may have lost their jobs permanently. This will adversely affect private consumption. Otherwise also, consumer confidence has been dented and consumers are likely to cut down on discretionary spending. 56. Within aggregate demand, while private consumption is likely to slowdown from the pre-COVID-19 levels, what worries me more is investment demand, which is likely to be impacted severely for a variety of reasons. First, given the collapse in demand, excess capacity is likely to be created in many sectors. This, combined with huge uncertainty about future demand, both domestic and external, is likely to hamper new investments in the private sector. Second, financing of investment activity \u2013 from own sources due to a decline in profitability or by borrowing due to weak balance sheets \u2013 will also be a challenge. Third, the focus of government spending, both by the Centre and the States, will also be on revenue expenditure than on capital expenditure. For all these reasons, investment activity, which contracted in last two quarters, is expected to be severely hit, going forward. 57. Moving on to inflation, the NSO has released data only on the food and housing groups for April 2020. Food inflation rose to 8.6 per cent in April from 7.8 per cent in March. However, these numbers need to be interpreted with a caution as the rise in food prices in April was caused by a disruption in supply lines and is transitory. The wedge between CPI inflation and WPI inflation for food in April widened sharply by more than 500 bps. While CPI food inflation increased by close to 80 bps in April, WPI inflation declined by 190 bps from 5.5 per cent to 3.6 per cent, suggesting an increase in margins at a retail level due to supply bottlenecks. Should monsoon be normal, as it has been forecast, it should also have a salutary effect on food inflation. I, therefore, feel that risks to food inflation, other than in pulses, are minimal at this stage and overall food inflation is expected to resume its downward trajectory from May/June. Though the print of CPI fuel inflation was not available for April, data from oil 58. market companies suggest that domestic LPG and kerosene plunged in April in line with a decline in global prices. Finally, we also do not have core inflation (excluding food and fuel) print for 59. April. The fall in international crude oil prices has not been passed on to domestic pump prices of petrol and diesel. Though this makes domestic pump prices vulnerable to any rise in international prices, on the current demand supply balance, oil prices are likely to remain soft. Given the collapse in domestic demand, core inflation should soften significantly from the current levels over the medium term. Input cost pressures are also likely to ease due to a sharp decline in global commodity prices. Housing inflation at less than 4 per cent during March-April was the lowest in the series. Gold prices are expected to remain firm due to a flight to safety. On the whole, however, core inflation is expected to remain benign over the next few quarters. Even though there is expected to be a V shaped recovery, the economy will still be left with a considerable slack, which will keep core inflation under check. 60. To sum up, economic activity is expected to contract in 2020-21. While supply lines are likely to be restored as lockdown is relaxed, demand would take far longer to revive to pre-COVID levels. Even as some support will be provided by government expenditure, overall consumption is likely to slow down due to a slump in private consumption. More than private consumption, however, it is investment demand which is expected to be hit hard in this uncertain environment and may be a huge drag on economic activity in the near future with attendant implications for potential growth. Therefore, concerted efforts need to be made to revive investment demand. Overall, inflation over the medium term is expected to be benign. Monetary policy has been eased significantly since February 2019 and the Government has also taken several measures, which will help mitigate deleterious impact of COVID-19 on aggregate demand. However, an unprecedented collapse in demand calls for further easing of financing conditions. With the likely contraction in economic activity and the inflation outlook remaining soft, the policy space has opened up. I, therefore, vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 40 basis points and keeping the stance accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Given the long transmission lags with which monetary policy operates, it is important to create enabling financing conditions so that economic activity takes off swiftly as soon as normalcy is restored. Should the inflation trajectory turn out as expected, some more policy space may open up, going forward. For monetary policy actions to transmit fully to the credit market, it is important that banks remain well capitalised. Only banks with strong balance sheets could be expected to support lending activity as and when credit demand picks up. In my view, the destruction of economic activity by COVID-19 and ensuing 61. lockdowns is much more deleterious in terms of loss of basic livelihood, economic security, health and confidence than the range of estimates/projections of GDP and other macroeconomic aggregates suggest. In India, as in the rest of the world, external trade, investment, manufacturing, services involving people \u2013 hospitality, tourism, aviation and construction \u2013 and investment have been the worst hit. Private consumption is tenuously holding on to positive territory, but spending patterns have altered drastically away from the discretionary and to the essential. The large monetary stimulus and fiscal effort are striving to put a floor under the aggregate demand. At the current juncture, the all-out effort is to maintain and sustain, with the hope that when life is secure, resources, energy and time can be marshalled to rebuild and revive. 62. potential output has been pushed down, and it will take years to repair. In fact, my view is that the damage is so deep and extensive that India\u2019s In the deliberations of the MPC, my view is that the threats to growth have to 64. Meanwhile, the prolonged lockdown has thrown supply into disarray and interrupted the easing of inflation that had gotten underway after the January 2020 peaking. Contemporaneous information suggests that the momentum in the prices of several food items, especially perishables, may be ebbing, with favourable implications for the evolution of headline inflation going forward. This suggests that the food price spike has very little persistence and dispersion (except in April 2020 when the lockdown started producing wider effects), and can be looked through for policy purposes. The sustained loss of momentum of seasonally adjusted GDP growth over eight consecutive quarters is depressing the underlying momentum of core inflation, and this is likely to continue in the near term, as aggregate demand would take time to return to pre-COVID levels. 65. Relative prices tend to adjust within the budget constraint. For setting monetary policy, however, it is the absolute level of prices and its prospective movements that matter. This warrants a careful assessment of aggregate demand. Apart from the unidirectional loss of speed in real GDP growth, monetary conditions are also reflecting the fragile state of demand. While reserve money adjusted for the first round CRR effects is expanding substantially in relation to its pace a year ago, this essentially reflects the large monetary stimulus and the public\u2019s flight to cash \u2013 currency in circulation expanded year-on-year by 18.4 per cent up to May 22, 2020 as against 14.9 per cent a year ago. In the current milieu in which banks are depositing sizeable balances with the Reserve Bank rather than lending/investing, the money multiplier at which this reserve money expansion translates into money supply, has to be adjusted to include LAF reverse repos, which are essentially (remunerated) excess reserves. With this adjustment, the money multiplier would have effectively declined from its normal level of 5.5 to about 4.5. This is showing up in the rate of money supply which has slowed below its secular trend; in fact, the negative money gap (actual rate of money supply minus its trend rate) has widened since 2019-20, especially from the second half. Both bank credit and investments are decelerating to multi-year lows, pointing to badly dented demand and risk aversion. On the other hand, bank deposits are growing faster than a year ago, driven by a precautionary savings instinct in these times of heightened uncertainty. It is important to break this recessionary loop, shore up the erosion in confidence, incentivise banks to invest and lend, and people to spend. It is this context that should condition monetary policy actions and stance. The 66. MPC has decided to remain accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the fallout of COVID-19. In keeping with this stance, the policy rate has been reduced by 75 basis points since February 2020 when the virus outbreak assumed pandemic proportions. In the evolving configuration of growth and inflation, monetary policy can inspire confidence among households and businesses to break the vortex of public preference for deposits over spending and banks\u2019 aversion to lend and invest. Ahead of turning to mend broken areas of activity, it is important to nurture the green shoots that have become visible \u2013 as in agriculture and allied activities \u2013 so that they take root and grow. These considerations warrant backing up past actions and stance with another decisive reduction in the policy rate while persevering with the accommodative stance. The experience of central banks has been that monetary policy acts best when it is reinforced by policy actions and stance in the same direction repetitively till the desired objectives are achieved. The size of the rate reduction needs to be calibrated to the space opened up 67. by the inflation outlook, after allowing for margins of error in these fluid and uncertain times, while keeping in mind the ramifications of the size of the rate reduction for financial stability. 68. Accordingly, I vote for a reduction in the policy rate by 40 basis points while maintaining the accommodative stance of monetary policy that has been reflected in the resolutions of the MPC in the recent period. 69. The impact of COVID-19 on the domestic economy has turned out to be far more severe than initially anticipated. Lockdowns across major economies have also severely impacted economic activity across the globe. In the April WEO, the IMF projected the global economy to contract sharply by 3.0 per cent in 2020. GDP data for Q1:2020 and more recent high frequency indicators emanating from major advanced and emerging market economies, however, suggest that the contraction in global growth could be even deeper. 70. Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by two months of lockdown which was imposed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and save human lives. High frequency indicators for March-April 2020 suggest a collapse of demand. Industrial output, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP) for March, which included only seven days of the nation-wide lockdown, contracted by 16.7 per cent. The contraction was spread across sectors, with manufacturing shrinking by 20.6 per cent and capital goods production by 35.6 per cent. Private consumption, which has been the bedrock of domestic demand, also plummeted with the production of consumer durables falling by 33.1 per cent in March 2020 and that of non-durables by 16.2 per cent. 71. Limited data that are available for April suggest a further shrinkage in demand. India\u2019s merchandise trade slumped in April 2020, with exports contracting by 60.3 per cent and imports by 58.6 per cent. While railway freight traffic shrank by 35.3 per cent in April, steel consumption declined by 90.9 per cent. PMI manufacturing and PMI services in April slipped to unprecedented levels of 27.4 and 5.4 respectively. 72. Bank credit growth continues to be tepid, suggesting weak demand. Non-food credit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) grew by 6.5 per cent (y-o-y) as on May 8, 2020 as compared with 13.0 per cent a year ago. During 2020-21 so far (up to May 8, 2020), however, banks\u2019 investment in commercial paper, shares, bonds and debentures increased by \u20b966,757 crore as against a decline of \u20b98,822 crore during the same period last year, reflecting the impact of targeted long term repo operations (TLTROs) of the Reserve Bank. The only silver lining has been the agriculture sector \u2013 the summer sowing is 73. progressing well. As on May 10, 2020, summer sowing of all crops in the country was much higher by 43.7 per cent (37.9 per cent for rice, 74.8 per cent for pulses and 29.3 per cent for oilseeds) over last year\u2019s acreage. The harvest of rabi crop is almost complete. The forecast of normal monsoon by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) augurs well for agriculture output and farm incomes. 74. On inflation, the headline consumer price index (CPI) for April 2020 was not available on account of nationwide lockdown. Among the major groups, for which indices were released, food group inflation edged up in April 2020 (to 8.6 per cent from 7.8 per cent in the previous month) due to a broad-based increase in inflation across the food sub-groups. 75. The Reserve Bank has been proactively managing liquidity. Since the MPC statement of February 6, 2020 the Reserve Bank has announced liquidity augmenting measures of \u20b99.42 lakh crore (4.6 per cent of GDP). Monetary transmission has continued to improve with the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declining by 43 bps in March; the decrease since February 2019, when the current cycle of rate cut began, being 114 bps. 76. Looking ahead, the growth outlook has deteriorated sharply. There is still uncertainty as to when the COVID curve will flatten. Even as the supply side is expected to ease gradually as the lockdown related restrictions are phased out, it is the demand side, which will continue to weigh heavily on economic activity for some time to come. The impact of the fiscal and contingent liability measures announced by the government on demand creation needs to be carefully watched. Quick implementation of various reform measures can also inject growth impulses into the Indian economy in the medium to long term. Economic activity, however, is expected to contract in the first half of the year before recovering gradually in the second half of 2020-21 on the back of various fiscal, monetary and liquidity measures undertaken in the recent period. Overall, the GDP growth in 2020-21 is estimated to remain in negative territory. The pace of recovery will be contingent upon the containment of the pandemic and how quickly social distancing/lockdown measures are phased out. It has become challenging to assess the inflation outlook in the absence of 77. complete information on CPI. Food inflation is expected to moderate in the coming months as transport impediments and supply lines get eased. This is also corroborated by data on 22 essential commodities released by the Department of Consumer Affairs, which show that prices of several food items have declined in this month so far from the April levels. The meltdown in demand is also likely to result in a significant easing of price pressures in core goods and services. Weak demand conditions in the presence of strong favourable base effects could result in headline inflation falling below the target rate during Q3 and Q4 of 2020-21. 78. Since the last off-cycle MPC meeting on March 27, 2020 macro-financial conditions have deteriorated rapidly. The fast evolving trade-offs between growth and inflation have underscored the need for intensifying the assessment of the macroeconomic outlook, and the preparedness to act pre-emptively to address the swiftly shifting underlying economic and financial conditions and what they portend for the path going forward. Delaying timely monetary policy response by two weeks, waiting for the bi-monthly MPC meeting schedule, could be costly and irreversible. In fact, such a delay in monetary policy action could potentially become a source of risk itself to the deteriorating growth outlook. Monetary policy is a rapid deployment instrument of public policy, and monetary authorities, forewarned by prescient assessment of the prevailing macroeconomic conditions, have to be nimble. It is in this context that the scheduled second bi-monthly meeting of the MPC was advanced from June 3 to 5, 2020 to May 20 to 22, 2020. 79. As pointed out in the foregoing paragraphs, the risks to growth have become far more severe than in our assessment at the end of March 2020. It is expected that this diagnosis will be validated by hard data over the next few months, even as the overall outlook continues to be highly uncertain. The key challenge for monetary policy at this stage is to resuscitate domestic demand to avoid any harmful effect on income and employment in the short run and potential growth over the medium term. For strengthening domestic demand, it is important to revive consumer and business confidence. The Government has already announced a variety of measures to provide economic support to various sectors of the economy and protect the interests of vulnerable sections of society. The Reserve Bank has also been proactively managing liquidity to ensure that funds flow to all productive sectors of the economy. RBI has also been easing monetary policy to reduce the cost of funds/capital to revive domestic demand. While all these measures should help support demand as and when the nation-wide lockdown is lifted, but given the enormity of a collapse in demand, the need is to move ahead full throttle to ease financing conditions further so as to revive consumption and revitalize investment. Since banks are the key players in financing consumption and investment, it is also imperative that they remain adequately capitalised. The benign inflation outlook that is expected for the second half of 2020- 21, coupled with the rising probability of a sharper loss of growth momentum in the near-term, has provided us with more policy space to ease financial conditions further and stimulate growth. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the MPC has voted for front- loading its actions. In view of the deteriorating outlook, it is critical to reinforce these actions in sync with the space provided by the underlying conditions. In assessing the magnitude of policy space, it is important to take into account 80. the weak growth momentum, the need for prioritising growth in view of the less risky inflation outlook, and the need to assure benign financial conditions ahead of the recovery taking hold so that confidence is sustained. Considering all these factors, a reduction in the policy rate by 40 basis points would be appropriate. Accordingly, I vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 40 basis points from 4.4 per cent to 4.0 per cent. I also vote for persevering with the accommodative stance of monetary policy. The RBI remains watchful and shall not hesitate to use any conventional and unconventional tool in its toolkit to revive the macro economy and preserve financial stability while adhering to the inflation target. ", "Aug_2020": "The twenty fourth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from August 4 to 6, 2020. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Professor, Indian Statistical Institute; Dr. Pami Dua, former Director, Delhi School of Economics; Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, former Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua and Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia joined the meeting through video conference. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the in detail staff\u2019s projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (August 6, 2020) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC met in May 2020, global economic activity has remained fragile and in retrenchment in several geographies. While the uneasy and differently-paced withdrawal of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in some countries enabled a sequential improvement in high frequency indicators during May-July, a renewed surge in COVID-19 infections in major economies and threats of a second wave of infections appear to have weakened these early signs of revival. Contractions in economic activity have been more severe in Q2:2020 than in Q1, and the near-term outlook points to a slow, uneven and hesitant recovery pushed into the second half of the year, with risks steeply slanted to the downside. Among advanced economies (AEs), output in the US and the Euro area underwent a deeper contraction in Q2:2020 than in the preceding quarter. Emerging market economies (EMEs) are expected to shrink in Q2 as reflected in high frequency indicators. 7. Global financial markets have rebounded since end-March 2020 with intermittent pauses, shrugging off the volatility and sharp correction recorded in Q1:2020. Portfolio flows returned to EMEs in Q2 after a massive reversal, though there was moderation in July from the previous month\u2019s level. EME currencies have also appreciated in close co-movement, tracking weakening of the US dollar. Crude oil prices have remained supported on supply cuts by oil producing countries (OPEC plus) and improved demand prospects on the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions since May. Gold prices have rallied to an all-time high on August 5 on the back of safe haven demand. In AEs, benign fuel prices and soft aggregate demand have kept inflation subdued. In many EMEs, however, cost-push pressures arising from supply disruptions and demand revival have shown up in consumer prices in June 2020. Global food prices are elevated across the board. Domestic Economy 8. On the domestic front, economic activity had started to recover from the lows of April-May following the uneven re-opening of some parts of the country in June; however, surges of fresh infections have forced re-clamping of lockdowns in several cities and states. Consequently, several high frequency indicators have levelled off. The agricultural sector has emerged as a bright spot. Its prospects have strengthened 9. on the back of good spatial and temporal progress of the south-west monsoon. The cumulative monsoon rainfall was 1 per cent below the long-period average (LPA) up to August 5, 2020. Spurred by the expanding precipitation, the total area sown under kharif crops on July 31 was 5.9 per cent higher than the normal area measured by the average over the period 2014-15 to 2018-19. As on July 30, 2020, the live storage in major reservoirs was 41 per cent of the full reservoir level (FRL), which bodes well for the rabi season. These developments have had a salutary effect on rural demand as reflected in fertiliser production and sales of tractors, motorcycles and fast-moving consumer goods. 10. The pace of contraction of industrial production, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), moderated to (-) 34.7 per cent in May from (-) 57.6 per cent a month ago, with the easing of lockdowns in different parts of the country. All manufacturing sub-sectors, except pharmaceuticals, remained in negative territory. The output of core industries in June contracted for the fourth successive month though with a considerable moderation. The Reserve Bank\u2019s business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2020-21 hit its lowest mark in the survey\u2019s history. The manufacturing PMI remained in contraction, shrinking further to 46.0 in July from 47.2 in the preceding month. High frequency indicators of services sector activity for May-June indicate signs of a 11. modest resumption of economic activity, especially in rural areas, although at levels lower than a year ago. Notably, the decline in passenger vehicle sales moderated to (-) 49.6 per cent in June from (-) 85.3 per cent in May, indicative of tentative urban demand, and faster recovery of sales in rural areas. On the other hand, domestic air passenger traffic and cargo traffic continued to post sharp contraction. Construction activity remained tepid \u2013 cement production fell and finished steel consumption moderated sharply in June. Imports of capital goods \u2013 a key indicator of investment activity \u2013 declined further in June. The services PMI continued in contractionary zone in July to 34.2, although the downturn eased relative to the May and June readings. The National Statistical Office (NSO) released data on headline CPI for the month of 12. June 2020 on July 13, 2020, along with imputed back prints of the index for April and May 2020. This resulted in a sharp upward revision of food inflation for the month of April and May. During Q1:2020-21 food inflation moderated from 10.5 per cent in April to 7.3 per cent in June 2020. Meanwhile, fuel inflation edged up as international kerosene and LPG prices firmed up. Inflation excluding food and fuel was at 5.4 per cent in June, reflecting a spike in prices across most sub-groups. Inflation in transport and communication, personal care and effects, pan-tobacco and education registered significant increases in June. Headline CPI inflation, which was at 5.8 per cent in March 2020 was placed at 6.1 per cent in the provisional estimates for June 2020. 13. For the second successive round, households\u2019 three months ahead expectations remained above their one year ahead expectations, indicating their anticipation of lower inflation over the longer horizon. Producers\u2019 sentiments on input prices remained muted as their salary outgoes fell. Their selling prices contracted in Q1 in the April-June round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey. The contraction in output prices is also corroborated by firms participating in the manufacturing PMI survey. 14. Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially and systemic liquidity remains in large surplus, due to the conventional and unconventional measures by the Reserve Bank since February 2020. Cumulatively, these measures assured liquidity of the order of \u20b99.57 lakh crore or 4.7 per cent of GDP. Reflecting these developments, reserve money (RM) increased by 15.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis (as on July 31, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand (23.1 per cent). Growth in money supply (M3), however, was contained at 12.4 per cent as on July 17, 2020. Average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) moderated from \u20b95.3 lakh crore in May 2020 to \u20b94.1 lakh crore in June as government spending slowed. In July, average daily net absorptions under the LAF moderated further to \u20b94.0 lakh crore, as government spending remained subdued. During 2020-21 (up to July 31), \u20b91,24,154 crore was injected through open market operation (OMO) purchases. In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the term structure and improve transmission, the Reserve Bank conducted \u2018operation twist\u2019 auctions involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for \u20b910,000 crore on July 2, 2020. Furthermore, the utilisation of refinance provided by the Reserve Bank to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and the National Housing Bank (NHB) increased to \u20b934,566 crore on July 31, 2020 from \u20b922,334 crore during the May policy. 15. The transmission to bank lending rates has improved further, with the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declining by 91 bps during March-June 2020. The spreads of 3-year AAA rated corporate bonds over G-Secs of similar maturity declined from 276 bps on March 26, 2020 to 50 bps by end-July 2020. Even for the lowest investment grade bonds (BBB-), spreads have come down by 125 bps by end-July 2020. Lower borrowing costs have led to record primary issuance of corporate bonds of \u20b92.1 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2020-21. the pace of fall moderated on 16. India\u2019s merchandise exports contracted for the fourth successive month in June 2020, improving shipments of agriculture and although pharmaceutical products. Imports fell sharply in June in a broad-based manner, reflecting weak domestic demand and low international crude oil prices. The merchandise trade balance recorded a surplus in June (US$ 0.8 billion), after a gap of over 18 years. The current account balance turned into a marginal surplus of 0.1 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 2019-20 as against a deficit of 0.7 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment moderated to US$ 4.4 billion in April-May 2020 from US$ 7.2 billion a year ago. In 2020-21 (till July 31), net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in equities at US$ 5.3 billion was higher than US$ 1.2 billion a year ago. In the debt segment, however, there were outflows of US$ 4.4 billion during the same period as against inflows of US$ 2.0 billion a year ago. Net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US$ 0.9 billion during the same period. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have increased by US$ 56.8 billion in 2020-21 so far (up to July 31) to US$ 534.6 billion \u2013 equivalent to 13.4 months of imports. Outlook 17. Supply chain disruptions on account of COVID-19 persist, with implications for both food and non-food prices. A more favourable food inflation outlook may emerge as the bumper rabi harvest eases prices of cereals, especially if open market sales and public distribution offtake are expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement. The relatively moderate increases in minimum support prices (MSP) for the kharif crops and monsoon are also supportive of benign inflation prospects. Nonetheless, upside risks to food prices remain. The abatement of price pressure in key vegetables is delayed and remains contingent upon normalisation of supplies. Protein based food items could also emerge as a pressure point, given the tight demand-supply balance in the case of pulses. The inflation outlook of non-food categories is, however, fraught with uncertainty. Higher domestic taxes on petroleum products have resulted in elevated domestic pump prices and will impart broad- based cost-push pressures going forward. Volatility in financial markets and rising asset prices also pose upside risks to the outlook. Taking into consideration all these factors, headline inflation may remain elevated in Q2:2020-21, but may moderate in H2:2020-21 aided by large favourable base effects. Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is expected to be 18. robust, buoyed by the progress in kharif sowing. Manufacturing firms responding to the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2 and to sustain through Q1:2021-22. On the other hand, consumer confidence turned more pessimistic in July relative to the preceding round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey. External demand is expected to remain anaemic under the weight of the global recession and contraction in global trade. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth in Q2-Q4 is expected to evolve along the lines noted in the May resolution. For the year 2020- 21, as a whole, real GDP growth is expected to be negative. An early containment of the COVID-19 pandemic may impart an upside to the outlook. A more protracted spread of the pandemic, deviations from the forecast of a normal monsoon and global financial market volatility are the key downside risks. 19. The June release of headline inflation after a gap of two months and imputed prints of the CPI for April-May have added uncertainty to the inflation outlook. The NSO has adopted best practices in producing these imputations for the purpose of business continuity in the face of challenges to data collection due to the nation-wide lockdown. The NSO has, however, not provided inflation rates for April and May. For the purpose of monetary formulation and conduct, therefore, the MPC is of the view that CPI prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series. 20. The MPC noted that the economy is experiencing unprecedented stress in an austere global environment. Extreme uncertainty characterises the outlook, which is heavily contingent upon the intensity, spread and duration of the pandemic \u2013 particularly the heightened risks associated with a second wave of infections \u2013 and the discovery of the vaccine. In these conditions, supporting the recovery of the economy assumes primacy in the conduct of monetary policy. In pursuit of this objective, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. While space for further monetary policy action in support of this stance is available, it is important to use it judiciously and opportunistically to maximise the beneficial effects for underlying economic activity. 21. At the same time, the MPC is conscious that its primary mandate is to achieve the medium-term target for CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent. It also recognises that the headline CPI prints of April-May, 2020 require more clarity. At the current juncture, the inflation objective itself is further obscured by (a) the spike in food prices because of floods in eastern India and ongoing lockdown related disruptions; and (b) cost- push pressures in the form of high taxes on petroleum products, hikes in telecom charges, rising raw material costs reflected in upward revisions in steel prices and rise in gold prices on safe haven demand. Given the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook and taking into consideration the extremely weak state of the economy in the midst of an unprecedented shock from the ongoing pandemic, it is prudent to pause and remain watchful of incoming data as to how the outlook unravels. 22. Meanwhile, the cumulative reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019 is working its way through the economy, lowering interest rates in money, bond and credit markets, and narrowing down spreads. Financing conditions have eased considerably, enabling financial flows via financial markets, especially at a time when banks remain highly risk averse. Accordingly, the MPC decides to stay on hold with regard to the policy rate and remain watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space to support the revival of the economy. 23. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by August 20, 2020. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent 25. Since the last review, the economy has seen a gradual rebound in economic activity. This is largely mechanical, as much of the lockdown in the economy is being undone as policy constraints on the supply side are removed. 26. Average CPI headline inflation has been above the target range\u2019s upper bound (6 per cent) for the last 6 months (6.7 per cent between January \u2013 March 2020, 6.5 per cent between April-June 2020). While the NSO\u2019s imputed estimates for April-May 2020 inflation require more clarity, it is clear that just looking at CPI headline inflation in March 2020 (5.8 per cent) and June (6.1 per cent) means that the trend is upwards. Inflation excluding food and fuel (i.e., core inflation) also rose to 5.4 per cent in June. Higher price momentum in most sub-groups of core inflation saw some increase in May and June suggesting that core inflation remains high and sticky. 27. On the other hand, after the April peak, food price momentum has subsided, which has largely been driven by the decline in cumulative momentum in vegetables. This however needs to be carefully watched. Both 3-month and 1-year ahead inflationary expectations increased marginally by 10 basis points to 10.4 per cent and 10.5 per cent respectively. The \u201clevelling-off\u201d of inflationary expectations from a steady increase since March 2020 is comforting. 28. The prospect of an \u201cinflation whipsaw\u201d, a phrase used by Markus Brunnermeir at Princeton, is probably the right way to look at inflation going forward, i.e., there are different inflation/deflation pressures that need to be watched carefully. On the upside, a perfect storm of cost push pressures, accommodative monetary policy, and adverse food supply shocks could lead to a pickup in inflation. On the downside, the paradox of thrift, i.e., forced saving pressure induced by a \u201cde-facto\u201d lock-down, could be a potent disinflationary force. In terms of output losses, my assessment is that the worst is almost surely behind us 29. (notwithstanding second waves of the pandemic etc.). 30. damage because of the virus over the next year. Economic crosscurrents however make it difficult to diagnose precisely the underlying 31. now pegged at 3.1 per cent. This is the weakest print in the new data series that started in 2012-2013. The complete year FY20 real GDP growth is 4.2 per cent, which is also the weakest in the series. Netting out government expenditure\u2019s contribution in Q4 FY20, private demand growth remains anaemic. Consumption growth, for instance, in FY 20 was 5.3 per cent compared to 7.2 per cent in FY 18-19 and 8.1 per cent in FY 16-17. In FY 21, these numbers will be compounded by idiosyncratic shocks to particular sectors because of Covid (aviation, tourism) where the policy response has not been adequate. Credit growth continues to remain muted despite large rate cuts. I worry that a 32. negative credit supply shock to the MSME sector may lead to a \u201ccredit-gap\u201d, i.e., a reduction in the supply of credit to small firms, leading to small businesses to shift towards higher cost providers of credit. This will have a bearing on growth. Some of these issues have begun to be addressed in amendments to the recently announced ECLGS scheme by the government. I worry though that if credit continues to be expensive, these firms will become less capital intensive over time, leading to a lower marginal product of labour. The long run equilibrium for the economy will involve a negative impact on wages, and therefore demand. Real GDP growth in Q4 FY 20 based on provisional estimates produced by the NSO is 33. Some high frequency indicators however have begun to turn in June. To name a few, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), PMI services, PMI manufacturing, electricity output, some rural demand indicators like tractor sales, and GST collections have retreated from their earlier lows in April-May. A tentative global recovery is also happening. The distribution of rainfall has overall been positive. Monetary transmission has also improved. This is crucial given the close connection between sovereign yields and funding conditions in the economy. For instance, between March-July 2020, the policy repo rate was cut by 115 bps. The WALR for fresh rupee loans during this period declined by 91 bps. Despite this I worry though that given that there is a lot of uncertainty on the investment side, the option value of waiting will be big, which will delay the onset of investment spending. 34. run. There are other risks due to Covid that pose downside risks to growth in the medium For instance, Covid is simultaneously a negative demand and a negative supply shock. 35. Macro policy broadly must ensure that a temporary Covid type shock to the Indian economy does not become permanent. Economists call this hysteresis. In a post-Covid world, as Olivier Blanchard notes, hysteresis will be driven by human behaviour. Despite the economy opening up, people will still hesitate to go out and spend. This will limit the effects of unlocking the economy. 36. I continue to maintain that the major brunt of future fiscal stimuli should be tilted towards social insurance payments and on the taxation side, where the multipliers are larger. It is important to recognize that fiscal multipliers depend on country characteristics. They are smaller in countries with flexible exchange rate regimes, open to trade, and with high levels of public debt. India has all three. Fiscal multipliers may be larger at the zero lower bound, but India is not there yet. Prices are also more flexible in developing countries like India because of the presence of a large informal sector. This weakens the transmission of fiscal policy from financial markets to the real economy. Fiscal stimulus design will have to keep these factors in mind, and will have a strong bearing on the type of cyclical recovery that the economy experiences. Economic policy is a potent tool for equilibrium selection at the current juncture. This should be a crisis that is not wasted. The government must continue to focus on 37. much needed structural reforms. Some fiscal space should be reserved for later outbreaks. 38. Given the above reasons, it would be opportune to wait and watch to see how the growth-inflation numbers pan out over the next few months. I therefore vote to pause. I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative. 39. I should mention that I have been advocating a more cautious path for policy rate reductions since February 2019. However, I have been in a minority in the MPC. Inflation has now been above the upper band of 6 per cent for a number of months. Notwithstanding large rate cuts to spur growth over the last year and a half, growth has steadily declined despite 250 bps in cuts since February 2019. Future MPCs should not go soft on inflation. Going forward, monetary (and fiscal) policy will be needed to be used wisely with a clear understanding of what and what not they can achieve in terms of controlling inflation, smoothening out the business cycle, and limiting spurious economic volatility. 40. I have been contributing to the setting of monetary policy since February 2013 (first on the TAC, and now on the MPC). I want to thank the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of India for giving me this opportunity. 41. Since the last policy meeting, CPI headline inflation prints have been released for three months \u2013 April, May and June \u2013 of which the numbers for April and May are imputed. The provisional data for June shows headline inflation of 6.1 per cent compared to 5.8 per cent in March. Food inflation moderated somewhat from 7.8 per cent in March to 7.3 per cent in June, while rising in the interim to 10.5 per cent and 8.4 per cent in April and May, respectively. Fuel inflation rose slightly from 1.6 per cent in May to 2.7 per cent in June, reflecting the increase in international LPG and kerosene prices, although it was lower than the March level of 6.6 per cent. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose from 3.9 per cent in March to 5.4 per cent in June, portraying the increase in inflation in transport and communication, personal care and effects, pan-tobacco and education. 42. Going forward, a bumper rabi (winter) crop and a moderate increase in minimum support prices for the kharif crops, along with overall demand compression augur well for inflation. At the same time, however, upside risks to inflation include pressure on vegetable prices, continued supply chain disruptions, high taxes on petroleum products resulting in cost- push pressures, uncertainty regarding price changes in non-food categories, rising asset prices and volatility in financial markets. The headline print is expected to remain elevated in Q2:2020-21 and then moderate in the second half of FY: 2020-21 due to favourable base effects. This conforms with both the May and July 2020 rounds of the Inflation Expectations Survey of Households conducted by the Reserve Bank of India that show higher inflation expectations for the three-months-ahead forecasts compared to forecasts for the one-year- ahead horizon. 43. On the domestic output front, some signs of recovery were visible in June following the partial unlocking of some parts of the country. The ensuing increase in the number of new cases of COVID-19, however, forced the restitution of localised lockdowns, restraining growth in some high frequency indicators. Some indicators of urban consumption demand \u2013 passenger vehicle sales, domestic passenger air traffic and consumer durables \u2013 picked up slightly but continued to remain in deep contraction. On the other hand, some signs of recovery were evident in high frequency indicators of rural demand \u2013 tractor sales, motorcycle sales and production of consumer non-durables. High frequency indicators of investment demand remained weak, including consumption of finished steel, import of capital goods and capital goods production (as per the use-based classification of IIP), although the year-on-year contraction in cement production eased considerably in June. Contraction in IIP, year-on-year, moderated to (-) 34.7 per cent in May 2020 from (-) 57.6 per cent in the previous month due to the easing of lockdowns. Within manufacturing, only pharmaceuticals witnessed positive growth. 44. The Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing continued in the contraction zone, dropping to 46.0 in July from 47.2 in the preceding month. The PMI for services also continued in the contractionary zone while edging up to 34.2 in July, although contracting much less than in April and May. High frequency indicators of the services sector under construction and trade, hotels and transport \u2013 steel consumption, cement production, passenger vehicle sales, domestic passenger air traffic, railway freight traffic and commercial vehicle sales \u2013 contracted in June. Within financial and professional services, non-food credit growth remained muted. 45. Fortunately, growth in agriculture has held up, with the total area under summer crops (kharif) including rice, pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds, cotton and sugarcane, up by 13.9 per cent as on July 31, 2020 over the corresponding period of last year and by 5.9 per cent over the normal area (5 years average). The Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by RBI in July 2020 shows that the 46. overall Current Situation Index is at a historic low, while the Future Expectations Index reflects some optimism for the year ahead. On the external front, the pace of contraction of India\u2019s exports growth slowed down 47. in June to (-) 12.4 per cent from (-) 43 per cent during March to May. Imports growth, however, dropped by (-) 47.6 per cent in June. 48. increased to 50.3 and 50.5, respectively, in July, and moved back to the expansion zone. 49. The prognosis for the economic situation is thus highly uncertain. There are some signs of revival, but the restoration of economic activity depends on how soon supply disruptions are repaired and demand revives. This depends, amongst other factors, on the severity of the evolving pandemic in terms of its depth, duration and diffusion and the control of infections, as well as the development of a vaccine. 50. Clearly, it is important to revive the economy and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with the objective of monetary policy \u2013 to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. It is thus prudent to continue with the accommodative stance of monetary policy. At the same time, the mandate of the MPC is to achieve the target of CPI inflation (combined) of 4 per cent with the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent and the lower tolerance bound of 2 per cent. 51. In its attempts to revive the economy, the MPC has already front loaded cuts in the policy rate. In fact, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the Indian economy, the policy repo rate was reduced by 135 basis points between February and October 2019 in response to the slowdown in economic activity. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the repo rate was further cut by 75 basis points in the March MPC meeting and 40 basis points in the May meeting, amounting to a total cut of 250 basis points between February 2019 and May 2020 and 115 basis points between March and May 2020. The monetary policy transmission to lending rates of banks has also improved, with a 91 basis points decline in the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans between March and June 2020. However, at the present juncture, the outlook for inflation is also uncertain, with risks more on the upside. Some clarity is also required with respect to the imputation of the April and May prints. In this context, CPI inflation data for at least two or three more months will be crucial for clearly gauging the impact of supply side disruptions and demand conditions on prices. Considering the above factors, at this juncture, it is best to adopt a wait and watch 52. strategy and look forward to incoming data to assess the evolving macroeconomic situation. I therefore vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target, going forward. 53. After the last MPC meeting in May 2020, changes in the economic environment were along the expected lines except the official announcement about the headline CPI and implicit inflation numbers during April, May and June. These high inflation prints coupled with the apprehensions about GDP growth likely to be negative both in real terms and nominal terms would imply that the economy is not caught up in recession with deflation but in a deep stagflation, which occurs when the adverse supply shock is more severe than the demand shock. Under such circumstances, expansionary aggregate demand policies \u2013 both monetary and fiscal \u2013 would result first in fueling inflation further rather than output and employment expansion and growth recovery, which is expected under recession with deflation. I have strong reservations in accepting the implicit inflation numbers for April and May announced by the NSO. I would, therefore, like to wait and watch for more reliable and realistic estimates of the headline inflation before taking any decision on the policy rate. I vote for status quo both on the policy repo rate and the stance. More specific reasons for my vote are as follows \u2013 Price quotations collected for various items from the designated shops by NSO to measure inflation could not be collected during April and May because of the nation- wide lockdown. Even for June, the sample was not satisfactory to prepare the estimates for different states. Instead of leaving the gap in the CPI series, the NSO decided to impute the CPI values for April and May as suggested by the business continuity guidelines issued by a group of six international agencies that resulted in the implicit headline inflation of 7.2 percent for April and 6.3 percent for May from 5.8 percent for March. On the other hand, inflation based on the CPI for Industrial Workers released by the Labour Bureau (that has a very high degree of correlation with CPI-C prepared by NSO) for the months of March, April and May are respectively 5.50, 5.45 and 5.10 percent. Similarly, WPI \u2013 the index used to measure inflation in India till 2014 \u2013 based inflation rates for March, April and May are respectively 0.42, (-)1.57 and (-)3.21 percent. Thus, the imputed CPI and inflation rates implied by them do not seem to be consistent with the alternative measures not only in terms of the magnitude but also in the direction of change. ii) Moreover, I have been expressing serious concerns over the mismeasurement of inflation in our country (see The Report of the Sixth Central Pay Commission, 2008; and my article in Economic and Political Weekly, Nov.17, 2018) by the fixed base- weighted index with limited number of consumption items instead of the chain-base weighted index method followed in the developed countries. In an extreme situation created by the nation-wide lockdown for months, the consumption pattern in the country has significantly and substantially changed. This would simply not be reflected in the measurement of our headline inflation based on the fixed base-weighted index even if all price quotations were available; and would provide an unrealistic measurement of inflation. Imputation of the headline inflation numbers ignoring all such limitations when used in forecasting models and policy simulation exercises may misrepresent and provide misleading signals. It is, therefore, prudent to ignore them and wait for more reliable measurements and estimates. The household survey rounds for inflationary expectations carried out in May and July 2020 provide very interesting results. When the standard errors are considered, there was no statistically significant difference between May and July rounds of the survey in the three months ahead and one year ahead inflationary expectation of households. Similarly, in the July round of the survey, there is no statistically significant difference between the current perception of inflation and one year ahead inflationary expectations of the households, though the difference between three months ahead inflationary expectations and the current perception of inflation is statistically significant. This suggests that the (urban) households expect faster recovery of aggregate demand over the aggregate supply in the short run, but expect the supply to recover faster in the long run reducing the inflationary pressures. v) On the other hand, the RBI\u2019s industrial outlook survey shows that manufacturing firms expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2:2020-21 and sustain through Q1:2021-22. Producers expected their input prices and costs to remain low and their selling prices actually contracted during April-June 2020. Similarly, the consumer confidence survey conducted by RBI also does not paint any optimistic picture. Thus, there are high uncertainties and some contradictory evidences about the 54. characterization of the current and future macroeconomic environment. I am sceptical about the deep stagflationary conditions prevailing in the country. Although the present circumstances are truly exceptional, the primary mandate given to MPC for inflation targeting at 4 percent with the upper tolerance limit of 6 percent has to be respected. In fact, the confusion and uncertainty created by the imputed CPI-C and implied inflation estimates needs to be cleared by more of regular readings on inflation rates. Since the transmission of the policy rate cuts to the money, bond and credit markets has been commendable but not complete, there is no harm in taking a pause at this juncture. In my view, the available space for policy rate should now be used prudently and opportunistically to optimize the impact on the economic recovery. Hence, I vote for a status quo on the policy stance and rate. For purposes of transparent communication, it will be useful to explicitly recognise 55. that monetary policy is being framed under considerable uncertainty at the current juncture. The depth of the gorge created by the unprecedentedly deep pandemic shock is difficult to measure. The underlying data is populated from incomplete and less reliable information due to missing data, larger sampling and non-sampling errors. Unusual revisions are likely down the line. Forecast uncertainty is compounded by the future course the pandemic might take. With medical solutions yet to be found, it is difficult to anticipate the output loss that might occur from further waves of infections even as path to normalisation has begun. 56. Growth estimates for 2020-21 are difficult to arrive at the current juncture, but there could be a downward bias to the present consensus estimates when the final data becomes available. Inflation, on the other hand, may have an upward bias. The recovery path is inextricably linked to the course the pandemic might take and complete normalisation will be difficult till pandemic is overcome. High frequency indicators of real activity show that contractions have turned smaller in May and still smaller in June as activity recovers from the severe lockdown in April. Recovery in GST, including through E-way bills, railway freight, port cargo, cement production and petroleum consumption has been particularly encouraging. However, with the notable exceptions of electricity and tractors, all other indicators remained in red in June with levels at least 15 per cent below that in February. Vehicle registrations, railway and airline passenger traffic remain abysmally low in face of travel restrictions. Anecdotal evidence from industry sources suggest that activity levels might improve only marginally in July. This signals that it may be hard to recover the last 10 per cent of the production given that the Covid-19 curve has not flattened yet. The disruption caused by it will leave hysteresis, implying some permanent damage to potential output even after pandemic recedes, although speedy policy action has contained this impairment. In these circumstances, the MPC has been rightfully mindful of growth as well within the flexible inflation targeting framework. It has taken actions with a view to prevent output collapse that could otherwise have had lasting impact. 57. Inflation statistics in the pandemic period have elements of fuzziness. Statistical authorities had to resort to imputation method in face of lockdown and had not released the headline inflation for the month of April and May. Item-level data is also not available for March-June. However, the June data shows that inflation is above the upper tolerance level when the markets coverage in price statistics had improved to 88 per cent of the usual coverage, up from 52 per cent in April. Quotations coverage could be relatively lower. It is not clear if the full coverage would have made a difference to the headline number. However, the best judgment that I can exercise with available information is that non-monetary factors may have led the headline inflation persisting above the acceptable band for most of the months since December, but monetary factors may also be contributing to the elevated inflation. Ex-food and fuel, inflation was at 5.4 per cent in June. However, this core component itself has been driven high by certain elements that may not be contributing to true inflation. For instance, gold that enters into personal care and effects segment may have contributed about 34 bps to the headline inflation if one were to proximate it by gold prices in the market. Ex-food, fuel and estimated gold, inflation was likely in the vicinity of 5.1 per cent. Consumption of gold had dropped but the CPI index is driven by Laspeyres or base-year consumption weights and not Paasche or current consumption weights. The bias on this count, however, could be non-material as high food inflation may have been accompanied by higher current consumption of food in the overall basket. 58. The question relevant for the policy is how long food inflation might stay high and are we seeing signs of generalisation. Food inflation should soften as food stock levels are well above norms, monsoon is shaping normal, reservoir levels are reasonable and kharif sowing has been brisk. However, the drivers of food inflation include protein-rich food sub-groups and as is evident from retail price data from the Department of Consumer Affairs, also tomatoes and potato. Price rise in protein-rich items has significant demand component. Moreover, rise in food prices, even though predominantly caused by supply disruption, runs the risks of generalisation to keep headline inflation higher than is being anticipated. The incipient signs of generalisation have also been aided by higher excise and VAT on petro- products. Higher diesel prices have implications for transportation costs. Risks to inflation arise from price stickiness and supply chain disruptions, high costs of rebuilding or modifying supply chains and less than competitive markets under lockdowns, translating into higher retail margins. As such, it remains to be seen how much inflation falls later in the year due to demand destruction, base effects and improved agriculture supplies. In my view, with considerable policy rate reduction effected since February 2019 and 59. liquidity and credit easing getting frontloaded since March 2020, a breather is necessary awaiting greater clarity. The transmission of rate cuts has picked up in the preceding quarter. Liquidity infusions have reduced financial market spreads on corporate paper of various tenors and credit quality, especially of corporate bonds whose issuance has risen. During July, the All-India financial institutions and Housing Finance Companies have been able to raise money through Commercial Papers at a weighted average rate below the reverse repo rate and corporates and NBFCs at below repo rate. Further rate reductions may come in the way of smoothening of interest rate movements unless durable reduction in path of inflation materialises. While markets and fundamentals seldom do a tango, a disconnect between the two carry the risks of disruptive market corrections. Policy needs to be mindful of the space that may be needed to deal with possibility of increased stress that may resurface later with loan defaults and recognition of bad loans. Impact of fiscal actions and space also need to be closely observed for demand management. Growth is at risk over the medium term if we sacrifice macro-financial stability for short-run expediency. Moreover, there is sound rationale that monetary policymakers should do less under uncertainty. While pausing, it is best to retain the accommodative stance as long as the baseline suggests that inflation will soften to well within the tolerance band keeping in view the need to avoid frequent directional changes even as policy remains data dependent. Also, confidence levels are currently fragile and monetary transmission of earlier rate reduction is still in pipeline. 60. Considering all of above, I vote for leaving the policy rate unchanged and maintaining accommodative stance as communicated in the resolution, that emphasises need for continued support to growth, while remaining watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space so as to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward. 61. From the time of the outbreak of the pandemic, the setting of monetary policy by the monetary policy committee (MPC) has involved the assignment of a more than proportionate weight to growth relative to inflation. The severe contractions in various sectors of the economy in the first half of 2020-21 so far vindicate this weighting scheme. Disappointingly, however, inflation surprises of recent months are undermining the 62. MPC\u2019s actions and stymieing its resolve to do what it takes to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. The unanticipated concoction of imputations of the consumer price index (CPI) for April and May 2020, supply disruptions and unrelenting cost push interventions in price formation that have reared up outside the ambit of monetary policy has complicated its conduct, especially as the inflation levitation seems to show persistence. 63. Amidst the high uncertainty characterising the near-term outlook, two outcomes are possible, drawing from precedents alone. There can be a good outcome based on the 2016-17 experience when a combination of delayed market arrivals and risk-minimising supply management caused food inflation \u2013 which had risen to 8.0 per cent in July of that year \u2013 to fall off a cliff in the next month (August) itself. For the year as a whole, headline inflation averaged 4.5 per cent in spite of some hysteresis in core inflation. There can also be a bad outcome as in 2009-10 when, awash with stimulus, a build-up of domestic inflationary pressures and inflation expectations occurred on the back of surging food prices in the backdrop of a failed monsoon, and it spilled over into other components. Monetary policy action was delayed on the ground of nurturing nascent growth impulses; inflation became generalised and 13 consecutive policy rate increases could not excoriate inflation\u2019s pernicious hold. The 2009 experience has striking similarities with what confronts us today. There is one important difference though \u2013 in 2009-10, India rebounded out of the global financial crisis and its real GDP growth was strong at close to 8 per cent. In 2020-21, India\u2019s real GDP is widely expected to record its deepest contraction in history. There is also an important lesson from the 2009-10 experience \u2013 in India, food prices are the \u2018true core\u2019 of inflation dynamics. They can and do get persistent and generalised into wider macroeconomic instability. 64. At the current juncture, with inflation prints above the upper tolerance band, technical considerations under the monetary policy framework warrant a pre-occupation with dealing with the conditions of failure. All this, after a period of four years of uninterrupted success in keeping inflation well within the tolerance band and in fact, closely aligned with the target, which has earned the country credibility in monetary policy conduct, investor confidence and the anchoring of expectations! Consequently, monetary policy is forced into a standstill even when there is space available to persevere with its commitment to reinvigorate growth momentum and alleviate the effects of COVID-19. In fact, if inflation persists above the upper tolerance band for one more quarter, monetary policy will be constrained by mandate to undertake remedial action, including an immediate and more than proportionate response to head off the build-up of inflation pressures and prevent it from getting generalised. The question is: can the economy withstand it in this virus-ravaged, debilitated state? The MPC has already signalled its concern in its stance by resolving to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward. It has also expressed the unanimous view that for the purpose of monetary formulation and conduct, CPI prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series. The outlook is grim; even when it improves, the expectation is one of slow, hesitant 65. recovery, with the situation likely to worsen before it gets better. The upticks that easing of lockdowns yield are likely to be ephemeral and vulnerable to flattening out due to lack of underlying vigour. A durable revival of the economy depends on sustained policy support to resuscitate activity in various sectors, restore employment and livelihood to the displaced and dispossessed, continue to assure health support and pursuit of the vaccine, ease financial stresses facing households, businesses and financial intermediaries, instil confidence and anchor financial stability before it slips away. This underscores the urgency of unshackling monetary policy from extraneous non-pandemic constraints, emerging out of inadequate and lagged reactions in terms of supply management. In the absence of this coordinated strategy, monetary policy will be left with no option but to adhere to its primary mandate of the MPC, which is after all, achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. 66. At this juncture, therefore, I vote for status quo on the policy rate. I reiterate that, abstracting from the exogenous shocks to inflation mentioned earlier, the state of the economy warrants that the MPC should continue to maintain its accommodative stance, while ensuring that inflation returns to the target. 67. The outlook for the domestic economy remains extremely uncertain as the impact of COVID-19 is more severe than initial assessments and the global economy remains vulnerable to renewed surge in community infections and fears of a second wave. While the US and the Euro area registered record-setting contraction in output in Q2:2020, the emerging market economies (EMEs) also look set to see large declines in output. Even as high frequency indicators suggest some momentum in July, the near-term outlook remains uninspiring with large downside risks. In this backdrop, relatively buoyant global financial markets demonstrate not just a disconnect with underlying economic fundamentals, but also portend financial stability risks, particularly for EMEs. 68. Recent data releases on sale of automobiles (wholesale), electricity generation and issuance of e-way bills indicated that a moderate recovery was taking place in the domestic economy. Indicators relating to investment like cement and steel production saw some moderation in the pace of contraction to 6.9 percent and 33.8 percent, respectively, in June as compared to the previous two months (cement contracted by 21.4 per cent in May and 85.3 per cent in April, while steel contracted by 43.1 per cent in May and 78.7 per cent in April). Lately, however, it is seen that the nascent signs of recovery in June following the gradual resumption of activity in the country, have again slumped after a renewed spate of infections forced re-imposition of lockdowns in several states and cities. The agriculture sector remains a beacon of hope. The progress of the south-west monsoon in terms of wider coverage and intensity along with the significant increase in the total area sown under kharif crops augur well for the rural economy as reflected in fertiliser production and sales of tractors, motorcycles and fast-moving consumer goods. Robust agricultural production would not only have a salutary impact on rural demand but also should help easing of the inflationary pressure from food prices, going ahead. 69. The July 13, 2020 NSO press release on CPI, which published the imputed headline CPI index for April and May along with the provisional headline inflation number for June, brought about a significant change in assessment of the inflation trajectory for Q1:2020-21 and added uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Though the NSO has adopted best practices in imputing CPI for the months of April and May, the CPI prints for April and May obscure a realistic assessment of the inflationary momentum and can be regarded as a break in the CPI series for monetary policy formulation. 70. Imputed food inflation for April-May 2020 showed a sharp upward revision compared to earlier releases. The June 2020 CPI showed food inflation remaining at an elevated level. While vegetables inflation moderated, inflationary pressures in protein-based food items and cereals got entrenched. Further, price inflation in spices and oils and fats which was already elevated pre-lockdown, remained in double digits. Moreover, imputed CPI excluding food and fuel inflation during April-May surged by 90-100 bps from March readings. They were seen to accentuate further in June due to inflationary pressures in pan, tobacco and intoxicants, transportation and communication and personal care and effects sub-groups, among others. Consequently, headline inflation remained above 6 per cent in June. Inflation expectation of households, as polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s July 2020 round of survey, rose marginally by 10 bps for 3-month and 1-year ahead horizons. One year ahead expectations were, however, lower than the 3-month ahead expectations, suggesting lower inflation expectations over the longer horizon. 71. In the recent months, the major drivers of inflation have been supply-chain disruptions resulting from localised lockdown; increase in excise duty and VAT on petroleum products; price pressures in protein rich items and vegetables; and impact of statistical imputations. Looking ahead, headline inflation is expected to remain elevated in Q2:2020-21 due to inflationary pressures in both food as well as core inflation. Near-term price pressures in CPI excluding food and fuel continue due to cost-push factors and lock-down related production and supply-chain disruptions, even as aggregate demand conditions register sharp contraction in the post COVID-19 scenario. 72. The generalised inflationary pressures across food and CPI excluding food and fuel, in a situation where growth is expected to contract sharply, is a matter of serious concern. The survey-based measures of slack in the economy testify that there is little risk to inflation from demand side. Given that supply disruptions and bottlenecks in the post-COVID environment are key factors in engendering these inflationary impulses, the containment of it calls for proactive sector-specific supply-side measures. In case of edible oils this would entail augmenting imports to meet domestic shortfall and rationalisation of import duties. For pulses also, imports may have to be continued to the extent of domestic supply shortfall. Further, if open market sales and public distribution offtake of cereals are expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement, it would help in easing of cereal price pressures during the latter part of the year. As the economy recovers, some rebalancing of the duty structure on petroleum products can ease some of the cost-push pressures on the economy. Such timely policy intervention to ameliorate supply side concerns along with prospects of a normal monsoon and large favourable base effects could result in moderation in inflation during H2:2020-21. Regarding growth outlook, the rural economy is expected to be robust while industrial 73. and services activity may recover gradually. The recovery out of current slowdown, which is mainly conditioned by supply disruptions and compression of consumption demand especially on non-essential goods and services, would depend on the containment of Covid pandemic and unlocking of economic activities. Rural indicators led by good monsoon, higher kharif sowing and Government-led initiatives to provide employment in the rural areas have shown sharp revival which, if sustained, can provide support to demand going forward. High frequency indicators, however, suggest that private consumption which is the mainstay of aggregate demand remains subdued. Certain crucial sectors such as tourism, hospitality and entertainment will take some time to recover. Consumer confidence, as captured from the Reserve Bank\u2019s July 2020 survey, is low; however, one year ahead expectations have improved and indicate some optimism. External demand is expected to remain frail. Manufacturing firms responding to the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, however, expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2:2020-21 and to sustain through Q1:2021-22. Low capacity utilisation amid subdued domestic and external demand is likely to delay early revival of investment demand. In view of the above, real GDP is likely to shrink in the first half of the year, and growth for the full year 2020-21 is estimated to be negative. In an environment of extreme stress and uncertain outlook, the Reserve Bank\u2019s 74. proactive management of liquidity through both conventional and unconventional measures undertaken since February 2020 have cumulatively infused liquidity to the extent of \u20b99.57 lakh crore (4.7 per cent of GDP) and have alleviated stress on the domestic financial conditions. Comfortable liquidity conditions, in turn, have helped improve monetary transmission in consonance with the MPC's accommodative stance and actions and borrowing costs in financial markets have plummeted to their lowest levels in a decade. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 162 basis points during February 2019-June 2020, of which 91 basis points transmission was witnessed during March-June 2020. As I have been reiterating since October 2019, monetary policy is geared towards 75. supporting the economic recovery process. Although there is headroom for further monetary policy action, at this juncture it is important to keep our arsenal dry and use it judiciously. I also feel that we should wait for some more time for the cumulative 250 basis points reduction in policy rate since February 2019 to seep into the financial system and further reduce interest rates and spreads. Given the uncertain inflation outlook, we have to remain watchful to see that the momentum in inflation does not get entrenched, which is also dependent on effective supply-side measures. As the economy continues to be in a fragile state, recovery in growth assumes primacy. It would be prudent at this stage to wait for a firmer assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation as the staggered opening of the economy progresses, supply bottlenecks ease and the price reporting pattern stabilises. Considering all these aspects, I vote for a pause on the policy rate at this moment while continuing with the accommodative stance. ", "Oct_2020": "The twenty fifth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from October 7 to 9, 2020. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Professor, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB (2) (c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma joined the meeting through video conference. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and (c) the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under sub- section (11) of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge 4. inflation expectations, corporate sector consumer confidence, households\u2019 performance, credit conditions, industrial, services and the outlook infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (October 9, 2020) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium- term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Incoming data point to a recovery in global economic activity in Q3 of 2020 in sequential terms, although downside risks have risen with the renewed surge in infections in many countries. Global trade is expected to be subdued. The rebound could turn out to be stronger among advanced economies (AEs) than in emerging market economies (EMEs). Global financial markets remain supported by highly accommodative monetary and liquidity conditions. Soft fuel prices and weak aggregate demand have kept inflation below target in AEs, although in some EMEs, supply disruptions have imparted upward price pressures. Domestic Economy 7. On the domestic front, high frequency indicators suggest that economic activity is stabilising in Q2:2020-21 after the 23.9 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in real GDP in Q1 (April-June). Cushioned by government spending and rural demand, manufacturing \u2013 especially consumer non-durables \u2013 and some categories of services, such as passenger vehicles and railway freight, have gradually recovered in Q2. The outlook for agriculture is robust. With merchandise exports slowly catching up to pre-COVID levels and some moderation in the pace of contraction of imports, the trade deficit widened marginally sequentially in Q2. 8. Headline CPI inflation increased to 6.7 per cent during July-August 2020 as pressures accentuated across food, fuel and core constituents on account of supply disruptions, higher margins and taxes. One year ahead inflation expectations of households suggest some softening in inflation from three months ahead levels. Selling prices of firms remain muted, reflecting the weak demand conditions. Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially, with systemic liquidity 9. remaining in large surplus. Reserve money increased by 13.5 per cent on a year-on- year basis (as on October 2, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand (21.5 per cent). Growth in money supply (M3), however, was contained at 12.2 per cent as on September 25, 2020. Banks\u2019 non-food credit growth remains subdued. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 545.6 billion on October 2, 2020. 10. Turning to the outlook for inflation, kharif sowing portends well for food prices. Pressures on prices of key vegetables like tomatoes, onions and potatoes should also ebb by Q3 with kharif arrivals. On the other hand, prices of pulses and oilseeds are likely to remain firm due to elevated import duties. International crude oil prices have traded with a softening bias in September on a weak demand outlook, but domestic pump prices may remain elevated in the absence of any roll back of taxes. Pricing power of face of subdued demand. labour shortages and high COVID-19-related supply disruptions, transportation costs, could continue to impose cost-push pressures, but these risks are getting mitigated by progressive easing of lockdowns and removal of restrictions on inter-state movements. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 6.8 per cent for Q2:2020-21, at 5.4-4.5 per cent for H2:2020-21 and 4.3 per cent for Q1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is expected to 11. strengthen further, while the turnaround in urban demand is likely to be lagged in view of social distancing norms and the elevated number of COVID-19 infections. While the contact-intensive services sector will take time to regain pre-COVID levels, manufacturing firms expect capacity utilisation to recover in Q3:2020-21 and activity to gain some traction from Q4 onwards. Both private investment and exports are likely to be subdued, especially as external demand is still anaemic. Taking into consideration the above factors and the uncertain COVID-19 trajectory, real GDP growth in 2020-21 is expected to be negative at (-)9.5 per cent, with risks tilted to the downside: (-)9.8 per cent in Q2:2020-21; (-)5.6 per cent in Q3; and 0.5 per cent in Q4. Real GDP growth for Q1:2021-22 is placed at 20.6 per cent (Chart 2). 12. The MPC is of the view that revival of the economy from an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic assumes the highest priority in the conduct of monetary policy. While inflation has been above the tolerance band for several months, the MPC judges that the underlying factors are essentially supply shocks which should dissipate over the ensuing months as the economy unlocks, supply chains are restored, and activity normalises. Accordingly, they can be looked through at this juncture while setting the stance of monetary policy. Taking into account all these factors, the MPC decides to maintain status quo on the policy rate in this meeting and await the easing of inflationary pressures to use the space available for supporting growth further. 13. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to continue with this accommodative stance at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year, with Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voting against this formulation. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by October 23, 2020. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent 15. Two key goals from the monetary policy perspective at the present juncture, in which output growth has declined sharply and inflation pressures remain, are enabling sustained recovery of the economy and moderation in inflation rate. The policy rates were left unchanged in the meeting of the MPC held on 16. August 4-6, 2020 after a cumulative reduction of 115 basis points in rates between January and May 2020 in view of the prevailing modest GDP growth rate. The MPC policy statement of August 2020 reflected the concerns on the economic outlook as the COVID-19 pandemic began to take its toll. 17. The contraction in GDP in Q1: 2020-21, year-on-year basis, by 23.9 per cent, is a severe shock to the economy affecting employment and income. The decline in economic output is reflected in both production and expenditure accounts across most components. The Gross Value Added declined in all the non-farm sectors and in the case of demand, contraction in Private Final Consumption Expenditure and Gross Fixed Capital Formation was sharp. The only major component of demand that showed growth was Government Final Consumption Expenditure. Both exports and imports of goods and services declined, with imports declining more than the decline in exports. In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, the extensive restrictions on the movement of goods and services barring the essential needs, imposed from the last week of March-May saw gradual relaxation from June onwards but a full economic recovery will require adjustments in the production and supply processes to control the spread of the disease. The recovery process will also be affected by the dynamic of the pandemic across the country as regional variations would also affect supply chains. The present status of the impact of the pandemic suggests that there has 18. been reduction in the daily new cases and mortalities due to COVID-19 towards the end of September but these numbers are large and the potential for an increase cannot be ignored. This would mean that relaxation of movement restrictions would help restore production, but the process would be gradual and subject to the measures that would be taken by the producers, providers of services and the consumers to control the spread of the virus. 19. Restoration of the supply side of the economy in a manner that is safe for the workers and the consumers is necessary for sustained economic recovery. There will be a need for changes in transportation and work places to mitigate the risks associated with the transmission of Covid 19. 20. The relative immunity of agriculture from the supply shocks may have been partly a result of the fact that the virus spread initially in urban areas and there were immediate efforts to limit the spread. The supply chains for the key food commodities were also exempted from transport restrictions, leading to sustenance of supply of these commodities. 21. There are indeed constraints that need to be addressed to restore the health of the firms that have lost revenues and returns. Access to credit to revive and expand production and markets is one of the essential factors in this regard. Bank lending rates to the productive sectors including housing have declined and a robust revival, however, would depend on the revival of demand. The weak demand conditions are also reflected in the decline in non-food bank credit upto September in 2020-21 over the previous year. Revival of consumer demand would require restoration of confidence in the safety in participation in normal economic activities and availability of health care. Public investment in improving infrastructure to achieve these goals would help build consumer confidence. 22. The current account balance, foreign capital flows and forex reserves position indicate relative stability in the external sector under a low demand equilibrium in both domestic and global markets. The depressed investment demand conditions are also reflected in the dampened state of demand for capital and weak growth in bank credit to non-food sector. The fiscal position of the governments - both Centre and the States - is under 23. pressure as the tax revenues have declined. The governments will be required to maintain their spending levels to meet the extraordinary demands to support livelihoods and lives in the present conditions. 24. Continued weakness in demand conditions would put greater stress on fiscal position and also the financial system. The broad indicators of economic activity in the recent months suggest a 25. revival from the sharp decline in Q1. Some of this improvement is on account of relaxation of movement restrictions, opportunities in sectors such as the pharma industry, and the requirement of critical inputs such as fertilisers. The more general pickup in activities is reflected in the expectation of improvement in capacity utilisation and perceptions of improved demand conditions in the recent surveys of enterprises reported by RBI. 26. The GDP will see sustained revival beginning from the second quarter of the year, with the rate of contraction from the levels of previous year declining steadily. As indicated in the MPC Resolution, the GDP growth is expected to be positive in Q4: 2020-21, although for the year as a whole, the growth rate is projected to be -9.5 per cent over the previous year. The Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by RBI in September 2020 yields a median forecast of -9.1 per cent for the year 2020-21 and an assessment by NCAER\u2019s Quarterly Review of the Economy places the GDP growth for 2020-21 at -12.6 per cent. Going forward into Q2 to Q4: 2020-21 these projections imply recovery in the economic activities from the large initial negative shock in Q1. 27. On the price front, the CPI inflation has stayed above 6.5%, Y-o-Y basis during July-August 2020. This is above the tolerance band of the inflation target set for the monetary policy. The food inflation averaged 8.4% during the same period and CPI based inflation rate for items excluding food and fuel was 5.6%. The food inflation will remain a concern as it is often driven by the perishable produce like vegetables, which cannot be controlled in the short term except by removing bottlenecks in the supply chain upto the retail level or additional fresh supplies. As noted in MPC Resolution, inflation is expected to moderate in Q3 and Q4: 2020-21. Two of the main drivers of price inflation on the supply side now are food and fuel. In the case of food, the favourable monsoon rains support the prospects of good harvest and its moderating impact on food inflation. The global conditions for crude petroleum prices appear stable from here onwards till the end of 2020-21. There are clearly uncertainties facing the growth and inflation projections. 28. There is also uncertainty over the speed with which the Covid-19 pandemic is brought under control, which also affects growth and inflation scenarios in the next 2-3 quarters. Towards the end of Q2, there are indications of revival of the economy after the relaxation of restrictions on transportation and businesses across the country. As supply chains adapt to the new conditions, recovery is expected to be stronger and sustained. To achieve this outcome, an accommodative monetary policy is needed at this juncture. Moderation in upward cost pressures on prices and decline in food inflation rates would require a quick output recovery from the supply side measures. The outlook for growth and inflation for the next 3-4 quarters suggests the 29. need for a policy environment enabling recovery of output. The inflationary pressures are a concern but present assessment reflects moderating inflationary pressures in the remaining quarters of the year. 30. Therefore, I vote for retaining the current policy rates and continuation of accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. I also vote to continue with this accommodative stance at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year. Statement by Dr. Ashima Goyal 31. The MPC\u2019s objectives are to meet its medium-run inflation target while supporting growth. Growth has fallen steeply while inflation is also above target. The question of what can revive growth as well as reduce inflation is best examined in the context of India\u2019s macroeconomic structure. 32. COVID-19 led to crash in demand as well as disrupted domestic supply chains. As, under gradual unlocks, the latter revive while infections reduce, the supply-side is recovering. The heavy rains raised food prices but also promise a bountiful crop. Over the longer term, structural food surpluses, agricultural reforms and global changes in oil demand and supply can be expected to keep commodity prices soft. Reform is also reducing obstacles that raise production costs in India. Therefore, inflation can be expected to moderate. Research shows commodity price shocks and credible RBI guidance to be major determinants of inflation expectations. 33. India\u2019s many youthful entrants to the labour force as well as migration to higher productivity jobs suggest it has an elastic supply curve but it is one that is subject to upward shocks1. Apart from supply-side features that raise costs, shocks include inflation expectations and changes in exchange rates. Moderating these shocks is the most effective way to reduce inflation in India. 34. Monetary-financial conditions have a relatively greater impact on aggregate demand and output growth while the composition of government expenditure and taxation affects costs. An elastic supply curve implies a demand squeeze has little impact on inflation but creates a large output loss. Moreover, excessive tightness hurts financial stability as much as excessive stimulus does. Necessary reforms over the last decade have improved the credit culture, governance, diversity and robustness in the financial system and conditions are ripe for a turnaround. COVID-19 creates an opportunity for a reversal of tight financial conditions2. 35. COVID-19 also creates uncertainty and precautionary hoarding of liquidity and savings. Therefore demand is now a greater constraint than supply. That inflation exceeds the MPC target when demand has crashed much below potential output suggests lockdown related shocks have pushed up the supply curve. This should reverse as lockdowns ease. That CPI inflation is much higher than WPI for the same items points to issues in retail supply. The CPI itself needs to be rebased to more accurately reflect the lower share of food in the consumption basket. Since the output gap is already so large, reducing demand and increasing the gap further cannot be the way to reduce inflation. Firms do tend to raise mark-ups to cover fixed costs when capacity utilization falls but reducing utilization further will only raise costs more. 36. Although in normal times India\u2019s correctly estimated interest elasticity of demand is high, during crisis times it is difficult to induce more spending just through higher liquidity and lower interest rates. Fiscal deficits have risen countercyclically as tax revenues fell with the lockdowns. Even so, there is scope for further prudent expansion of government spending to boost demand and trigger private spending to raise growth. The expenditure should ideally be designed to relieve supply-side constraints. The ex-post fiscal deficit ratio falls as growth raises the denominator and rising tax revenues reduce the numerator. 37. Financing short-term rise in deficits requires keeping the cost of government borrowing low. Central banks worldwide are taking such actions. The monetary policy resolution committing to benign financial conditions for as long as it takes for revival will help both public and private borrowing and spending. Active and innovative steps, including counter-cyclical macro-prudential regulation, can improve incentives for appropriate action, allay fears, reduce risk aversion, make liquidity more widely available, improve transmission and bring down interest rate spreads. 38. Mitigating the impact of the unprecedented global health crisis has priority. It is important, however, there is neither over-reaction nor untimely reversal. Excess 1 See Goyal, A. 2017. \u2018Macroeconomic Policy for an India in Transition\u2019, Economic and Political Weekly, 52(47): 31-37. Available at https://www.epw.in/journal/2017/47/perspectives/macroeconomic-policy-india-transition.html stimulus after the global financial crisis resulted in excess tightening in the decade that followed. Policy should aim for balance and use available space when it would be most effective. Forward-looking actions are aiming to be state-contingent, carefully calibrated to the evolving situation and to incoming data. Early measures required during the lockdown have been successfully reversed. For example, moratoria given have ended without major adverse impacts on borrowers or the financial system. Banks now do risk-based lending and the credit guarantee from the government allows private banks also to lend to MSMEs. Targeted restructuring and freer movement of liquidity through the economy will help firms survive, so that persistent damage is avoided and the economy recovers faster. 39. Inflation is at present above the target band although it is expected to come down. Therefore no change in the policy rate itself is appropriate while awaiting the impacts of on-going supply-side improvement, as well as for uncertainty around COVID-19 to dissipate. I therefore vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and also to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth, mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The accommodative stance and the benign financial conditions it makes possible, together with the assurance it will not be reversed until the economy recovers, will support growth. The repo rate pause together with inflation expectations. I have agonized a great deal about dissenting (in part) with a resolution on a 40. narrow technicality when I am in agreement with the spirit of the resolution: am I making a mountain out of a molehill and creating unnecessary confusion? After prolonged deliberation, I have come to the conclusion that a dissent may be painful, but it is more consistent with the obligation of MPC members to express their views independently and candidly. Even when a disagreement is more philosophical than operative, it should not always be relegated to the individual statement; I see some merit in occasionally elevating it to a dissent. 41. My preferred formulation of the forward guidance would have been as follows: \u201cThe MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The MPC expects to maintain a low policy rate and an accommodative stance during the current financial year and well into the next financial year.\u201d 42. It differs from the actual MPC resolution in two respects. First, in my formulation, the date based forward guidance is not a decision but an expectation. In a world that is full of unpleasant surprises, the MPC must of necessity be data driven. Covid-19 was an example of a totally unanticipated growth shock that came out of nowhere. If a similarly unforeseeable inflation shock were to hit the economy, I find it hard to believe that the MPC will remain accommodative. In practice, I suspect that the word \u201cdecided\u201d only means an intention to remain accommodative as long as realized outcomes do not diverge drastically from what is currently expected. I am firmly of the view that the MPC risks a damage to its credibility when it uses words that do not accurately reflect what it means. I therefore disagree with the choice of the word \u201cdecided\u201d when it comes to the date based forward guidance in the MPC resolution. 43. Second, my formulation is for a somewhat longer period and explicitly refers to interest rates. In my view, the principal motivation for the forward guidance is the fact that India has one of the steepest yield curves in the world. The Indian yield curve is extremely steep beyond a maturity of about a year: in the short term segment (1-2 years), the intermediate term segment (2-5 years) and the long term segment (5-10 years). However, in the money market segment (up to a maturity of nearly one year), the yield curve is close to the reverse repo rate of 3.35% (which is the effective policy rate today because of the liquidity support). To have the desired impact, it is desirable that the forward guidance extend beyond the one year horizon at which the steepness of the yield curve sets in. Forward guidance of six months in the MPC resolution is in my view suboptimal. I would also point out that the weakness of investments in the Indian economy predates the Covid-19 pandemic, and this merits a longer term response that goes beyond six months. 44. One of the hallmarks of a credible inflation targeting regime is a substantial compression of the inflation risk premium. If the market expects inflation to average close to the target rate of inflation, then, by definition, inflation risk is low and consequently the inflation risk premium should also be very small. What remains is essentially the liquidity risk premium which cannot explain the extraordinary steepness of the Indian yield curve. 45. It appears to me that the steep yield curve reflects a lack of credibility of the MPC\u2019s existing accommodative guidance. The introduction of dated guidance in the MPC resolution is an attempt to solve this problem, and my only difficulty with this solution is the word \u201cdecided\u201d. Just as the brakes allow the car to travel faster, the MPC\u2019s guidance will be more effective if it works alongside and not in conflict with its inflation fighting resolve. I prefer the word \u201cexpected\u201d because it would preserve the commitment of the MPC to respond aggressively to inflation shocks that lie well above the upper band of the fan chart (Chart 1 of the Monetary Policy Statement). 46. I believe that excessively high long term rates are inflicting damage to the economy in two ways. First, a significant part of the easing of policy rates is not being transmitted to longer term rates that form the benchmark for corporate borrowing and investment decisions. Excessive long term rates exacerbate the collapse of investments in the economy. Second, high long term rates cause an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate by stimulating foreign capital inflows into our bond markets at a time when the collapse of investment has caused the current account to swing into surplus. 47. A sharp reduction in long term rates is therefore important. On the other hand, with short term rates already at 3.35%, the incremental benefits of a furthering lowering of this rate in the current macroeconomic environment are relatively low and not commensurate with the risks. So I support maintaining the policy rate at its current level. I also support the accommodative stance and liquidity support that drive short term rates towards the reverse repo rate rather than the repo rate. Statement by Dr. Mridul K. Saggar 48. At the time of the August MPC, while noting that monetary policy was being framed under large data and forecast uncertainties, I had also indicated that growth could fall more and, inflation less, than the consensus estimates that prevailed at that point. Market consensus has since moved significantly. Survey of Professional Forecasters now predicts 2020-21 growth at (-)9.1 per cent, down from (-)5.8 per cent in August and headline inflation to fall to 4.2 per cent in Q4:2020-21, up from 3.0 per cent. The baseline projections in the MPC resolution place growth at (-)9.5 per cent and headline inflation at 5.4-4.5 per cent in H2:2020-21 and 4.3 per cent for Q1:2021-22. The latest projections reaffirm that inflation will fall in line with the target, while growth has plummeted, thus decidedly shifting the growth-inflation policy trade- off in favour of supporting growth within the flexible inflation targeting paradigm. 49. During Q1:2020-21, the economy faced its deepest contraction ever, which was also the worst amongst G20 countries. Despite marked sequential improvements in high frequency indicators of real activity, many of them are yet to normalise to their pre-pandemic levels that were already sub-par as the economy had slowed to a 11-year low in 2019-20. The GDP is likely to contract close to double-digit mark in judgment Q2:2020-21. A range of model-based exercises, as well as my superimposed on these, suggest that output gap in terms of levels of GDP will close only towards the end of 2021-22, even though a technical rebound is likely to push the economy to above average growth in that year on a low base. Investment, that typically comprise about a third of real aggregate demand, contracted 47 per cent in Q1:2020-21. With seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation for surveyed manufacturing firms dropping to 48 per cent in Q1:2020-21, the large slack already visible in 2019- 20 has deepened further. As such, investment may take time to recover. Moving ahead, there is tough row to hoe requiring acorns to be fed in the form of complementary actions to support recovery to trend growth in the coming years. Though inflation is currently above the upper tolerance band, it is not monetary 50. in nature. Supply disruption in food, increase in taxes on fuel and liquor, and surge in gold prices catalysed by risk-off has lifted inflation. Ex-food, \u2018fuel and light\u2019, gold and \u2018pan, tobacco and intoxicants\u2019, inflation stands at 4.4 per cent, i.e. 2.3 percentage points lower than the headline inflation. In my view, headline inflation should start softening from October. Apart from favourable base effects, the unlocking has picked speed and would significantly reduce supply chain bottlenecks causing both agriculture and non-agricultural prices to correct. Monsoon risks to inflation have dissipated. Cumulative rainfall has been 9 per cent above long period average with its temporal and spatial distribution satisfactory. Area sown under Kharif has expanded by 4.8 per cent. Reservoir levels are 15 per cent above last 10-year average, lifting up Rabi prospects. The First Advance Estimates of Kharif point to substantial increase in output of crops like pulses, oilseeds and sugarcane that can have a salutary effect on food and processed food prices and leave enough margin of error for possible subsequent downward revisions in data. With marked increase in area sown under foodgrains, alongside the buffer of food stock at double the norms, prices should soften. Vegetable prices that have exhibited persistence at elevated levels due to weather-related disturbances should also correct starting December. With resumption of businesses by small poultry, high prices in protein items should witness some correction. As yet, there are no signs of generalisation of relative price shock from food items and agriculture and rural wage inflation has stayed muted. 51. The current high retail margins have prevailed as consumers avoid scouting for cheaper prices amidst social distancing. The phenomenon of such less competitive markets have been observed in past pandemics as well, such as the one that contributed to the Eisenhower recession in the United States. However, the unlock intensity now matches the lockdown stringency and with new confirmed Covid-19 cases starting to decline in recent weeks, unless there is strong second wave, supply chains should get near normalised as early as end of the current calendar year, setting off price corrections. However, demand will take time to normalise and weakness may persist into the next year. In these circumstances, corporate pricing power is unlikely to recover, though upside risks to inflation remain from possible collusive behaviour in less competitive industries, as also further unforeseen supply disruptions in food. As a baseline, headline should converge to core inflation, with both softening. Three macro-financial risks currently concern me that have implications for 52. monetary policy. First, if growth contractions stay for long, the hysteresis or scarring that has been substantially arrested by nimble-footed policy actions could stage a comeback creating renewed feedback loops within public, corporate and bank balance sheets that would impact the stock of debt as well as fiscal and saving- investment balances. If this happens, recovering potential output, some of which may be lost to hysteresis, will take longer. It will also push the neutral interest rate lower than before. Despite front-loaded action, monetary policy should, therefore, stay accommodative. The fiscal restraint observed so far provides some room for it. However, with term spreads already widening above historical levels in 2019-20 and in H1:2020-21 on back of widening fiscal gap that has necessitated larger government borrowing programmes, the unpleasant arithmetic is evident in supplies of papers more than doubling in two years. Consequently, the yield curve slope is hardly a predictor of growth or expected inflation. This is not unique to India and term spreads have been higher and have widened much more during current pandemic in many other emerging markets due to pro-cyclical nature of fiscal policies that leave little counter-cyclical space. As typically fiscal authorities have a first mover advantage in the game of chickens, monetary policy will naturally have to factor this in its stance to avert Nash equilibria as a pure strategy. In this milieu, monetary and liquidity easing in India has effectively kept government market borrowing costs at a 16-year low with attendant benefits for funding costs that are obvious but hard to quantify precisely in absence of counterfactual. 53. Second, if current real negative interest rates fall further, it may generate significant distortions that could adversely affect aggregate savings, current account and medium-term growth in the economy. With retail fixed deposit rates currently ranging between 4.90-5.50 per cent for tenors of 1-year or more and the headline inflation prevailing above that for some months now, there has been a negative carry for savers. While expected future inflation is lower and leaves some policy room, it is prudent to hold policy rates for now. 54. Third concern relates to interactions between monetary policy and financial stability, which could intensify further, especially later into next year. Though low for long interest rates risk build-up of corporate and household leverage, unprecedented contraction entails policy-trade-offs imparting primacy to rebuilding consumer and business confidence over the next 2-3 quarters by taking some policy uncertainty out of their decisions. In this milieu, forward guidance can play an important role. 55. Considering all the above, I vote for leaving the policy rate unchanged. Further considering that output gap may close only towards the end of 2021-22 and that, going forward, the demand destruction caused by the pandemic, coupled with improvements in logistic networks of production and distribution, may exert significant downward pressure on headline and core inflation, I vote for the accommodative stance and the forward guidance provided in the resolution. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra economy inflicted by COVID-19. If the NSO\u2019s provisional estimates for Q2 that are expected at the end of November corroborate at least the direction of these forecasts, India has entered a technical recession in the first half of the year for the first time in its history. GDP is an aggregative indicator of economic activity and hides the extent of human misery and the loss of social and human capital caused by the health crisis. Nonetheless, if the projections hold, the level of GDP would have fallen approximately 6 per cent below its pre-COVID level by the end of 2020-21 and it may take years to regain this lost output. There is also an anecdotal sense that the economy\u2019s potential output has fallen, and the post-COVID growth trajectory will look very different from what has been recorded so far. Changes in social behaviour and norms of commercial and workplace engagements may accentuate this structural change. 57. Progressive unlocking of the economy has brought people out of isolation and some high frequency indicators into the green. While this has raised optimism about the much-awaited recovery, perhaps, pragmatic caution is warranted. The COVID curve is arching inwards, from the cities where infections had hitherto festered, into interior regions. The fear of a second wave looms over India; already it has forced lockdowns across Europe, Israel and Indonesia, and India, with the second highest caseload of infections and over-stretched healthcare infrastructure, cannot be immune. In the absence of intrinsic drivers, the recovery may last only until pent-up demand has been satiated and replenishment of inventories has been completed. Empirical evidence suggests that consumption-led recoveries are shallow and short- lived. Exports could be a driver, but with the WTO\u2019s latest projection of a decline in world trade volume by 9.2 per cent in 2020, the role of exports in powering a durable revival is likely to be circumscribed. This underscores the critical role of investment in engineering the turnaround in the economy and sustaining it over the medium-term. Depressed capacity utilisation in manufacturing, inventory overhang in residential housing, impaired balance sheets of corporates and financial institutions, and pervasive business pessimism are combining to create formidable drags on investment sentiment. Consequently, an investment-less recovery is doomed to be ephemeral. Policy intervention accordingly assumes a vital role. Illustratively, public investment can play both a gap-fill and crowding-in role. Monetary policy can engender favourable financing conditions by lowering the cost of capital and by narrowing risk spreads on financial instruments. 58. In the current milieu, however, both monetary policy and fiscal policy in India face tightening constraints, some idiosyncratic. For fiscal policy, it is the collapse of tax revenue \u2013 by 32 per cent in the first quarter; consequently, the centre\u2019s revenue deficit during April-August is 121.9 per cent of budget estimates. For monetary policy, it is the persistence of headline inflation above 6 per cent for the third month in succession. Structural reforms to unlock growth impulses are needed, but may lack social traction in an atmosphere of depressed growth and employment, and high uncertainty. 59. In the context of headline inflation ruling above the upper tolerance limit of the target since June 2020, the role of monetary policy has come under scrutiny. It has been argued that while inflationary pressures may emerge from supply bottlenecks and cost pushes, inflation cannot become generalised and persistent unless it becomes a monetary phenomenon, i.e., it is accommodated by an increase in aggregate demand as reflected in an expansion of money supply or by a decrease in policy interest rates. Monetary policy has adopted an ultra-accommodative stance to revive growth and mitigate the effects of COVID-19. Liquidity operations in support of this stance have infused sizable liquidity into the system, reflected in reserve money expansion of 17.6 per cent adjusted for the first-round effects of cash reserve ratio changes. This has, however, not translated into a commensurate increase in money supply because of a money multiplier depressed by a sharp increase in the currency- deposit ratio, and remunerated reserves parked in reverse repo with the RBI over and above CRR requirements. Consequently, the rate of money supply is averaging 12 per cent in nominal terms and only 6 per cent in real terms. In terms of quarterly seasonally adjusted annualised rates, a negative money gap has opened up recently. In a quarterly vector auto regression (VAR) framework, money supply and 60. policy rate reductions together contribute only 4 per cent of the deviation of inflation from its target. The contribution of supply shocks from food and fuel prices account for 71 per cent of inflation deviations in the first half of 2020-21, followed by 28 per cent from unanchored inflation expectations (deviations of trend inflation from target). Changes in exchange rates and asset prices together contribute a little less than 12 per cent. Inflation is pulled down by 15 per cent by the negative demand shock from COVID-19. 61. Under these conditions, it is essential for monetary policy to remain accommodative and opportunistically exploit the headroom that opens up when inflation recedes, as it is projected in the second half of 2020-21. Three aspects need to be emphasised. First, it is important to separate false starts from durable growth drivers. In this context, all efforts need to be trained on the revival of investment. Second, in the evolving situation in which monetary policy is committed to an accommodative stance, it is necessary to monitor inflation dynamics closely for signs of generalization and persistence. For this purpose, all indicators of aggregate demand, including monetary and credit aggregates, warrant continuous examination for inflation impulses. Third, with unprecedented contractions in economic activity and elevated inflation posing a razor\u2019s edge trade-off fraught with uncertainty, forward guidance has to be clear and decisive. The stance of policy conveys forward guidance on the future trajectory of short-term interest rates, which is well within the MPC\u2019s remit. On this, therefore, communication has to be unambiguous and, given the evolving situation, specific in order to anchor expectations. I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and for retaining the accommodative 62. stance of policy as set out in the MPC\u2019s resolution. 63. After the sharpest contraction in economic activity in Q1:2020-21, a number of high frequency indicators of economic activity for Q2:2020-21 indicate a sequential improvement. The recovery in all likelihood would be led by rural demand. In urban areas too, there are indications of an uptick in consumption demand with passenger vehicles emerging out of contraction in August, rebound in GST e-way bills to pre- pandemic levels, sequential improvement in GST revenues in September and a steady improvement in PMI manufacturing and services. 64. Accordingly, the recovery is expected to be multi-speed depending on sectoral realities. Forward looking surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank are also the recovery. Households expect an indicating a sequential improvement in general economic situation, employment and income over a one year ahead horizon. Capacity utilisation saw some improvement in Q2:2020-21 and a further pick-up is expected from Q3 onwards. Manufacturers expect expansion in production volumes and new orders to continue through Q1:2021-22. Business Expectation Index (BEI) also suggests a move to expansion zone in Q3:2020-21. firming up of There are, however, downside uncertainties that could put sand in the wheels 65. of this nascent recovery. Primary among them is the risk of a second wave of COVID-19. Private investment activity is likely to be subdued, even as domestic financial conditions have eased significantly. External demand is expected to remain anaemic with sharp contraction in global economic activity and trade. Overall, we expect a likely reduction in the rate of contraction in GDP during Q2:2020-21 and a return to positive growth by Q4:2020-21. Despite sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4, the full year GDP is expected to contract by 9.5 per cent with a strong rebound next year. 66. Inflation remained above the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent since June, with signs of aggravation of price pressures. The surge in inflation in India in recent period is in stark contrast with the experience of other major emerging market economies (EMEs) where inflation moderated relative to pre-lockdown period. Adverse supply side factors along with increase in retail margins continue to impinge on food and non-food components of CPI. Food (with a weight of around 46 per cent in overall CPI) contributed disproportionately at around 60 per cent to the surge in inflation. In addition, costs of doing business have gone up due to additional sanitisation related expenditures, social distancing norms and labour shortfalls. 67. On the outlook for inflation, food inflation should moderate going forward on a combination of good kharif harvest and a favourable rabi season. Households polled by the Reserve Bank expect 3-month ahead inflation expectations to somewhat soften. As economic activity further normalises and supplies are restored, cost push price pressures faced by firms are likely to dissipate. However, should supply side shocks, especially to food persist, they can destabilise inflation expectations. Overall, in our assessment, headline inflation would moderate in H2 of the current year and further in Q1 of next fiscal year. through both 68. conventional and unconventional measures, amounting to \u20b912.3 lakh crore or 6.1 per cent of nominal GDP of 2019-20, has helped to keep systemic liquidity in abundance and easy financial conditions reflected in the narrowing of term and risk premia in various market segments. During March-August 2020, monetary transmission improved significantly reflecting the combined impact of surplus liquidity and enhanced coverage of the external benchmark-based pricing of loans. However, despite continued guidance of accommodative stance as long as necessary and ample surplus liquidity, the financial markets remained somewhat nervous and at variance with our expectations. The market participants were also concerned about the stance going forward. 69. Monetary policy works through financial markets which serve as the conduit of transmitting policy signals to the real economy. For seamless propagation of policy impulses, it is necessary that the monetary authority\u2019s policy intent is clearly understood by market participants so that there are no expectational mismatches between the two. Accordingly, MPC should strengthen its forward guidance by indicating that the accommodative stance would continue as long as necessary - at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year - to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. This enhanced guidance should strengthen and quicken the pace of transmission to longer-term yields and help support consumption and investment demand in the economy. Higher investment in conjunction with recent structural reforms measures by the government would help improve supplies and alleviate supply bottlenecks and also contribute to softening of inflation. 70. Monetary policy at this stage has to provide adequate support to ensure a robust revival of the economy from the devastating effects of COVID-19, while at the same time ensuring that any persistence of elevated inflation does not lead to unanchoring of inflation expectations. With the supply side disruptions that are seen to drive the current inflationary pressures likely to be transient and wane out in months ahead as economy normalises, there is merit in looking through the current high levels of inflation and persevere with the accommodative stance for monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis. Moreover, taking into account the projected moderation in inflation and the large output loss, I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged at present and continue with the accommodative stance, during the current financial year and into the next financial year, at the least. This would help to reduce uncertainty and market volatility. This would also enhance confidence in the monetary policy resolve to support the growth recovery process while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. I recognise that there exists space for future rate cuts if the inflation evolves in line with our expectations. This space needs to be used judiciously to support recovery in growth. Meanwhile the ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions would help ease financial conditions further. ", "Dec_2020": "The twenty sixth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from December 2 to 4, 2020. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma joined the meeting through video conference. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall 3. publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 4, 2020) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. The outlook for Q4 (October-December) of 2020 is overcast with a surge in COVID-19 infections in a second wave across Europe, the US and major emerging market economies (EMEs), with accompanying lockdowns. Progress on vaccine candidates has, however, generated some offsetting optimism. World trade recorded a rebound in Q3 as lockdowns were eased, but it is likely to slow in Q4 as pent-up demand is exhausted, inventory restocking is completed, and trade- related uncertainty is rising with the second wave. CPI inflation has remained muted across major advanced economies (AEs) while it picked up in some EMEs on firming food prices and supply disruptions. Global financial markets remain buoyant, supported by highly accommodative monetary policies and positive news on the vaccine. Domestic Economy In India, the data release of the National Statistical Office (NSO) on November 27 showed 7. a contraction of 7.5 per cent in real GDP in Q2:2020-21 (July-September). In Q3:2020-21, high frequency indicators point to a recovery gaining traction, with double digit growth in passenger vehicles and motorcycle sales, railway freight traffic, and electricity consumption in October, although there was moderation in some of these indicators in November. Riding on the favourable monsoon, the outlook for agriculture remains bright, with rabi sowing up 4.0 per cent from the acreage covered at this time last year under supportive soil moisture and reservoir conditions. CPI inflation rose sharply to 7.3 per cent in September and further to 7.6 per cent in October 8. 2020, with some evidence that price pressures are spreading. Food inflation surged to double digits in October across protein-rich items including pulses, edible oils, vegetables and spices on multiple supply shocks. Core inflation, i.e., CPI excluding food and fuel, also picked up from 5.4 per cent in September to 5.8 per cent in October. Both three months and one year ahead inflation expectations of households have eased modestly in anticipation of the seasonal moderation of food prices in the winter and easing of supply chain disruptions. Domestic financial conditions remained easy in October-November and systemic liquidity 9. continued to be in large surplus. Reserve money increased by 15.3 per cent (y-o-y) (as on November 27, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand. Money supply (M3), on the other hand, grew by only 12.5 per cent as on November 20, 2020. A noteworthy development is that non-food credit growth accelerated and moved into positive territory for the first time in November 2020 on a financial year basis \u2013 hitherto, the large inflow of deposits into the banking system was being predominantly deployed in SLR investment. Corporate bond issuances stood at \u20b94.4 lakh crore during April-October 2020 as against \u20b93.5 lakh crore during the same period last year. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were US$ 574.8 billion (as on November 27), up from US$ 545.6 billion on October 2 at the time of the MPC\u2019s last resolution. 10. The outlook for inflation has turned adverse relative to expectations in the last two months. The substantial wedge between wholesale and retail inflation points to the supply-side bottlenecks and large margins being charged to the consumer. While cereal prices may continue to soften with the bumper kharif harvest arrivals and vegetable prices may ease with the winter crop, other food prices are likely to persist at elevated levels. Crude oil prices have picked up on optimism of demand recovery, continuation of OPEC plus production cuts and are expected to remain volatile in the near-term. Cost-push pressures continue to impinge on core inflation, which has remained sticky and could firm up as economic activity normalises and demand picks up. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 6.8 per cent for Q3:2020-21, 5.8 per cent for Q4:2020-21; and 5.2 per cent to 4.6 per cent in H1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in rural demand is expected to strengthen 11. further, while urban demand is also gaining momentum as unlocking spurs activity and employment, especially of labour displaced by COVID-19. These positive impulses are, however, clouded by a possible rise in infections in some parts of the country, prompting some local containment measures. At the same time, the recovery rate has crossed 94 per cent and there is considerable optimism on successes in vaccine trials. Consumers remain optimistic about the outlook, and business sentiment of manufacturing firms is gradually improving. Fiscal stimulus is increasingly moving beyond being supportive of consumption and liquidity to supporting growth- generating investment. On the other hand, private investment is still slack and capacity utilisation has not fully recovered. While exports are on an uneven recovery, the prospects have brightened with the progress on the vaccines. Demand for contact-intensive services is likely to remain subdued for some time due to social distancing norms and risk aversion. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is projected at (-)7.5 per cent in 2020-21: (+)0.1 per cent in Q3:2020-21 and (+)0.7 per cent in Q4:2020-21; and (+)21.9 per cent to (+)6.5 per cent in H1:2021- 22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 2). 12. The MPC is of the view that inflation is likely to remain elevated, barring transient relief in the winter months from prices of perishables. This constrains monetary policy at the current juncture from using the space available to act in support of growth. At the same time, the signs of recovery are far from being broad-based and are dependent on sustained policy support. A small window is available for proactive supply management strategies to break the inflation spiral being fuelled by supply chain disruptions, excessive margins and indirect taxes. Further efforts are necessary to mitigate supply-side driven inflation pressures. Monetary policy will monitor closely all threats to price stability to anchor broader macroeconomic and financial stability. Accordingly, the MPC in its meeting today decided to maintain status quo on the policy rate and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID- 19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 13. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. Further, all members of the MPC voted unanimously to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published by December 18, 2020. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent 15. The prevailing economic scenario has presented both positive developments and concerns. The positive developments have included better than expected GDP growth recovery in Q2: 2020- 21 and promise of vaccines for the Covid-19 becoming available in early 2021. The major concerns are the recent second wave of Covid-19 infections and deaths in Europe and the US leading to shutdowns and the continuation of inflation pressures. 16. The official data on GDP for Q2: 2020-21 released at the end of November 2020 indicates a year-on-year contraction by 7.5 per cent as against our October 2020 assessment of GDP contraction of 9.8 per cent. The positive growth in manufacturing output in terms of gross value added is a major positive indicator of revival of the economic activities. The imminent approvals for vaccines for the Covid-19 pandemic have raised the prospects of return to normal economic activities at the global level, subject of course to all the safety considerations until the vaccination programs cover all the population. The potential for the spread of the virus in the absence of critically vital safety precautions such as masks and social distancing cannot be ignored until the effective vaccination is achieved. 17. The headline CPI inflation rate for October is at 7.6 per cent, after the average inflation in Q2: 2020-21 at 6.9 per cent. The actual inflation rate for Q2 is slightly higher than our expected rate of 6.8 per cent in October. 18. The sustained recovery of the economy to bring back the lost employment and income to the workers remains crucial policy goal and maintaining moderate levels of inflation is equally important to sustain the recovery process. Experience of the previous quarter is an important guide for framing the monetary policy at this juncture. The policy rates were left unchanged in October with Repo rate at 4 per cent and 19. continuation of the accommodative monetary policy stance into the next year. This position appears to have supported a fairly broad based recovery process. This forms the context for my assessment of the economy and the view on the monetary policy resolution. 20. The output performance of the various sectors in Q2: 2020-21, measured in terms of gross value added (GVA) in constant prices, indicates broad based recovery. Year on year basis, Agriculture & allied activities sector registered a growth of 3.4%, Manufacturing 0.6%, Electricity and Utilities 4.4% and in the remaining 5 sectors, growth rate was negative but barring two sectors, the decline over the previous year was less steep than in Q1. In the case of Finance, Real Estate and Professional Services, and Public Administration and Defence & Other Services, the decline 5 was steeper than in Q1. In the case of construction and Trade, Hotels, Transport, Communication and Broadcasting related services, which experienced a decline of close to 50% in Q1, the rate of decline in GDP in Q2 was less than 16%. The recovery of economic activity in Q2 over the level in Q1 is seen in all the sectors, except Agriculture & Allied and Mining & Quarrying. In both these cases, this may be a seasonal feature. For all sectors together, GVA in Q2 increased by 19.4% over Q1. 21. In terms of demand components of GDP, barring Inventory Change and Statistical Discrepancy, all the others show negative year-on-year growth. However, the YOY decline in Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) in Q2 has followed an increase in Q1. In all other cases, the rate of contraction in Q2 is less steep than in Q1. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) and Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) have registered less steep YOY decline in Q2 than in Q1: 2020-21. Importantly, in all the cases, barring GFCE, the level of demand in Q2 is higher than in Q1. The improvement in the level of demand over Q1 along with lower contraction YOY basis signal sustained recovery. Despite the overall improvement in the level of economic activities, there are concerns on 22. the status of some of the sub-sectors and aspects of the economy. There are no clear indications of the extent to which the micro and informal sector enterprises have fared in this phase of recovery. In the case of registered or organised sector, the analysis of unaudited quarterly statements of 2570 listed non-financial private companies conducted by RBI shows that manufacturing firms have managed to achieve profits by reducing input costs and staff costs while facing cuts in value of production. In a scenario where output of the economy contracted by about 24%, recovery is not expected to be uniform across sectors both due to the differences in the nature of supply chains and demand conditions, often leading to \u2018multi-speed recovery\u2019 indicating the difficulties in achieving seamless recovery. Some of the sectors, termed \u2018contact intensive sectors\u2019 such as hospitality and tourism will take longer to recover. The corporate performance in Q2 cited above shows that non-IT services companies fared poorly compared to IT companies. Firms also face increased costs of operation unless the activities resume the pre-Covid pattern of operations. Firms also need to recoup the losses incurred. This will require both improved productivity and higher realisation from sales. 23. A reflection of the disruptions in the production processes is also seen in the rising price pressures. While the rising rate of food inflation is mainly a result of production setbacks, there is also some evidence of price pressures in other sectors. The firming up of commodity prices in the international markets affects domestic prices through either input costs or prices of competing domestic output. The large levels of indirect taxes on petroleum fuels has kept the transport costs high for all sectors. 24. The prospects of sustaining growth recovery through both expansion of growth across sectors and rising growth rates of output in the short term beyond Q2: 2020-21 are seen in some of the \u2018expectations surveys\u2019 and the indicators of economic activity for which data are available with much less time lag. Among the indicators from outlook surveys, RBI\u2019s own survey of manufacturing companies indicates optimism on improved production, order books and employment and on turnover in the case of services and infrastructure sectors for Q3. The optimism is broad based and stronger on the output and employment conditions in 2021-22. RBI\u2019s analysis of the findings of its sample survey of manufacturing companies, based on preliminary partial results, shows that capacity utilisation (seasonally adjusted) increased from 47.9% in Q1 to 62.6% 6 in Q2, but well below the long term average of 74%, highlighting improvement in output but also a significant unutilised capacity either because of supply constraints or lack of demand. 25. Improvement in demand is clearly needed to accelerate production. Growth of agricultural and allied sector GVA by 3.4 per cent in both Q1 and Q2 YOY basis has supported rural demand. The festival season provided one stimulus to demand for consumer goods in Q2, but sustaining that will require both confidence in income stream and safety in work. The sequential pickup in GFCF in Q2 is a sign of pick up in consumption demand expected by the producers. The consumer confidence surveys by RBI reveal an improvement in the expected levels of spending one year ahead compared to the present in November 2020 relative to the findings in September 2020. However, this positive sentiment is yet to catch up with the level seen in pre-Covid period. The uncertainty about the prevailing income and employment conditions appears to be significant. The recovery in economic activities requires support from consumer spending. 26. The external demand conditions remain uncertain. While exports of goods and services show signs of recovery in terms of moderating YOY rates of decline in Q2 over Q1, they are still negative. The net investment inflows, however, have shown positive growth. The forex reserves have increased by $97 billion between November 27, 2020 and end of March 2020. 27. The economic growth momentum presently depends on domestic factors. Financial conditions that support investment are a critical factor in strengthening this link. Fiscal measures that support demand are also a critical factor in strengthening aggregate demand. 28. The prevailing monetary and fiscal conditions represent favourable financial conditions for investment. However, support for the consumer demand will require return of employment and income growth. While government borrowing to finance the fiscal deficit is at a high level, government spending to support investment and consumption are needed at this juncture. Imbalances in the supply and demand conditions are impacting the price scenario as in the 29. case of food inflation. The food inflation has been led by a few commodities, whether it is vegetables or pulses due to production shortfalls. Large price spikes due to sudden supply constraints have affected headline inflation. Arrival of winter crops in the market is expected to bring down the pressures on these commodities. In the present situation, the price pressures are also seen in other sectors, as firms manage lower capacity utilisation and higher costs emerging from the need for greater care to address risks of Covid infections. Firming up of international commodity prices, despite the projected low trade volumes is another indication of supply constraints. These pressures appear to be largely supply related but may be supported by improving demand conditions and are a concern. 30. The forecasts of growth and inflation suggest that economic recovery will continue in the remaining two quarters of 2020-21 and more strongly in the first half of 2021-22. The headline inflation is expected to remain well above 6 per cent in Q3 and below 6 per cent in Q4. The sustained economic recovery leading to a projected positive year- on- year GDP growth in Q3 and Q4 reflects the rising momentum of economic activities built up by the relaxation of restrictions on movement of goods and commerce as the Covid cases have reduced. But this reduction in Covid cases can be sustained only if the norms of social safety \u2013 the masks and social distance- are observed, until mass vaccinations are achieved. The adverse risks to sustained recovery remain on account of the potential for the rise of Covid infections and its impact on both supply and demand. The adverse risks on the price front are also emerging from the supply side considerations. The prevailing conditions require access to liquidity and financial conditions favourable to production 7 and investment on the supply side. High inflation remains a risk but easing these pressures requires easing supply conditions. 31. On balance, the need to support relaxing the supply side constraints is a priority as this is also needed to address inflation concerns. Improvement in demand conditions requires both fiscal support and decline in Covid-19 threat. 32. I vote in support of the resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and further to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Indian Q2 growth rate came in above expectations. One view attributes it to a temporary 33. pent-up demand and festival driven surge. My own view is that just as the reversal of the liquidity drought had led to a revival of growth that was visible in the high frequency data for February 2020, the various measures to make liquidity available through the economy not only helped firms survive but have also revived demand. The bank credit growth figures show a turnaround but underestimate it. For example, reduction in precautionary liquidity hoarding leads to faster payments and unclogs the frozen economy. There are now other sources of market-based finance. Real estate inventory is beginning to move. Both households and firms have deleveraged, are cash rich, and ready to spend. There are early signs of firms beginning to invest. Even so, the kind of infrastructure boom we had in the 2000s will not occur. Moreover, it is not desirable. 34. India seems to have avoided a second Covid-19 peak and vaccines are around the corner. But we must remember growth is still negative. It will take at least a year to reach the earlier peak GDP level and more to recover lost growth. Jobs have been lost, some voluntary and some involuntary, especially in the lower middle class. The turnaround needs policy support until it is well established. 35. Headline CPI inflation has also exceeded expectations. But analysis suggests it is due to multiple supply shocks. Covid-19 and the lockdown was itself a massive supply shock, so much so that there was a break in the inflation series. The headline series being targeted now starts from Q2 (July-September), after the break in the lockdown months when it was not possible to even measure inflation. 36. Research shows household inflation expectations rise if inflation is high and persistent. Then headline inflation begins to affect core. Otherwise it is the reverse. To the extent inflation is due to a variety of supply-shocks coming on one after the other, intrinsic persistence may not have set in as yet. The inflation expectations survey of households shows a sharp 100 basis points fall in 37. current household inflation perceptions between September and November. There is also a mild softening of three month and one year ahead inflation expectations. Household inflation expectations are naive and normally exceed realized inflation. But the direction of change is informative. Professional forecasters all expect inflation to soften in H2 of this fiscal year. Although the margin between consumer and wholesale prices remains high for specific 38. goods suggesting retail supply chains are still disrupted, the fall in household inflation perceptions may be due to easier availability of goods. Fear of shortages makes the consumer willing to pay high prices, but the Indian consumer is price sensitive and will begin to search for lower price alternatives as mobility improves. Such searches may have started. There is a window for supply chains to stabilize. In August rural wages jumped up by 9.5% but since crops are plentiful possible second round rise in food prices may be limited. Although October headline CPI inflation was 7.6%, WPI inflation was only 1.5%. Real 39. rates remain positive for firms with respect to WPI inflation but are negative for households with respect to CPI inflation. There is still a chance CPI inflation may fall steeply in the next few months on supply-side action supported by favourable base effects. If inflation softens, such negative real rates will not persist. Also, the equilibrium policy rate is itself negative when growth rates are negative and output is much below potential, after a once in a century growth shock. 40. As long as the MPC stance is accommodative durable liquidity will be in surplus and short- term rates will not rise above the reverse repo rate. Rates have fallen below the reverse repo because of the combination of excess foreign inflows, intervention and reverse repo access limited only to banks. Even so, excess liquidity is still absorbed. Regulatory exposure norms can help prevent excess low rates driven short-term borrowing that creates risks. 41. The intervention that is raising foreign exchange reserves is required because over- valuation of the rupee can hurt exports, raise country risk and lead to a sharp depreciation later. Prolonged inflows can lead to over-valuation without intervention. Surges and sudden stops of capital flows to emerging markets due to advanced economy quantitative easing have hurt emerging market growth in the decade after the global financial crisis. There are many benefits from openness and from the availability of foreign savings but good management has to smooth shocks, reduce risks and protect the domestic growth cycle. 42. It is possible to sterilize excess durable liquidity from expansion in foreign exchange reserves, even while durable liquidity remains sufficiently in surplus to be able to absorb exogenous shocks such as outflows or changes in government cash balances. Giving greater access to reverse repo aids market development as well as short-term sterilization. Liquidity management tools can be used at any time. It is necessary to be watchful, however. To the extent it is transient the contribution of excess liquidity to cost push inflation is 43. limited. In an open economy import competition also caps price rise, especially with a rupee that is tending to appreciate, provided tariffs and taxes are moderated. 44. To continue the delicate balance between lowering inflation, anchoring inflation expectations yet strengthening the growth recovery, I vote to maintain the status quo in policy stance and rates. 45. At the outset, let me reiterate my disagreement with the use of the word \u201cdecided\u201d in the forward guidance part of the resolution. My reasons for this disagreement have been articulated at length in my individual statement for the October 2020 meeting, and rather than repeat them ad nauseam, I would prefer to incorporate them by reference. I also indicated in the October statement that disagreements that are more philosophical than operative need not always be elevated to a dissent, and accordingly I choose not to dissent this time. 46. I wrote in my individual statement for the October 2020 meeting that \u201cwith short term rates already at 3.35%, the incremental benefits of a furthering lowering of this rate in the current macroeconomic environment are relatively low and not commensurate with the risks\u201d. Since then, short term rates have fallen by a further 40 basis points. (The cutoff yield in the last 91-day T-bill auction before the October meeting was 3.36% while the corresponding yield for the last auction before the December meeting was 2.93% \u2212 a drop of 43 basis points). I believed then and believe now that this reduction of rates carries significant risks and very little rewards. The rewards are low because long rates are what are relevant for stimulating investments and supporting an economic recovery; a steepening of the yield curve by a reduction in short rates does not accomplish this. Also, a reduction in long rates that stimulates investment not only increases demand in the short run, but it also stimulates supply in the medium term as the new capacity becomes operational, and this new supply dampens inflationary pressures. By contrast, the demand that is stimulated by a reduction in short rates is not accompanied 47. by an offsetting supply boost, and therefore carries greater inflationary risks. A sub 3% short rate (corresponding to a negative real interest rate of \u22124.5%) risks encouraging speculative inventory accumulation and stoking inflationary buildup in sectors that are showing incipient anecdotal signs of cartelization and resurgence of pricing power. Anecdotal evidence suggests that in several sectors which are characterized by an oligopolistic core and a competitive periphery, the oligopolistic core has weathered the pandemic well and it is the competitive periphery that has been debilitated. Rising profits and profit margins, improving capacity utilization and lack of new capacity additions create ripe conditions for the oligopolistic core to start exercising pricing power. These are also the enterprises that are benefiting from borrowing at rates below the policy corridor through commercial paper issuance. I fear therefore that a sustained failure to defend the policy corridor could prove expensive in terms of creating inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations though, so far, low rates have been feeding into asset markets rather than goods price inflation. It is pertinent to note in this context that the IIM Ahmedabad\u2019s business inflation expectations survey released just before the MPC meeting reported an increase in inflation expectations. 48. Turning to the resolution, I indicated in my individual statement for the October 2020 meeting that monetary policy must remain accommodative \u201cas long as realized outcomes do not diverge drastically from what is currently expected.\u201d It must be admitted that realized growth and inflation have both drifted towards the edge of the fan charts while remaining within them. Nevertheless, it is my considered view that the balance of risk and reward at the current juncture is still in favour of monetary accommodation. Therefore, I support maintaining the policy rate at its current level. I also support the accommodative stance and liquidity support that drive short term rates towards the reverse repo rate rather than the repo rate, while being wary of a drop below the corridor. The MPC must continue to be data driven and must continue to monitor future developments carefully. 49. Central banking has not been usual once the pandemic set in. Supporting growth was a natural priority given the cliff effects of pandemic on aggregate demand and supply. Monetary policy is now entering into a more complex zone. While growth is recovering faster than earlier anticipated, it has not yet taken sustainable roots. It remains to be seen how it might respond ahead as pent-up demand wanes while animal spirits remain anaemic. Furthermore, fiscal impulse has weakened since Q2:2020-21 and, therefore, despite inflation persistence, pulling back the monetary support to aggregate demand will not be an apt choice at this juncture. High inflation has persisted longer than predicted at the time of the preceding MPC meeting in early October. This was mainly due to unseasonal rains that caused vegetables price spike. As a base case, inflation should still start correcting in near months and fall below the upper-tolerance levels by December 2020. The upside risks, however, remain with some evidence that price pressures are starting to get distended. 50. Notwithstanding the remarkable improvement in activity levels, as also captured by normalisation of several high frequency indicators, there are several reasons to believe that growth will stay below trend for the rest of the year, even though positive terrain may be reached before close of the current fiscal year. The sharp recovery seen in indicators relating to auto sales cannot be interpreted as being reflective of the underlying trend in aggregate demand or supply conditions as pent-up purchases were being delayed, first on account of transition to stricter emission standards that kicked in since April and then on account of pandemic related lockdowns. Services sector accounted for 63 per cent of the gross value added and contributed 78 per cent to the overall growth over preceding two years. Several services continue to be deeply affected by the pandemic. These include hospitality, construction, real estate, trade, and several types of transport, even though railway freight movement has normalised. Investment demand which had significantly contributed to overall growth in 2017-18 and 2018-19 had dropped off in 2019-20 and was the main driver of the growth contraction during Q1:2020-21 and despite remarkable sequential improvement in Q2 is likely to stay weak, with capacity utilisation rate likely staying below 70 per cent against long-term average of 74.0 per cent. Non-food credit, a leading indicator for growth stays muted, though in the fortnight ended November 6, 2020, it jumped to 5.7 per cent year-on- year from 5.1 per cent in the preceding fortnight. It could be the turning point in credit offtake but is not clear at this stage and, in any case, it has not yet acquired strength to alter the growth-inflation trade. 51. Furthermore, in Q2:2020-21, government final consumption expenditure contracted by 22.2 per cent and public administration, defence and other services by 12.2 per cent, dragging the growth down in terms of weighted contribution to growth by 2.9 percentage points from the demand-side and 1.7 percentage points from the supply-side, respectively; lower supply-side contraction essentially reflected improvement in \u2018other services\u2019. The fiscal support to growth has nevertheless come from automatic stabilisers that have been stronger than in many emerging markets but remain weaker than in advanced economies, especially as they act through fall in tax revenue but have no automaticity to increase spending. The discretionary fiscal policies, therefore, become important but policy space has been limited by largely procyclical fiscal policies followed for years. In this backdrop, fiscal policy has attempted restrained counter-cyclical support since 2019-20. Going forward, growth is likely to get some support from fiscal spending in the remaining months of this fiscal year when bulk of the on-budget stimulus is likely to be spent. Given that fiscal multipliers are higher during large downturns and also that investment multipliers distinctly 11 exceed revenue spending multipliers, the growth-targeting investment measures announced as part of additional stimulus in October and November are likely to complement monetary policy support to growth in a measured way. Though monetary policy so far has provided a bungee cord to the growth, its tensile 52. strength depends on how inflation evolves ahead. The nature of inflation still remains predominantly supply driven but with addition of some elements of cost-push inflation that can get a further fillip if three is a feedback from recent increased rural wage inflation. Cost-push inflation, even when arising from factors such as increasing food and energy prices, especially crude oil, and higher direct taxes, can start below the natural rate of unemployment if monetary accommodation is large and sustained. The Great Inflation episode after the oil price shock of 1973 bears testimony of these risks to which one needs to be mindful, even though recent flattening of Phillips curve has diminished correlation between core inflation and output. A decade back, post- global financial crisis, pushing demand continually, did result in resurgence of inflation in India. These risks are not imminent at this point. Since February 2020 policy, RBI has announced liquidity measures adding to about Rs 12.7 trillion. A significant portion of this liquidity has been parked back at central bank window. Therefore, it has not had a perverse effect on inflation so far. Through the interest rate, credit and confidence channels it prevented credit from dropping as steeply as nominal GDP. It also helped in maintaining total flow of resources to commercial sector at about last year\u2019s level with the help of 58 per cent higher corporate bond issuances by non- financial entities during April-October 2020 compared with same period in the preceding year. So, this large liquidity infusion served a very important role in preventing meltdown of markets in Q1 of 2020, reversing the spike in financial spreads observed in March, averting acute credit crunch, thwarting tightening of financial conditions that could have plummeted economy into a deep recession with its domino effects on financial stability that could have further complicated policy choices. 53. The money supply growth so far this year has been reasonable. It has accommodated the shock to growth and substantially compensated for the steep drop in velocity of money that saw demand for currency to spike in Q1. However, going forward, at a point when expansion of activity takes firmer roots, recalibration of policies will become essential. In my assessment, given that output gap will close only in H2 of 2021-22, there is time to normalise monetary policy. As the pandemic shock created a huge negative output gap, even with high weight to core inflation along with lower weights to headline inflation and output gap, the projected path of these variables leaves time before policy rate hikes will become necessary. This is simply because the pandemic shock has left a huge negative output gap. If output gap closes faster than anticipated, core CPI inflation surges on back of observed momentum in some WPI inflation components or more supply-side shocks lead to generalisation of inflation, policy will need to respond appositely. I am labouring to explain this point because accommodative monetary policy has been misread by some as demise of inflation targeting. Quite to the contrary, current policies are consistent with the flexible inflation targeting mandate and hard empirical calculations of how monetary policy needs to react to projected path for key variables. The framework itself has delivered unambiguous gains in disinflating the economy and lowering inflation expectations. 54. Monetary policy under the inflation targeting strategy requires policy to be informed by economic analysis. Liquidity, credit and monetary aggregates will need to be closely monitored in this context with an eye on macro-financial stability that can be enervated when short-term borrowing costs fall below the operational policy rate. If this results in persistence of negative real rates for too long, it can adversely affect savings, lend support to mispricing of financial asset prices and encourage excessive leveraging. As such, other policies outside the flexible inflation targeting framework, such as macroprudential and strengthening the instruments of sterilisation in view of surge in capital inflows in recent months may be needed to mitigate these risks. 55. Considering the growth and inflation projections and other considerations enumerated above, I vote to keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. I also vote for retaining the accommodative stance and accompanying forward guidance. 56. I vote for status quo on the policy rate at this juncture and to maintain the accommodative stance of policy as articulated in the October 2020 resolution: as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 57. The preponderant weight assigned by the monetary policy committee (MPC) to growth relative to inflation since the outbreak of COVID-19 appears to be yielding dividends \u2013 a much shallower than anticipated contraction in the economy in Q2:2020-21; strengthening incoming data in Q3 so far. A Beveridge-Nelson type trend cycle decomposition of real GDP (seasonally adjusted) indicates that the economy is perched on the shoulder of the recovery phase of the underlying cycle. Investment, followed by exports and private consumption, are the drivers of the recovering demand momentum, offsetting the drag from the decline in government spending. In terms of trends, government spending and exports remain stable, but private consumption and investment are on a downward trajectory. 58. As for the proximate indicators of aggregate demand embodied in the monetary aggregates \u2013 seasonally adjusted and smoothed by 5-year annualised averages \u2013 currency in circulation is still on the upswing and driving up reserve money, but the broader measures of deposits, bank credit and money supply are stabilising from a prolonged decline that started in 2010. In fact on a financial year basis, credit growth turned positive for the first time in 2020-21 in November. 5 6 9 - r p A 7 9 - r p A 8 9 - r p A 9 9 - r p A 0 0 - r p A 1 0 - r p A 2 0 - r p A 3 0 - r p A 4 0 - r p A 5 0 - r p A 6 0 - r p A 7 0 - r p A 8 0 - r p A 9 0 - r p A 0 1 - r p A 1 1 - r p A 2 1 - r p A 3 1 - r p A 4 1 - r p A 5 1 - r p A 6 1 - r p A 7 1 - r p A 8 1 - r p A 9 1 - r p A 0 2 - r p A On the supply side, manufacturing, followed by construction and trade services, are leading 59. the cyclical upturn. Business optimism is also reflected in the buoyancy in order books and the pick-up in capacity utilization of manufacturing and services firms. 60. With growth gaining cyclical momentum, the window available to the MPC to look through inflation pressures is narrower than before. The wedge of 6.1 percentage points between WPI and CPI inflation in the October 2020 readings is elevated relative to the historical record \u2013 an average of 3.0 percentage points between 2015 and 2019, and 4.3 percentage points in February 2020 before COVID struck. More than half of this divergence is due to a combination of retailer margins in food prices (amplified by its higher weight in CPI than in the WPI), the sharp increase in taxes on petroleum products and alcoholic beverages in the post-COVID period (which are not captured in the WPI), and high prices of non-traded services such as healthcare, transport and personal services. Depressed input costs are widening the gap on the downside. Costs of sanitisation, social distancing, and of doing business have contributed to the higher retail mark- ups in goods and services, and thereby to the difference between WPI and CPI inflation. Elevated inflation has checked in and may be here to stay. With retailers striving to recover 61. lost incomes, it is unlikely that margins will ease in the near-term. Meanwhile, households recouping lost incomes may work towards keeping the supply price of services elevated. Returning cyclical demand, backed by improving business and consumer expectations, may allow a higher pass-through of input prices into selling prices as businesses endeavour to preserve profit margins. This is also reflected in expectations of surveyed manufacturing firms and persisting pessimism among consumers on the price situation. Economic activity is recovering but hesitantly and unevenly. This warrant continuing 62. policy support till it is set on a firm trajectory of self-sustaining expansion. At the same time, the confluence of forces determining inflation outcomes and their likely persistence imparts downside risks to growth, unless contained early. Amidst this high uncertainty, the MPC\u2019s dilemma around its window of accommodation has become more acute than at the time of its last meeting. 63. Over the last two months it has become increasingly clear that the recovery underway is faster than what was anticipated at the time of the October policy, although it must also be noted that overall activity is still below its level a year ago. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have continued unabated, posing challenges for monetary policy. 64. The Q2:2020-21 contraction in GDP turned out to be lower than projected at the time of October 2020 policy. In Q3:2020-21 so far, various high frequency indicators also suggest further strengthening of the momentum in economic recovery. Rural demand continues to be the main driver of growth with rabi sowing progressing well due to congenial soil and reservoir conditions. Urban demand is also showing signs of turning a corner. The Reserve Bank\u2019s consumer confidence survey of urban areas has registered a marginal uptick in November 2020 from its trough in September. Optimism on early vaccine availability has also boosted economic sentiments. 65. As per my assessment, the recovery is multi-speed as more sectors are showing an upturn, though the improvement is not steady and continuous yet. In October, there was a double-digit growth in passenger vehicles and motorcycle sales, railway freight traffic, and electricity consumption. Demand conditions in the manufacturing sector, according to the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, improved notably during Q3:2020-21 over Q2:2020-21, driven by easing of lockdowns and re-opening of businesses. Early results of order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey suggest that the capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector is recovering, increasing to 61.7 per cent in Q2:2020-21 from 47.3 per cent in Q1:2020-21, although still lower than its long-term average. The expansion of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to 10 more sectors is expected to boost manufacturing and exports. 66. Investment demand in the economy is still to gain traction even as the transmission of policy rate actions has been sharper and quicker. Corporate bond yields have seen a significant reduction. Investment-related indicators such as imports and production of capital goods and consumption of steel and cement posted some sequential improvement in October. Corporate finances in Q2:2020-21 indicated some signs of recovery in demand conditions with profit margins rising due to savings in expenditure. Debt servicing capacity for manufacturing companies, measured by interest coverage ratio, improved in Q2:2020-21 with rise in profits. While investment in fixed assets is muted, increased cash holdings, reduced leverage and improved profitability suggest that investment activity could rebound quickly as conditions normalise with the flattening of the COVID curve and the availability of vaccines. 67. Non-food credit growth in November 2020 accelerated and moved into positive territory on a financial year basis for the first time in 2020-21. Total flow of resources to the commercial sector from banks and non-banks is also running close to last year, thus creating enabling domestic financial conditions to sustain and strengthen the recovery process. Since February 6, 2020 the Reserve Bank has announced liquidity augmenting measures of \u20b912.7 lakh crore (6.3 per cent of nominal GDP of 2019-20). Reflecting the various liquidity management measures and the supportive market operations undertaken by the Reserve Bank in fostering market confidence and strengthening financial stability, there has been a narrowing of term and risk premia in various market segments. Yields on government securities, commercial paper (CP), 91-day treasury bills, certificates of deposit (CDs) and corporate bonds have softened appreciably. Corporate bond spreads have broadly receded to pre-COVID levels. 15 The fiscal measures announced so far are a balanced mix of consumption, liquidity and 68. investment measures, which have been sequenced as per the evolving situation. A calibrated shift in focus from consumption expenditure under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP) to liquidity support under AatmaNirbhar 1.0 to investment expenditure under AatmaNirbhar 2.0 and 3.0 is clearly visible. On the whole, it is expected that the calibrated stimulus provided by the government is likely to flow through the economy through multiple channels - private consumption, fixed capital formation and push from the supply side. Increase in government expenditure during the remaining part of the year will provide further impulses to growth. Given the large multipliers for capital spending, the recent trend of cuts in States\u2019 capital outlays needs to be reversed. As strong capex multipliers for both central and state capital expenditure kick in, crowding in of private investment could take place, all of which is critical during a revival phase. Overall, the recovery is likely to gain further traction in Q3:2020-21 and Q4: 2020-21. 69. On inflation front, a combination of cost-push factors including supply side disruptions, sharp increase in international commodity prices, high retail margins and elevated taxes on petroleum products by both Centre and States have kept inflation above the upper tolerance band of the inflation target. The October 2020 CPI surprised on the upside, both in terms of the extent and depth of price pressures. Going forward, stronger measures to address the supply side issues and the winter 70. moderation in vegetable prices should result in some softening in inflation from its current levels. Continuing demand supply mismatches in protein-based food and edible oils would require active supply side measures. The Reserve Bank is constantly engaged with the concerned authorities for undertaking supply-side measures to contain inflation. The improved prospects of a bumper kharif harvest and favourable rabi season should also keep cereal prices in check. The inflation expectations survey of households indicates a modest softening in both three-month and one-year ahead inflation expectations, though median inflation expectations continue to remain at elevated levels. 71. Overall, the persistence of inflation at elevated levels constrains monetary policy at the current juncture. At the same time, though recovery is underway, there is still continuous need to nurture and support growth to make it broad based and durable. A premature roll back of the monetary and liquidity policies of RBI would be detrimental to the nascent recovery and growth. The overall situation needs to be monitored carefully, both in the sides of growth and inflation. On balance, therefore, I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. We need to monitor closely all threats to price stability and possible spill overs to broader macroeconomic and financial stability. The Reserve Bank will continue to respond to global spill overs to secure domestic stability with our liquidity management operations. The various instruments at our command will be used at the appropriate time, calibrating them to ensure that ample liquidity is available in the system. (Yogesh Dayal) Press Release: 2020-2021/804 Chief General Manager ", "Feb_2021": "The twenty seventh meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from February 3 to 5, 2021. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma joined the meeting through video conference. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting on February 5, 2021 decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. The global economic recovery slackened in Q4 (October-December) of 2020 relative to 6. Q3 (July-September) as several countries battle second waves of COVID-19 infections, including more virulent strains. With massive vaccination drives underway, risks to the recovery may abate and economic activity is expected to gain momentum in the second half of 2021. In its January 2021 update, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised upward its estimate of global growth in 2020 to (-)3.5 per cent from (-) 4.4 per cent and increased the projection of global growth for 2021 by 30 basis points to 5.5 per cent. Barring some emerging market economies, inflation remains benign on weak aggregate demand, although rising commodity prices carry upside risks. Financial markets remain buoyant, supported by easy monetary conditions, abundant liquidity and optimism from the vaccine rollout. Global trade is also expected to rebound in 2021, with services trade on a slower recovery than merchandise trade. The first advance estimates of GDP for 2020-21 released by the National Statistical Office 7. (NSO) on January 7, 2021 estimated real GDP to contract by 7.7 per cent, in line with the projection of (-)7.5 per cent set out in the December 2020 resolution of the MPC. High frequency indicators \u2013 railway freight traffic; toll collection; e-way bills; and steel consumption \u2013 suggest that revival of some constituents of the services sector gained traction in Q3 (October-December). The agriculture sector remains resilient - rabi sowing was higher by 2.9 per cent year-on-year (y- o-y) as on January 29, 2021, supported by above normal north-east monsoon rainfall and adequate reservoir level of 61 per cent (as on February 4, 2021) of full capacity, above the 10 years average of 50 per cent. 8. After breaching the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent for six consecutive months (June-November 2020), CPI inflation fell to 4.6 per cent in December on the back of easing food prices and favourable base effects. Food inflation collapsed to 3.9 per cent in December after averaging 9.6 per cent during the previous three months (September-November) due to a sharp correction in vegetable prices and softening of cereal prices with kharif harvest arrivals, alongside 2 supply side interventions. On the other hand, core inflation, i.e. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated at 5.5 per cent in December with marginal moderation from a month ago. In the January 2021 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, inflation expectations of households softened further over a three month ahead horizon in tandem with the moderation in food inflation; one year ahead inflation expectations, however, remained unchanged. Systemic liquidity remained in large surplus in December 2020 and January 2021, 9. engendering easy financial conditions. Reserve money rose by 14.5 per cent y-o-y (on January 29, 2021), led by currency demand. Money supply (M3), on the other hand, grew by only 12.5 per cent as on January 15, 2021, but with non-food credit growth of scheduled commercial banks accelerating to 6.4 per cent. Corporate bond issuances at \u20b95.8 lakh crore during April-December 2020 were higher than \u20b94.6 lakh crore in the same period of last year. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 590.2 billion on January 29, 2021 \u2013 an increase of US$ 112.4 billion over end-March 2020. 10. With the larger than anticipated deflation in vegetable prices in December bringing down headline closer to the target, it is likely that the food inflation trajectory will shape the near-term outlook. The bumper kharif crop, rising prospects of a good rabi harvest, larger winter arrivals of key vegetables and softer egg and poultry demand on avian flu fears are factors auguring a benign inflation outcome in the months ahead. On the other hand, price pressures may persist in respect of pulses, edible oils, spices and non-alcoholic beverages. The outlook for core inflation is likely to be impacted by further easing in supply chains; however, broad-based escalation in cost-push pressures in services and manufacturing prices due to increase in industrial raw material prices could impart upward pressure. Furthermore, there could be increased pass-through to output prices as demand normalises as indicated in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook, services and infrastructure outlook surveys and purchasing managers\u2019 indices (PMIs) and firms regain pricing power. International crude oil prices may remain supported by demand build up on optimism from vaccination and continuing production cuts by OPEC plus. The crude oil futures curve has become downward sloping since December 2020. Taking into consideration all these factors, the projection for CPI inflation has been revised to 5.2 per cent in Q4:2020-21, 5.2 per cent to 5.0 per cent in H1:2021-22 and 4.3 per cent in Q3: 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). 11. Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand is likely to remain resilient on good prospects of agriculture. Urban demand and demand for contact-intensive services is expected to strengthen with the substantial fall in COVID-19 cases and the spread of vaccination. Consumer confidence is reviving and business expectations of manufacturing, services and infrastructure remain upbeat. The fiscal stimulus under AtmaNirbhar 2.0 and 3.0 schemes of government will likely accelerate public investment, although private investment remains sluggish amidst still low capacity utilisation. The Union Budget 2021-22, with its thrust on sectors such as health and well-being, infrastructure, innovation and research, among others, should help accelerate the growth momentum. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is projected at 10.5 per cent in 2021-22 \u2013 in the range of 26.2 to 8.3 per cent in H1 and 6.0 per cent in Q3 (Chart 2). 12. The MPC notes that the sharp correction in food prices has improved the food price outlook, but some pressures persist, and core inflation remains elevated. Pump prices of petrol and diesel have reached historical highs. An unwinding of taxes on petroleum products by both the centre and the states could ease the cost push pressures. What is needed at this point is to create conditions that result in a durable disinflation. This is contingent also on proactive supply side measures. Growth is recovering, and the outlook has improved significantly with the rollout of the vaccine programme in the country. The Union Budget 2021-22 has introduced several measures to provide an impetus to growth. The projected increase in capital expenditure augurs well for capacity creation thereby improving the prospects for growth and building credibility around the quality of expenditure. The recovery, however, is still to gather firm traction and hence continued policy support is crucial. Taking these developments into consideration, the MPC in its meeting today decided to continue with an accommodative stance of monetary policy till the prospects of a sustained recovery are well secured while closely monitoring the evolving outlook for inflation. 13. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide; Dr. Ashima Goyal; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar; Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra; and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent. Furthermore, all members of the MPC voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during April 5 to 7, 2021. The First advance estimates (FAE) of GDP for 2020-21 released by the National Statistical 16. Office (NSO) on January 7, 2021 place the annual growth of GDP in constant prices at -7.7 per cent over the previous year. The NSO notes that these estimates are likely to see sharp revisions in view of the limitations of the data used, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The official estimates of GDP for Q3: 2020-21 are expected to be available only in the last week of February along with the Second Advance Estimates for 2020-21. 17. The sectoral level breakup of annual output growth reveals that the steepest decline in FY 21 is in the services (including construction) by 9.2% followed by a decline of 8.5 per cent in industry over the previous year. Agriculture & Allied Sectors GVA increased by 3.4 per cent as per FAE. Key to projected sustained recovery in output performance in FY21 after the sharp decline in Q1 remains with (1) sustained growth of agriculture and allied activities and (2) output of industry and services in H2: FY21 reaching close to the levels of H2: FY20. 18. The pattern of growth recovery across sub-sectors of the economy points to the emergence of sustained recovery, although there are risks associated with the nascent nature of the recovery, which requires support from both its internal dynamics and exogenous factors. Internal dynamics refers to the interlinkages across sectors and the supply chains including global linkages and translation of improving supply conditions to investment decisions. As many of the external restrictions on movement and activities due to the pandemic are now lifted, the impact of such liberalisation is evident in many indicators available for Q3: 2020-21. The indicative results on sales or turnover for a sample of 445 listed non-financial private companies indicate positive growth in the case of manufacturing and IT firms. In the case of non-IT services firms, sales growth in Q3 is negative but less contractionary than Q2: 2020-21. A survey of manufacturing companies by RBI shows improved capacity utilisation for Q3: 2020-21. High frequency data for the months of October-December show high year on year growth rates for railway freight e-way bills, and trade transactions reflected in the GST collections. In the case of e-way bills and GST collections the growth rates are slightly lower in January 2021 but remain high. The important concerns relate to the demand conditions. The rise in demand in the \u2018festival season\u2019 played its part in catalysing consumer demand during September-November period and sustaining this demand requires restoration of household income and employment. 19. The surveys of business sentiments and outlook indicate improvement in the business conditions from the severe shock in Q1: 2020-21. The RBI\u2019s survey of enterprises (Industrial Outlook Survey) shows improvement in demand conditions in Q3: 2020-21 in the case of manufacturing, services and infrastructure. Demand conditions are expected to improve further in Q4: 2020-21 and in the first two quarters of 2021-22. Business sentiments are clawing back to the levels seen just before the onset of lockdowns due to the pandemic. Enterprise survey indicates that firms are planning to hire more workers and the staff costs in the case of organised sector show increase in Q3: 2020-21 year-on-year basis, compared to the decline in the previous quarter. The overall picture that emerges is one of improving business conditions and expectations of sustaining this trend into the next few quarters. One of the pre-requisites of sustained economic recovery is the control over the pandemic. 20. The recent data suggests that the incidence of new infections has declined. However, the experience in several countries suggests that there is need to be cautious on this score and the decline in new infections and mortality cannot be taken for granted, especially in view of the new strains of the Corona virus. Availability of vaccines has provided much needed confidence that the pandemic would give way to restoration of normal economic life, even if gradually. The ongoing recovery, based on the perceptions of decline of new infections, will require all measures to sustain this decline in reality. Accelerated progress of vaccinations and access to the key health services to battle new infections would be a crucial factor in maintaining the confidence of producers and consumers in the economy. 21. The cautious consumption expenditure outlook is reflected in the findings of RBI\u2019s Consumer Confidence Surveys. The improvement in Consumer Confidence reflected in the assessment of expenditure is significant in the longer one-year horizon than the present situation. The improvement seen in November 2020 dropped marginally in January 2021 survey, both in the current period and one year ahead. As per the FAE, the government final consumption expenditure rose by 5.8 per cent in FY21 as a whole, while the private final consumption expenditure declined. 22. While measures to address the local and domestic conditions related to both the economy and the pandemic have borne fruit, the global conditions appear diverse as far as the pandemic is concerned. While the vaccinations are making progress in the Advanced Economies, there has been a rise in Covid infections in the winter months. The World Economic Outlook by IMF has projected the world output to rise in 2021 by 5.5 per cent after the decline by 3.5 per cent in 2020. The output growth in 2021 after the decline in 2020 is projected for both Advanced Economies and Emerging Market Economies. Among the major economies, only China has managed to show a positive output growth in 2020. The World Trade Volumes of goods and services are also expected to recover from the steep decline in 2020. The global demand scenario has become optimistic but will face the challenge of restoring the disrupted supply chains. 23. Recovery in investment demand is a key factor in sustaining the economic recovery. As per the FAEs, the Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) declined by 14.5 per cent in FY 21, year on year basis. The GFCF had also decreased, year on year basis, in 2019-20 based on provisional estimates for 2019-20. The IIP for capital goods increased in October 2020, year-on-year basis, for the first time after December 2018. The IIP for infrastructure and construction goods, linked to investment spending has also shown positive growth in the two consecutive months, September and October 2020. Part of the explanation for the weak investment demand appears to be weak capacity utilisation in industry. Therefore, sustaining the on-going improvement in the demand conditions to restore capacity utilisation levels is necessary to catalyse investment demand. The strong FDI inflows in April-November 2020, surpassing the levels in the same period a year back point to the attractiveness of investment in the country but revival of the broader domestic investments is yet to be realised. The Union Budget 2021-22 has laid out a number of growth orientated policies and 24. programs, that include increased expenditure in specific sectors and also capital expenditure. Given the sharp reduction in revenues in FY21, the fiscal consolidation path now sets the fiscal deficit target below 4.5 per cent of GDP by 2025-26 from 9.5 per cent in FY21 and budget estimate of 6.8 per cent for FY22. High rates of economic growth sustained over the medium term will be needed to achieve fiscal consolidation. 25. The need for revival of economic activities back to the pre-pandemic levels and then at a pace that is consistent with income and employment goals remains prominent in the present economic policies. As the supply side restrictions are lifted, revival of demand in terms of consumption, investment and exports is needed to sustain economic recovery. 26. The recovery of economic activity from the pandemic shock has also been accompanied by relatively high rates of retail inflation. Between June and November 2020, the inflation rate has ranged between 6.2 and 7.6 per cent, in each month. The rate declined in December 2020 to 4.6 per cent. While the recent rise and decline in the inflation rate were amplified by food inflation, the core inflation has remained between 5.4-5.9 per cent during July - December 2020. The prospect of good rabi crop harvest is expected to exert downward pressure on the agricultural commodity prices in the coming months. Easing of the pressures in the non-food sector will require easing of some of the key input costs such as transportation services and energy, both by improved supply conditions and productivity. Easing the price pressures in the non-food sector will be required to achieve revival of consumer demand as well. 27. The present scenario reflects continued revival of the economy after the severe decline in GDP in Q1: 2020. For the financial year 2020-21 as a whole, the FAE by NSO estimate GDP to decline by 7.7 per cent over the previous year, indicating the severity of the shock in Q1. The economy is expected to reach the GDP level of Q3 of 2019-20 by the third quarter of 2020-21. The sustained economic recovery will require continued decline in the number of Covid infections to regain consumer confidence with successful roll out of vaccinations being a key strategy to achieve this. Accommodative monetary policy stance is needed to strengthen ongoing economic 28. recovery enabling expansion of both output and demand. 29. I vote in support of the resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and further to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 30. In the months since the December 2020 MPC meeting growth has exceeded market expectations and headline inflation has also come in below expectations, falling within the MPC tolerance band after 6 months. The country has done well in avoiding a second peak until now under a well-sequenced gradual unlock, careful testing and tracing. Its vaccination drive has begun. New more deadly variants of the virus remain a risk, however, requiring continuing care and acceleration of vaccination. 31. Although growth has turned positive, output levels remain below 2019 levels. Excess capacity continues, supply chains have room to normalize much further, and unemployment rates have increased despite a recovery in employment, because of the rise in labour participation rates as willingness to work rose with the waning of Covid-19 fears. While corporate India has done well, and consumer confidence is reviving, reliable data is still awaited on the resilience of the informal sector. 7 32. The timing and sequence of policy support has been crucial over the last year. Early liquidity support, moratorium and government warranties were vital for survival. Some of these measures have been reversed yet the financial sector remains healthy. Banks are reporting much lower than expected NPA growth as well as restructured loans as the early revival has enabled repayment. Short term rates have risen to the reverse repo rate reducing risks, US Treasury bill rates 33. are also moving up yet Indian long term rates, more important for demand, remain low and plentiful liquidity continues to sustain activity. Excess liquidity with the financial system is absorbed at the Reverse Repo window, or using other instruments, implying risk created is minimal. Money supply growth remains moderate, even as there is some rise in credit growth through diverse instruments. Quick response and very gradual withdrawal is a mantra that works for macroeconomic policy as well as for India\u2019s response to Covid-19. Supply chains improved after unlock 4 in September 2020, which prevented states from 34. imposing arbitrary restrictions on inter-state travel, in time for the festival demand stimulus. Public spending could take a backseat in Q2 and has revived in Q3. In Q4 and over the next year it has sought to increase the share of investment, which has a larger multiplier since it also improves the supply-side, thus lowering inflation and enabling monetary support through lower interest rates1. The budget stimulus is largely through better quality spending, while the deficit itself reduces moderately. This relative fiscal conservatism also enables monetary policy flexibility to keep borrowing costs low. 35. Inflation presents a mixed picture. Prices of many food products have softened bringing down headline inflation. Profiteering in retail supply has not been able to withstand excess supply, although data shows only the beginning of reduction in retail margins. 36. Core inflation, however, remains near the upper band. The severe winter Covid-19 second spikes in many countries have kept global supply chains disrupted and raised prices of many intermediate goods and commodities. As demand revives local firms are able to pass on the rise in costs. But this is likely to be temporary, although uncertainty remains about the timeline. Rapid vaccination is already moderating spikes abroad making room for the supply response to improve. Oil has a much faster supply response now because of shale oil as well as green substitutes, capping future rise in prices. Gold prices that impact Indian core inflation are falling as vaccination spreads. 37. For the last so many years manufacturing inflation has been low in India\u2014a factor responsible for the wide gap between WPI and CPI inflation. One reason is India is a very competitive price sensitive market. Manufacturers pricing power is temporary and will not survive the full resumption of supply it will attract. Many firms have reduced costs over the last year, which also gives them the ability to absorb some rise in input prices. Mark-ups tend to be counter- cyclical, falling as capacity utilization rises and fixed costs are spread. The fall in short-term household inflation perceptions shows that households are observing 38. improvements in retail supply\u2014as yet more for perishables. Sustained double-digit one year ahead inflation expectations seem to be due to higher uncertainty since the dispersion across households\u2019 expectations has risen. There is evidence of some success in anchoring expectations in the inflation 1 See Goyal, Ashima and Bhavya Sharma. 2018. \u2018Government Expenditure in India: Composition, Cyclicality and Multipliers\u2019. Journal of Quantitative Economics, 16(1): 1-39. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/s40953-018-0122-y. targeting period2. That inflation has returned within the tolerance band even in the very difficult Covid-19 period should further improve its credibility and reduce uncertainty. The current macroeconomic configuration and its expected future evolution as outlined 39. above implies there is space for the MPC to continue to support the revival of the economy with inflation remaining in the target band. Therefore, I vote to maintain the status quo in policy rate and stance. I support maintaining the policy rate at its current level and I also support the 40. accommodative stance as these decisions are consistent with the forward guidance provided by the MPC in its last two meetings (October and December 2020). With both inflation and growth outcomes being well within the range of expectations of the MPC, and short term interest rates being within the corridor defined by the repo and reverse repo rate, there is nothing to be done and there is nothing to be said as of now. The MPC must of course continue to be data driven and must continue to monitor future developments carefully. The MPC call to hold policy rates despite inflation staying elevated above the upper 41. tolerance level during H2 of 2020 was based on the assessment that inflation will recede going forward. This was a difficult call given the observed persistence in inflation. It enabled the monetary policy to afford a countercyclical support to growth in a rather critical period that could otherwise have resulted in extensive scaring of big and small businesses and a large hysteresis in aggregate output. Had this happened, India\u2019s growth trajectory would have been pulled down for a long time to come. There was recognition of risks while taking this call, especially as there was some evidence 42. that price pressures were starting to get distended with elements of cost-push pressures emerging. Nevertheless, when CPI data was available only till August, in my statement at the October MPC I stated that vegetable prices should correct starting December. Vegetable prices dropped 15.7 per cent month-over-month in December, bringing headline inflation down from 6.9 per cent to 4.6 per cent - within the tolerance band for the first time in seven months. This inflation correction bears testimony to careful projections and judgment that by keeping policy accommodative, enabled avoiding what could have been a costly policy mistake. 43. Since monetary policy is forward-looking, there is little point in looking back except for the limited purpose of drawing lessons. Given the long and variable transmission lags, we now need to focus on carefully assessing not just the baseline inflation trajectory but also the risks to it, the nature of inflation and its internals going forward. 44. Two things are noteworthy. First, bulk of the food-price correction in CPI has already happened. From the DCA data till January it looks that food prices are at near bottom and though they may start firming up from Q1:2021-22 with some price build up aided partly from firming food and non-food international commodity prices, high food inflation like last year is unlikely to 2 See Goyal, Ashima and Parab Prashant 2020. What Influences Aggregate Inflation Expectations of Households in India? Journal of Asian Economics, Available online November 20, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1049007820301408 be repeated. However, cost-push increases may come from higher crude oil prices that will feed into costs, especially fertiliser prices and as they get factored in MSPs. Second, some upside risk to inflation comes from core inflation stickiness and its 45. persistence at elevated levels that may make the task of keeping the headline at the 4 per cent target a challenging one. There is evidence that firms are able to pass on cost push increases by raising retail prices. Early corporate results for Q3:2020-21 suggests that margins are rising steeply in automobiles and components, metals, chemicals, capital goods, health care services, telecommunication and real estate. Not all of this is through cost saving. Price hikes have been reported in items of iron ore, steel, automobiles, yarn, textiles, chemical and chemical products, rubber products besides oilseeds and edible oils, some of which may get reflected in next three months in WPI and CPI indices. Mineral oil prices have also witnessed increases. 46. There is a significant probability that global oil prices may turn out to be markedly higher than the current prevailing prices given the possibility of a large US dollar depreciation this year and signals sent last month by the largest OPEC oil producer by announcing additional supply restraint. Even though the relationship between dollar movements and oil prices has relatively weakened in recent years, the large dollar invoicing of global commodities trade can not only cause an upswing in commodity prices but through financial market interdependencies may cause ripple effects in asset prices, inflation and business cycles. Effect on equities of changes in global nominal and real bond yields and financial market spillovers to EMEs may particularly cause macroeconomic shifts. How the challenges of trilemma amid capital flow volatility are handled with less than corner solutions will influence the monetary policy and inflation outcomes, though a weaker dollar ceteris paribus also means stronger rupee, which will somewhat offset the effect of firmer global oil prices. 47. However, one can draw considerable comfort from the fact that the core inflation stickiness is embedded in our baseline projections and fully accounts for the trend in momentum. Also, empirical exercises suggest that while the passthrough from 1 per cent change in WPI non-food manufactured products inflation to CPI core goods inflation is likely to be about 0.20 per cent, the passthrough is much less for overall CPI core inflation and even lesser to headline CPI inflation. However, this passthrough is time varying and depends on output gap. When IIP output gap is positive, the passthrough on an average is about double that when it is negative. Though strong momentum in core goods CPI has taken its inflation to 6.9 per cent, some solace comes from the fact that ex-gold, petrol. diesel and liquor, the core goods inflation is only at 4.9 per cent. Also, as contact services may take long to normalise, core services inflation is unlikely to surge in near term. So, as of now the risks of headline inflation coming back are, therefore, contained in line with our projections. 48. So, let me turn to growth. I will just make two points. First, faster than anticipated, most manufacturing and rural high frequency indicators have already normalised past pre-pandemic levels. However, services sector indicators such as commercial vehicle sales, registration of transport vehicles, three-wheeler sales, domestic and international air passenger traffic, international cargo, railway passenger traffic, retail and recreation and foreign tourist arrivals are languishing much below those levels. Second, hysteresis is visible to some degree with anecdotal evidence of some micro-enterprises and informal unincorporated household enterprises having permanently closed production shops. Quantitative estimates using a range of methods show that even without further disruptions, output gap is unlikely to close before 3Q:2021-22 and more likely only by the end of the next fiscal year. As growth is still fragile, support to it need to be extended into Q1:2021-22 and longer if necessary, though with risk of a re-calibration in some scenarios such as one in which core inflation momentum picks up further. Since this is not the baseline and 10 the announced exit dates for various measures are planned at a very gradual pace, the process of change in policy can be non-disruptively achieved. In my October statement, I had stated that as fiscal authorities have a first mover advantage 49. in the game of chickens, monetary policy will naturally have to factor this to avert Nash equilibria. With the second successive year of very large gross market borrowing, this is even more important. Monetary policy will need to lean against the wind to keep interest rates low to the extent possible. If central bank open market operation purchases are moderate, it entails the risk of crowding out of private investment; if they are large, it carries risk of reengineering inflation. However, with capacity utilisation rate currently at 63 per cent in Q2:2020-21 and likely to be about 70 per cent by end of the year, capex funding need of private sector are currently limited and the monetary- fiscal coordination to support a larger public investment that can crowd-in private investment can work so long as it is followed by an unflinching commitment to strong fiscal consolidation thereafter. 50. In conclusion, going forward, while efforts should continue to extend output expansion and close output gap, a necessary concomitant for monetary policy is to secure price stability. With headline inflation having already corrected as supply shocks have substantially faded, keeping inflation around the target is the best contribution monetary policy can make to fortify and sustain growth. In my statement, I have focussed more on risks than the baseline. In my view, the baseline is still consistent with supporting growth through accommodative policy stance in near term. Therefore, I vote to keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. I also vote for retaining the accommodative stance and accompanying forward guidance. Statement by Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra 51. Macroeconomic outlook. Estimates/projections indicate that GDP growth may have attained positive territory in the second half of 2020-21, mainly on the back of a surge in government expenditure but contractions in private consumption spending are also easing and net exports are finally emerging out of a long retrenchment. Foreign investment flows are already scenting the imminent upturn. On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities are clearly demonstrating resilience in the face of the pandemic, and manufacturing activity is gradually limping back to growth on the back of recovery in sales. This is also evident in rising capacity utilization. With stronger demand conditions and still moderate costs, operating profits are improving across the board. Some categories of services such as information technology, construction, real estate, finance, domestic trade and transport are slowly healing from the deep scars left by the virus but several other categories of services remain deeply wounded due to their contact-intensity. Consumer and business confidence is either cautiously returning to expansion or already in it. These developments vindicate the stance of monetary policy. have shifted brightened 52. The most heartening feature of the recent shifts is the large fall in inflation, taking it closer to the target after 6 months of persisting outside the tolerance band. If the sharp disinflation in vegetable prices extends into the spring, headline inflation can ease further, empowering the conduct of monetary policy. Meanwhile, mending of supply chains and normalization of activity is underway, especially recouping of lost incomes by both households and businesses, and that is keeping mark-ups and blue-collar wages elevated. It is worthwhile to note that households have internalised this outcome in their near-term inflation expectations polled in January 2021 \u2013 while current inflation perceptions and expectations three months ahead have declined, those for a year ahead remain flat amidst considerable uncertainty. Upside risks to the outlook for inflation persist. First, core inflation remains stubborn and 53. will warrant close monitoring as it has the potential to render the recent fortuitous improvements in the macroeconomic outlook stillborn. Second, rising international commodity prices are being watched the world over with concern as heralding the return of inflation. For India, the relentless hardening of international crude prices is worrisome, especially as their impact on inflation is amplified by disproportionately high excise duties. Third, crude and other commodity prices are translating into higher inputs costs, especially in an environment in which demand is recovering. Pricing power could gain bite as normal demand flows gather traction. Fourth, the flush of capital flows favouring emerging market economies, including India, has imparted volatility to asset prices and increased the risks of imported inflation. Overall, the near-term outlook for inflation appears less risky than the near-term 54. challenges for growth which warrant continuing policy support, at least until the elusive engine of investment fires and consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand in India, stabilizes. Trade- offs facing the conduct of monetary policy may become sharper in the near-term, however. First, shocks to economic activity from the winding down of exceptional pandemic measures will have to be balanced against the persuasive incentive to continue with them but with the risk of becoming immobilized in liquidity traps. Second, concerns about financial stability have risen. The recent new highs scaled by equity markets could be driven by irrational exuberance; it is difficult to tell in an environment of exceptionally low interest rates all around, large corporate profits but still no capex to write home about, and high levels of market borrowings. Banks have stronger capital buffers than during the global financial crisis, but stress in the financial sector\u2019s balance sheets could intensify as the camouflage of moratorium, asset classification standstill and restructuring fades. Capital infusion and innovative ways of dealing with potential loan delinquencies need to occupy the highest policy attention so that the embryonic recovery in credit growth can be nurtured into a more durable the macroeconomic recovery. Strong complementarities are emerging between financial and macroeconomic stability. The best results will obtain when monetary policy ensures that the nominal anchor is firmly moored. 55. the accommodative stance of policy. Against this backdrop, I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged and for maintaining The macroeconomic environment \u2013 in terms of both growth and inflation \u2013 turned out to 56. be better than anticipated since the December 2020 meeting of the MPC. These outcomes, along with the sharp reduction in COVID-19 infections in the country and the rollout of the vaccination programme, have brightened the outlook even though some uncertainties remain. The Union Budget 2021-22 has given further impetus through a qualitative shift in expenditure which will boost overall investment with multiplier effects on growth. Foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment to India have surged in recent months, reposing faith in an impressive recovery of the Indian economy. 57. On the global economy front, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its January 2021 update, has revised upward its projection of global growth for 2021 which augurs well for our external demand and exports. 58. High frequency indicators suggest that the economic recovery is normalising fast in both rural and urban areas. The agricultural sector has been resilient throughout the pandemic and its prospects appear bright in view of higher rabi sowing and comparatively better reservoir levels. Manufacturing activity is picking up. Although initial revival was propelled by pent-up demand, indications are that growth impulses are now being driven by pick-up in activity across manufacturing and services. Forward looking surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank signal greater optimism from manufacturing with the expectation of an expansion in production volumes and new orders in Q4:2020-21 and the following two quarters. The purchasing managers\u2019 index for manufacturing is in expansionary zone and was above its long-period average in January 2021. 59. Trends in railway freight traffic, toll collection, goods and service tax collections, e-way bills and steel consumption suggest that services sector activity is also recovering. The purchasing managers\u2019 index for services is in the expansion territory. Services and infrastructure sector reported increase in turnover in Q3 and expected further improvement through Q2:2021-22 as reported by firms participating in the Reserve Bank\u2019s services and infrastructure survey. 60. The multiple dimensions of normalisation of economic activity, as reflected in the movement of coincident and proximate high frequency indicators, suggest that in 2021-22 the Indian economy will expand by about 10.5 per cent over 2020-21. These projections are based on the assessment of multispeed recovery which is underway, wherein some sectors are witnessing smart recovery, while consumption in contact intensive sectors, being discretionary in nature, could be postponed in near to medium-term. 61. Inflation which remained above the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent consecutively since June 2020, registered a larger than anticipated softening to 4.6 per cent in December, a drop by 2.3 percentage points from the November reading of 6.9 per cent. Around 90 per cent of this fall in headline inflation in December was on account of sharp movement of vegetables into double-digit deflation as prices crashed from highly elevated levels supported by robust winter arrivals and favourable base effect. This trend is likely to be further buttressed by an expected bumper kharif harvest and the rising prospects of a good rabi crop. Further softening in food inflation \u2013 both substantial and durable \u2013 would, however, be dependent upon the abatement of price pressures that are currently seen in pulses, edible oils, spices, and non-alcoholic beverages. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained elevated at 5.5 per cent in December, due 62. to inflationary impact of rising crude oil prices and high indirect tax rates on petrol and diesel, and pick-up in inflation of key goods and services, particularly in transport and health categories. Proactive supply side measures, particularly in enabling a calibrated unwinding of high indirect taxes on petrol and diesel \u2013 in a co-ordinated manner by centre and states \u2013 are critical to contain further build-up of cost-pressures in the economy. Domestic financial conditions continued to remain accommodative to help nurture the 63. recovery. The liquidity provision of \u20b912.9 lakh crore (comprising 6.3 per cent of nominal GDP of 2019-20) since February 6, 2020 has kept systemic liquidity in surplus mode with average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) at around \u20b95.9-6.0 lakh crore in December-January. Reflecting the various liquidity management measures, domestic financial conditions have eased considerably as reflected in the narrowing of term and risk premia in various market segments. Reserve money rose by 14.5 per cent y-o-y (on January 29, 2021), while money supply (M3) grew by only 12.5 per cent as on January 15, 2021. 64. The RBI\u2019s liquidity operations, together with credible communication and explicit forward guidance have been important elements of our strategy during recent times. Explicit forward guidance goes a long way in soothing market apprehensions, particularly when sentiments are frayed during uncertain times. While \u201cstate-based\u201d forward guidance or data contingent forward guidance was used occasionally by the MPC in the pre-COVID period, since October 2020 the MPC has started to offer \u201ctime-based\u201d forward guidance. The commitment to keep accommodative 13 stance \u201cduring the current financial year and into the next financial year\u201d is reflective of a time- based guidance; whereas on the other hand, the expression \u201cto revive growth on a durable basis\u201d characterises a state-based guidance; i.e., guidance contingent on the state of the economy. Going ahead, market participants need to factor in the forward guidance with respect to the two-phase normalisation of the cash reserve ratio (CRR) which opens up space for a variety of market operations to inject additional liquidity through instruments like open market operations (OMOs), among others. 65. Consistent with the accommodative stance of the monetary policy, the Reserve Bank remains committed to ensure the availability of ample liquidity in the system to foster congenial financial conditions for the recovery to gain traction. 66. Growth, although uneven, is recovering and gathering momentum, and the outlook has improved significantly with the rollout of the vaccine programme in the country. The growth momentum, however, needs to strengthen further for a sustained revival of the economy and for a quick return of the level of output to the pre-COVID trajectory. The sharp correction in food inflation has improved the near-term headline inflation outlook, although core inflation pressures persist. Given the sharp moderation in inflation along with a stable near-term outlook, monetary policy needs to continue with the accommodative stance to ensure that the recovery gains greater traction and becomes broad-based. On balance, I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary \u2013 at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year \u2013 to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. ", "Apr_2021": "\ufffd\u0947\u0938 \ufffd\u0915\u093e\u0936\u0928\u0940 PRESS RELEASE The twenty eighth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from April 5 to 7, 2021. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma joined the meeting through video conference. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall 3. publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. 4. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. Resolution 5. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (April 7, 2021) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting in February, lingering effects of the slowdown in the global 6. economy in Q4 of 2020 have persisted, although recent arrivals of high frequency indicators suggest that a gradual but uneven recovery may be forming. The much anticipated boost to economic activity from the vaccination rollouts is being somewhat held back by new mutations of COVID-19, second and third waves of infections across countries and unequal access to vaccines more generally. World trade activity improved in Q4:2020 and January 2021. There are, however, concerns due to COVID-19-related fresh lockdowns and depressed demand in a few major economies, escalation in shipping charges and container shortages. Inflation remains benign in major advanced economies (AEs), although highly accommodative monetary policies and large fiscal stimuli have added to concerns around market-based indicators of inflation expectations, unsettling bond markets globally. In a few emerging market economies (EMEs), however, inflation is ruling above targets, primarily driven by firming global commodity prices. This has even prompted a few of them to raise policy rates. Equity and currency markets have been turbulent with the increase in long-term bond yields and the steepening of yield curves. More recently, however, calm has returned and major equity markets have scaled new peaks in March, while currencies are trading mixed against a generally firming US dollar. With the bond markets sell- offs, EME assets came under selling pressure and capital outflows imposed depreciating pressures on EME currencies in March. 7. The second advance estimates for 2020-21 released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on February 26, 2021 placed India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) contraction at 8.0 per cent during the year. High frequency indicators \u2013 vehicle sales; railway freight traffic; toll collections; goods and services tax (GST) revenues; e-way bills; and steel consumption \u2013 suggest that gains in manufacturing and services activity in Q3:2020-21 extended into Q4. Purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) manufacturing at 55.4 in March 2021 remained in expansion zone, but lower than its level in February. The index of industrial production slipped into marginal contraction in January 2021, dragged down by manufacturing and mining. Core industries also contracted in February. The resilience of agriculture is evident from foodgrains and horticulture production for 2020-21, which are expected to be 2.0 per cent and 1.8 per cent higher respectively than the final estimates of 2019-20. 8. Headline inflation increased to 5.0 per cent in February after having eased to 4.1 per cent in January 2021. Within an overall food inflation print of 4.3 per cent in February, five out of twelve food sub-groups recorded double digit inflation. While fuel inflation pressures eased somewhat in February, core inflation registered a generalised hardening and increased by 50 basis points to touch 6 per cent. 9. System liquidity remained in large surplus in February and March 2021 with average daily net liquidity absorption of \u20b95.9 lakh crore. Driven by currency demand, reserve money (RM) increased by 14.2 per cent (y-o-y) as on March 26, 2021. Money supply (M3) grew by 11.8 per cent as on March 26, 2021 with credit growth at 5.6 per cent. Corporate bond issuances at \u20b96.8 lakh crore during 2020-21 (up to February 2021) were higher than \u20b96.1 lakh crore during the same period last year. Issuances of commercial paper (CPs) turned around since December 2020 and were higher by 10.4 per cent during December 2020 to March 2021 than in the same period of the previous year. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 99.2 billion during 2020- 21 to US$ 577.0 billion at end-March 2021, providing an import cover of 18.4 months and 102 per cent of India\u2019s external debt. Outlook 10. The evolving CPI inflation trajectory is likely to be subjected to both upside and downside pressures. The bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21 should sustain softening of cereal prices going forward. While the prices of pulses, particularly tur and urad, remain elevated, the incoming rabi harvest arrivals in the markets and the overall increase in domestic production in 2020-21 should augment supply which, along with imports, should enable some softening of these prices going forward. While edible oils inflation has been ruling at heightened levels with international prices remaining firm, reduction of import duties and appropriate incentives to enhance productivity domestically could work towards a better demand-supply balance over the medium- term. Pump prices of petroleum products have remained high. Reduction of excise duties and cesses and state level taxes could provide some relief to consumers on top of the recent easing of international crude prices. This could slow down the propagation of second-round effects. The impact of high international commodity prices and increased logistics costs are being felt across manufacturing and services. Finally, inflation expectations of urban households one year ahead showed a marginal increase than over the three months ahead horizon according to the Reserve Bank\u2019s March 2021 survey. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is now projected as 5.0 per cent in Q4:2020-21; 5.2 per cent in Q1:2021-22, 5.2 per cent in Q2, 4.4 per cent in Q3 and 5.1 per cent in Q4, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand remains buoyant and record agriculture 11. production for 2020-21 bodes well for its resilience. Urban demand has been gaining strength on the back of normalisation of economic activity and should get a fillip with the ongoing vaccination drive. The fiscal stimulus from increased allocation for capital expenditure under the Union Budget 2021-22, expanded production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme and rising capacity utilisation (from 63.3 per cent in Q2 to 66.6 per cent in Q3:2020-21) should provide strong support to investment demand and exports. Firms engaged in manufacturing, services and infrastructure polled by the Reserve Bank in March 2021 were optimistic about a pick-up in demand and expansion in business activity into 2021-22. Consumer confidence, on the other hand, has dipped with the recent surge in COVID infections in some states imparting uncertainty to the outlook. Taking these factors into consideration, the projection of real GDP growth for 2021-22 is retained at 10.5 per cent consisting of 26.2 per cent in Q1, 8.3 per cent in Q2, 5.4 per cent in Q3 and 6.2 per cent in Q4 (Chart 2). 12. The MPC notes that the supply side pressures on inflation could persist. It also notes that demand-side pull remains moderate. While cost-push pressures have risen, they could be partially offset with the normalisation of global supply chains. On imported inflation from global commodity prices, urgent concerted and coordinated policy actions by Centre and States can mitigate domestic input costs such as taxes on petrol and diesel and high retail margins. The renewed jump in COVID-19 infections in certain parts of the country and the associated localised lockdowns could dampen the demand for contact-intensive services, restrain growth impulses and prolong the return to normalcy. In such an environment, continued policy support remains necessary. Taking these developments into consideration, the MPC decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 13. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. Furthermore, all members of the MPC voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on April 22, 2021. 13. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged. Furthermore, all members of the MPC voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 14. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during June 2 to 4, 2021. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent The Second Advance Estimates by the National Statistical Office place the GDP at 16. constant prices lower by 8 per cent in 2020-21 over the previous year, slightly steeper decline than decline of 7.7 per cent as per the First Advance Estimates. Source of deeper contraction in GDP has been the lower net taxes on products as the GVA decline was lower at 6.5 per cent in the second advance estimates compared to 7.2 per cent in the First Advance Estimates. These estimates are subject to further revisions but the order of decline in output contraction in FY 21 has been sharp and the present estimates of GVA or GDP are lower than in 2018-19. This pattern holds for private final consumption expenditure and gross fixed investment and, exports and imports of goods and services. The pace of recovery of output needed to offset the negative impact of the Covid 19 shock to the economy in terms of growth in income and employment will be substantial and sustained over many years. 17. The rise in GDP quarter over quarter, since the initial sharp decline in Q1:FY21 provides a basis for more robust future growth. After a massive decline in GVA in Q1:FY21, manufacturing sector registered positive year on year growth in Q3 and implicitly in Q4, based on projected GVA for Q3 and full year FY21 in the Second Advance Estimates. Year on year growth in Construction and Financial and Real Estate and Professional Services sectors turned positive in Q3:FY21 after two quarters of decline. 18. An important source of growth of output during the pandemic phase of FY21, has been agriculture and allied activities sector, as the rural areas appear to have been relatively less affected by the pandemic, allowing production related operations uninterrupted. The GVA from agriculture increased by 3 per cent over the previous year, the only sector among the major sectors to register growth of over 1 per cent. 19. Although there is a positive growth in Q3:FY21, the gross fixed investment in expected to register a decline for the year as a whole over the previous year. The private final consumption expenditure is projected to be lower in Q3:FY21 compared to Q3:FY20. The exports and imports of goods and services for Q3:FY21 and FY21 as a whole are projected to be lower than in the previous year. These indicators reflect the subdued demand conditions in FY21. 20. The indicators such as improvement in capacity utilisation in manufacturing; turnover of business for the firms in the services, particularly in the IT services; and infrastructure sectors available from RBI\u2019s enterprise surveys; bank credit and GST revenue do point to the pickup of economic activities in Q3 and ahead in the non-agricultural sectors. However, RBI\u2019s March 2021 survey of consumer confidence, suggests that a large proportion of the respondents assess the prevailing economic conditions and income to have worsened compared to a year ago. The forward looking consumer expectations also reflect weakened sentiments compared to the previous quarter. The revival of economic activities in Q3:FY21 points to the resilience in the economy but 21. a broad based recovery covering all the production sectors and the micro, small and medium enterprises and employment to support consumption demand is needed to sustain this revival. 22. The improvement in growth performance in the final two quarters in FY21, therefore, is fragile and will require strong policy support for broadening and sustaining positive momentum. The external demand conditions also point to uncertainty although growth in some of the advanced economies is expected to improve. The measures put in place during FY21 to support growth such as the production linked incentives and the push for capital expenditure and infrastructure in the Central budget 2021-22 provide a positive push to economic activity. 23. The sustained growth will also depend on an effective control over the pandemic that would permit economic activities. As the rise of Covid infections and resulting local restrictions on the movement of people in March shows, controlling the spread of infections in essential for sustained economic recovery. Going forward, success of vaccinations, universal adoption of preventive measures to severely limit the chances of transmission of the virus and investment in health services to assure access to health care will define the course of economic recovery. As many have noted, the critical factor affecting sustained revival of the economy will be the victory in the battle over the Corona virus. 24. The headline inflation dropped below the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent for monetary policy for three consecutive months from December 2020. The drop is mainly on account of easing of food inflation. There is hardening of consumer price inflation for fuel and light and particularly the core inflation. The international commodity prices for food, energy and metals show upward trend partly reflecting the global economic recovery. In the domestic market, the producer prices for manufactured products, reflected by WPI show significant rise in prices since December 2020. RBI\u2019s March 2021 Inflation Expectations Survey of Households, points to expectations of higher inflation rate for three months ahead and one year ahead as compared to the expectations held in the previous survey. The CPI inflation rate in the short run is projected at less than 5.3 per cent for the four 25. quarters of FY22, although the risks to the projected trajectory from external sector, type of the south-west monsoon and the pattern of recovery of the domestic economy remain. 26. Expansion of supply of goods and services in public and private spheres will require new investments and access to funds. The monetary policy environment so far has provided support to sustaining economic activities and recovery of growth. Such policy environment is needed to strengthen and broaden the ongoing recovery process. I vote in support of the resolution to keep the repo rate under the liquidity adjustment 27. facility (LAF) unchanged at 4 per cent and also to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 28. Growth uncertainty has increased with the second wave in Covid-19 in some states. RBI surveys show consumer confidence to be lower in March 2021 compared to January, although corporate confidence was still intact. Exports have increased as some countries recover. Second waves in many countries have been sharp but short. The effect on growth could be marginal if complete lockdowns and bans on interstate movement are avoided. The nature of the virus and its ability to mutate imply too much unlocking can create a surge. Large gatherings are especially dangerous. 29. Tightening should be gradual, however, not reversing for long beyond the unlock 4 in September 2020 that forbade restrictions on interstate movements and led to a sustained revival of economic activity. Compared to past pandemics we have the advantage of fast creation of vaccines, but it will take some months for vaccination to reach a critical mass. In the interim, people have learnt to live and keep working with the virus, with technology creating some substitutes for high contact activities. The surge is a warning, however, to raise the level of care and precaution. The medical infrastructure can come under severe strain. 30. Even the above ten per cent growth most analysts still expect for 2021-22, however, will barely take us to the level we had reached in 2019. We have to also make up for lost time; alleviate widespread job loss and income stress. Expected growth is high because of the base effect and does not imply sustained growth at potential. Only when we reach the latter will true recovery have taken place. 31. While banks do not see turnaround in investment as yet there is a rise in alternative financing for manufacturing and a response to government incentives. A new investment cycle, however, will not be like the infrastructure boom of the 2000s, but will build up slowly. In the rest of the world credit leads investment, in India it follows and credit ratios are very low by world standards. With easier financing conditions and a healthier financial sector, there is a chance of a credit-led cycle this time. To the extent investment rises, potential growth will also rise with it. 32. While headline inflation is expected to remain well within the MPC\u2019s tolerance band over this year, core inflation has been rising. Perishables supply chains resolved faster under the pressure of fresh supplies. Something similar will happen with manufactured goods, although it will take more time, since global factors are involved. Oil prices have already come off the boil and there are several factors that are working towards reducing them. Imported commodities have a large weight in WPI. Rising WPI is a temporary Covid-19 related digression, although the new surge may cause some delay in reversion to normal. Historically, wholesale inflation has ruled much lower than consumer price inflation. The base effect, however, will also raise WPI inflation over the next few months. 33. Despite all the emphasis on cost pressures, many firms have undertaken cost cutting measures. RBI\u2019s analysis of the corporate sector in Q3 2020-21 shows a sharp rise in profit before tax. Rise in raw material and staff cost was not material, and margins were steady\u2014there is space to absorb a temporary rise in costs and firms will do it as restoration of supply chains increases competition. Urban retail margins rose somewhat in March 2021. But households do not expect this 34. rise to last. The survey of household inflation expectations showed a rise in current and 3 month inflation expectations but 1 year ahead expectation remained almost the same. The monsoon is expected to be normal. Transmission of low rates set by the MPC remained robust in the banking system. While 35. real short rates are negative, real longer-term rates are positive. Transmission faltered in markets over the last 2 months. Taylor rules, estimated assuming negative output gap and headline inflation at 5 per cent above the 4 per cent target, suggest short rates should range from 3.2 to 3.65 per cent. But some short rates had risen above this. This is incompatible with low overnight rates, an accommodative stance and durable liquidity in clear surplus. 36. The spread of the 10-year G-Secs over short rates was 60 basis points over 2011-17 before rising sharply in 2018. The current spread of over 200 basis points, despite large OMO support, points to markets being caught in an irrational trap. They did not respond to positives such as government borrowing less than announced as well as better tax revenues. Bond markets are subject to disruption where they expect rates to rise and do not buy, so that rates rise, debt becomes unsustainable and fears are self-fulfilling. This is one reason why many central banks around the world have announced explicit support for a temporary Covid-19 related rise in borrowing requirements. Indian markets also need firm and clear guidance. Once market fears recede interventions required would reduce. India\u2019s cautious approach to capital account convertibility means that volatile fixed income 37. flows are still capped at 6 per cent of outstanding stocks of G-Secs. Large foreign exchange (FX) reserves, acquired during surges in inflows, are sufficient to counter outflows due to rising US G- Sec rates, without having to raise domestic rates. Sale of FX stocks will release space on the RBI\u2019s balance sheet to buy more Indian government securities consistent with its target for creation of durable liquidity. RBI has the space to smooth volatility. 38. In view of expected growth and inflation trends in the context of continued Covid-19 related stresses, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and the stance accommodative. Greater uncertainties require more flexibility for the MPC. Therefore, I also support a move from time-based to data-based guidance with the understanding that in view of the unprecedented situation, supporting a full recovery is paramount. 39. The economic recovery after the pandemic shock of 2020 remains uneven and incomplete, and the renewed jump in COVID-19 infections in certain parts of the country has increased the downside risk to the growth momentum. On the other hand, inflation rates have been consistently well above the mid point of the target zone and is forecast to remain elevated for some time. This is a difficult situation, but I believe that the balance of risk and reward is in favour of monetary accommodation. Therefore, I support maintaining the policy rate at its current level, and I also support the accommodative stance. 40. The question that remains is about the time based forward guidance (first provided in October 2020) that is expiring now as we have already entered the new financial year. From my perspective, the principal motivation for the forward guidance was to reduce long term yields in the backdrop of an excessively steep yield curve. Unfortunately, forward guidance has failed to flatten the yield curve, and I see little merit in persisting with it any more. As the popular quote (often misattributed to Albert Einstein) says: insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. A flattening of the yield curve remains an important goal but, I think it must be pursued using other instruments which largely lie outside the remit of the MPC. 41. There is another reason why time based forward guidance is no longer appropriate. Experience of the last several months indicates that in the aftermath of the pandemic, forecasting has become more difficult. It is apparent that some economic and statistical relationships have tended to break down in the current exceptional environment. Consequently, model risk has now become an important issue as evidenced both in large realized forecast errors and in the dispersion of forecasts from different models. Model risk presents a far less tractable problem than the well defined statistical prediction error of any single model. In this situation, I think it is not prudent to repose excessive faith in forecasts. Instead, the MPC must have the agility and flexibility to respond rapidly and adequately to whatever surprises new data may bring in future. Time based guidance is inconsistent with this imperative. 42. Both these considerations weigh in favour of state contingent guidance that reaffirms the MPC\u2019s commitment to continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy so as to sustain growth on a durable basis while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Statement by Dr. Mridul K. Saggar 43. The Central Government, in consultation with the Bank, retained the inflation target and the tolerance bands for the next five years. At the outset, I wish to acknowledge this, both from the viewpoint of the sage counsel exercised and the accountability it imposes on the MPC going forward. Over the first five-year period of practicing inflation targeting, the headline inflation averaged 4.3 per cent compared with the situation when the CPI inflation was averaging around double digits for six years before this framework was conceived.1 The retention of the target will go a long way in preserving the macro-economic stability and the credibility of the framework. However, the success of this framework has not been unfettered. The volatility of inflation has remained high as manifested in higher coefficient of variation. However, this is largely reflection of supply disruptions during the pandemic period at a time where the growth collapse warranted monetary policy to prop up demand. Better supply management and greater recognition that growth-inflation trade-offs dissipate in long-run can help lower inflation volatility ahead. 44. Let me now turn to business at hand. The five significant differences since we last met in early February are: (i) the sudden resurgence of the Covid-19 infections; (ii) emergence of incipient signs that the recovery is beginning to lose some steam; (iii) return of inflation after a short-lived decline to the target; (iv) asset prices facing resistance after a runaway rally from the pandemic lows a year ago; (v) some indications of the path of fiscal consolidation going forward that still needs further clarity. The current account has also slipped back into a small deficit, but I will not judge this as material to our decision in this policy. Let me briefly discuss all of these. 45. After a remarkable decline in Covid-19 incidence during mid-September 2020 to mid- February 2021, daily new confirmed cases have spiked back to about 100 thousand. More than half of these new cases have come from Maharashtra that accounts for about 9.0 per cent of the country\u2019s population and 14.6 per cent of its output. The economic recovery can come under risk if this new wave of infections is not flattened soon. This is especially so as monetary and fiscal policies have already used most of their space to considerably limit loss of economic capital, though expansion of policy toolkits can still afford additional comfort. While the countrywide dispensation is still quite supportive of production activity, this can change if the virus spread, hitherto contained to few States, might transmit across country. Learning effects on calibrating stringency of restrictions may keep economic costs of the second wave much lower than the first but still retard full normalisation by a quarter or two. Ramping up vaccination, testing and treatment holds the key to protecting economic recovery and health policies have become the first line of defence. Monetary and fiscal policies can only play a second fiddle. Going forward, the GDP growth in Q4: 2020-21 is likely to surpass its implied growth in 46. the full year\u2019s NSO\u2019s Second Advance Estimates. The economy is then set for a growth rebound in 2021-22 with a baseline projection of 10.5 per cent; but this high growth will essentially be on account of an all-time low base. The realisation of the projected growth will translate to only a meagre average growth rate of 0.85 per cent in two years following 2019-20. This provides justification for the monetary policy\u2019s continued support to growth. Both consumption and investment need to be stimulated. Capacity utilisation rate at 66.6 per cent in the latest RBI survey is well below the long-term average of 73.6 per cent and though there is evidence of some small ticket investments reflected in pick up in short cycle capital goods, an upturn in capex cycle will require larger public investments that can crowd in private investments. Consumption needs support from removing credit frictions and more redistributive policies. Recovery is beginning to lose some steam. The IIP returned to the contraction zone in 47. January and will remain so in February. The output of the eight core industries, in February, 1 Headline inflation measured by All Groups combined CPI averaged 4.3 per cent for the period October 2016 to February 2021 (with March 2021 data awaited). The average excludes the two months \u2013 April and May 2020 \u2013 for which headline inflation was not computed and imputed back-prints were made available later. The annual average CPI-Industrial Workers inflation had touched double digits or stayed just underneath for the last six years 2008-09 to 2013-14, prompting Reserve Bank to revise and strengthen its monetary policy framework. registered its most negative growth since September 2020 and the largest month-on-month contraction since April 2020. However, this fall has been exacerbated by the month\u2019s peculiarity. But for the extra day in leap year 2020, the contraction would have been smaller with growth at (-)1.2 per cent instead of (-)4.6 per cent. Extrapolating February output for 31-days as in January, the month-on-month growth would have been (+)2.0 per cent instead of (-)7.8 per cent. The sequential improvement in high frequency indicators of real activity witnessed some loss of momentum in January with bulk of normalisation getting completed. In February, almost half of the indicators did not improve. This again may have lot to do with the peculiarity of the February month, but the second wave can entrench this trend. 48. Inflation rose back to 5.0 per cent in February after receding close to target at 4.1 per cent in January 2021. The momentum was somewhat above average, especially driven by core and fuel. Furthermore, the momentum in WPI was markedly above average. In each of the last four months, WPI prices have increased for larger number of commodities than ever in any of the months since October 2013. Therefore, momentum pressures for CPI may exacerbate in near term if producers hitherto absorbing a large part of cost push pressures decide to passthrough the price pressures to retail level. So far, this is not much seen in the CPI with lower-than-average CPI items witnessing price increases over last three months. Global commodity prices, both energy and non-energy, have surged since June 2020. The increases have been marked in case of crude oil, metals and food. The FAO food price index is higher by 27.5 per cent, while that for edible oils by 89.4 per cent. Imported commodities have a weight of about 22 per cent in CPI. Some price pressures may arise as a rise in global non-food commodity prices by 10 per cent is expected to increase CPI core goods inflation up to 50 bps. However, the passthrough to headline inflation is low. Therefore, despite the emerging risks and price pressures it should be possible to keep inflation within the band. 49. Asset prices are seemingly facing resistance after a runaway rally from the pandemic lows a year ago. Mundell has just left us, but his legacy will continue to haunt monetary policy as it manages the impossible trinity through surges and stops of capital flows. During February and March, EM equities have weakened slightly as global bonds faced a sell-off with US 10-year yield hardening 67 basis points. Benchmark yields in most emerging markets rose more sharply over the same period but in India the rise was contained to 26 bps. Indian rupee till now has remained stable and bucked the global trend of depreciating EM currencies. There is risk in too much focus on asset prices in the conduct of monetary policy. Credit channel that works in tandem with interest rate channel is far more important than the asset price channel for effective monetary transmission. Countries have certainly relied on negative nominal or real rates in an attempt to avert deep recessions. In part they have helped limit job losses and scarring. However, these benefits have to be weighed against the low interest rates fuelling K-shaped recoveries with increased inequalities and inflicting financial repression for savers. Also, there are added macroeconomic risks for countries where inflation is not as dampened as in Advanced Economies that are resorting to unconventional policies. 50. It is equally important to understand that while increasing fiscal space to the extent possible is desirable, any revision in fiscal targets should be consistent with medium-term debt sustainability and should not impinge on conduct of monetary policy, such as requiring direct monetisation that has been eschewed even by countries with low inflation. Lastly, the current account deficit in small size as expected is least of a worry, but going forward, with wide fiscal gaps, large twin deficits must be avoided over the medium term. 51. While we had moved towards calibrated exit from extra-ordinary supportive measures to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 as the curve was flattening, we have already made considerable adjustments in exit dates for these measures. The extant priority is now to continue supporting growth from the possible shock from the second wave. I, therefore, vote for retaining the policy rate at present level and continue with the accommodative stance as spelled out in resolution. I borrow what Marie Curie said, \u201cNothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.\u201d It is in this spirit that we act appropriately as per judgment based on scientific facts. 52. articulated in the MPC\u2019s resolution. I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to maintain an accommodative stance as 53. Risks to the recovery have become accentuated since the MPC\u2019s February meeting \u2013 new waves of infections and the inexorably slow pace of vaccinations; moderation in several high frequency sentiment indicators; global risks and spillovers. Monetary policy has to remain supportive of the economy until the recovery is more sure footed and its sustainability assured. Meanwhile, inflation middled the tolerance band in December and January and aligned with the target; although it has risen in February, it is expected to remain within the corridor over a 12- month horizon. Longer term inflation expectations remain broadly stable in spite of high volatility in food and fuel prices. Demand pull is still weak. The inflation print of February reflects pandemic effects in the form of input cost pressures \u2013 though still muted in translating into selling prices \u2013 retail margins and increased costs of doing business as supply chains are still mending. Accordingly, I would continue to look through the recent elevation in inflation and remain focused on reviving the economy on a path of strong and sustainable growth. An integral part of this approach would be to insulate domestic financial markets from global spillovers and volatility so that congenial financial conditions continue to support growth. Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 54. Economic activity and inflation developments over the past two months have been largely along the anticipated lines. The curve of active cases of COVID-19, which was on a downward trend till mid-February, has changed its course with a surge in several parts of the country. Experience of other countries suggest that this new surge can be more infectious due to several mutations of the virus. Rapidly rising cases of COVID-19 is the single biggest challenge to ongoing recovery in the Indian economy. Learnings of last one year should, however, help us in managing the crisis as it unfolds. 55. Global growth is gradually recovering, even though it remains uneven across countries, reflecting the substantial differences in the infections trajectory, the speed of vaccination drives, and the size of fiscal stimulus. International organisations are gradually scaling up their global growth outlook for 2021. The improving global outlook would support India\u2019s exports and investment demand. At the same time, global financial markets have turned volatile over inflation fears in advanced economies and rising commodity prices, posing risks to the domestic outlook. 56. In the domestic economy, there are clear signs of revival of growth. The agricultural sector has been resilient throughout the pandemic period. Manufacturing and services activities continue to normalise as reflected in key high frequency indicators such as mobility data; issuance of e- way bills; GST revenue; wholesale dispatches of automobile; registrations of passenger vehicles and construction equipment vehicles; rail and water cargo; highway toll collections; and electricity generation. These indicators represent a wide range of sectors that are maintaining their pace, which we had noticed in the previous round of MPC deliberations as well. While there was a slight dip in industrial production during January, PMI manufacturing remained resilient. Manufacturing companies assessed further strengthening of production, order books and employment during Q4:2020-21 according to a survey conducted by the RBI. Forward looking surveys suggest further improvement in production and overall business situation during 2021-22. Capacity utilisation of the manufacturing sector recovered further. 57. A revival in real estate and residential construction activity also seems to be underway as reflected in stamp and registration duty collections in select states in February 2021, backed by lower cost of financing, stable prices and support from the Government. This, coupled with higher financial savings, show that the aggregate balance sheet of the household sector \u2013 the resource surplus sector of the economy \u2013 could provide support to demand recovery. Signs of incipient revival in domestic demand were discernible in the current account balance which swung into deficit in Q3:2020-21 after reporting surplus for three consecutive quarters. India\u2019s exports and imports have attained their pre-pandemic levels in Q4:2020-21. Foreign direct investment flows have been running higher than the previous year. While strong domestic fundamentals and healthy level of foreign exchange reserves shall bode well for the external sector, the speed of domestic vaccination drive will be key in containing short-term risks to domestic economic recovery and mitigating spillovers from global shocks. All these indicators suggest that the real GDP is evolving on the lines of the February 58. MPC resolution. Improving demand conditions, investment enhancing measures by the Government and improving external demand impart an upside to growth prospects. The recent jump in COVID-19 infections and its impact on economic activity, however, needs to be watched carefully. 59. Headline inflation registered significant softening in January 2021 to move close to the target rate from levels that were substantially above the upper tolerance threshold. A sharp correction in food inflation helped to bring about this rapid disinflation. In February, however, headline inflation increased to 5.0 per cent from 4.1 per cent in January, primarily due to volatility imparted by adverse base effects. On the other hand, core inflation remained elevated. Going ahead, sustenance of key factors like the bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21; mitigation of price pressures through timely supply-side measures on key food items such as pulses and edible oils; and coordinated reduction in taxes on petroleum products by centre and states can help assuage cost pressures on inflation. On the other hand, a combination of high international commodity prices and logistics costs may push up input price pressures across manufacturing and services. The projection of inflation rate at 5 per cent for the full year 2021-22, with 5.2 per cent for the first half and 4.8 per cent for the second half, takes into account both the upside and the downside pressures. 60. The April 2021 MPC meeting was the first after the Government notification of March 31, 2021 retaining the inflation target at 4 per cent with the lower and the upper tolerance levels of 2 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, for the next five years (April 2021-March 2026). The successful implementation of the flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework since 2016 has resulted in better anchoring of inflation expectations, especially those of financial market participants, around the 4 per cent target rate. It has also improved transparency of monetary policy process. The resultant increase in monetary policy credibility has helped the MPC to respond effectively to the growth-inflation trade-offs posed by an exceptional shock like the COVID-19. In the recent period, the RBI\u2019s policy strategy has been a combination of liquidity 61. operations, support to targeted sectors, credible communication and explicit forward guidance. In sync with the MPC\u2019s accommodative stance guidance, the RBI maintained ample surplus liquidity through conventional as well as unconventional measures which have helped to ease domestic financial conditions; reduce borrowing costs; improve transmission; and facilitate the successful completion of central and state government borrowing programmes in 2020-21. It has also led to significant amount of private borrowing through corporate bonds, commercial paper and debentures. As part of the liquidity management strategy for 2021-22, the Reserve Bank\u2019s objective would be to ensure orderly evolution of the yield curve and to avoid volatility in G-sec market. This would help create pre-conditions in financial markets that support a durable economic recovery. The secondary market G-sec acquisition programme or G-SAP 1.0, where the RBI has committed upfront a specific amount of open market purchases of government securities is a step in this direction to ensure congenial financial conditions for the recovery to gain traction. Going forward, the RBI would continue to ensure ample surplus systemic liquidity and the system would remain in surplus even after meeting the requirements of all financial market segments and the productive sectors of the economy. The MPC\u2019s forward guidance over the past year has been helpful in anchoring market 62. expectations; navigating the recovery from the crisis; and strengthening the pace of monetary transmission. The forward guidance provided by the MPC \u2013 to remain in accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis \u2013 lays out the future course of monetary policy. Given the uncertainties and the fact that we are in the beginning of a new financial year, it is too early to give explicit time-based forward guidance. The forward guidance in terms of securing a sustainable growth on a durable basis itself testifies to our commitment to continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target, going forward. 63. The need of the hour is to effectively secure the economic recovery underway so that it becomes broad-based and durable. The renewed jump in COVID-19 infections in several parts of the country and the associated localised and regional lockdowns add uncertainty to the growth outlook. In such an environment, monetary policy should remain accommodative to support, nurture and consolidate the recovery. We need to continue to sustain the impulses of growth in the new financial year 2021-22. I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The RBI would take all steps, as needed, to ensure orderly conditions in the financial markets and to preserve financial stability. ", "June_2021": "The twenty ninth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, was held from June 2 to 4, 2021. 2. The meeting was attended by all the members \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Senior Advisor, National Council of Applied Economic Research, Delhi; Dr. Ashima Goyal, Professor, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai; Prof. Jayanth R. Varma, Professor, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Executive Director (the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB(2)(c) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934); Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy \u2013 and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor. Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal and Prof. Jayanth R. Varma joined the meeting through video conference. 3. According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, the Reserve Bank shall publish, on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following, namely: (a) the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee; (b) the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee, ascribed to such member, on the resolution adopted in the said meeting; and of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting. The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer 4. confidence, households\u2019 inflation expectations, corporate sector performance, credit conditions, the outlook for the industrial, services and infrastructure sectors, and the projections of professional forecasters. The MPC also reviewed in detail staff\u2019s macroeconomic projections, and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook. Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy, the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below. 5. Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (June 4, 2021) decided to: On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. 6. Since the MPC\u2019s meeting in April, the global economic recovery has been gaining momentum, driven mainly by major advanced economies (AEs) and powered by massive vaccination programmes and stimulus packages. Activity remains uneven in major emerging market economies (EMEs), with downside risks from renewed waves of infections due to contagious mutants of the virus and the relatively slow progress in vaccination. World merchandise trade continues to recover as external demand resumes, though elevated freight rates and container dislocations are emerging as constraints. CPI inflation is firming up in most AEs, driven by release of pent-up demand, elevated input prices and unfavourable base effects. Inflation in major EMEs has been generally close to or above official targets in recent months, pushed up by the sustained rise in global food and commodity prices. Global financial conditions remain benign. Domestic Economy 7. Turning to the domestic economy, provisional estimates of national income released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on May 31, 2021 placed India\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) contraction at 7.3 per cent for 2020-21, with GDP growth in Q4 at 1.6 per cent year-on- year (y-o-y). On June 1, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast a normal south- west monsoon, with rainfall at 101 per cent of the long period average (LPA). This augurs well for agriculture. With the rise in infections in rural areas, however, indicators of rural demand \u2013 tractor sales and two-wheeler sales \u2013 posted sequential declines during April. 8. Industrial production registered a broad-based improvement in March 2021. While mining and electricity output surpassed March 2019 (pre-pandemic) levels, manufacturing did not catch up. The output of core industries registered a double digit y-o-y growth in April 2021, propelled by a weak base. Although GST collections were at their highest during April 2021, there are indications of moderation in May as reflected in lower E-way bills generation. Other high- frequency indicators \u2013 electricity generation; railway freight traffic; port cargo; steel consumption; cement production; and toll collections \u2013 recorded sequential moderation during April-May 2021, reflecting the impact of restrictions and localised lockdowns imposed by states with exemptions 2 for specific activities. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) remained in expansion in May although it moderated to 50.8 from 55.5 in April due to a slowdown in output and new orders. The services PMI, which was 54.0 in April, entered into contraction (46.4) in May, after seven months of sustained expansion. 9. Headline inflation registered a moderation to 4.3 per cent in April from 5.5 per cent in March, largely on favourable base effects. Food inflation fell to 2.7 per cent in April from 5.2 per cent in March, with prices of cereals, vegetables and sugar continuing to decline on a y-o-y basis. While fuel inflation surged, core (CPI excluding food and fuel) inflation moderated in April across most sub-groups barring housing and health, mainly due to base effects. Inflation in transport and communication remained in double digits. 10. System liquidity remained in large surplus in April and May 2021, with average daily net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) amounting to \u20b95.2 lakh crore. Reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 12.4 per cent (y-o-y) on May 28, 2021, driven by currency demand. Money supply (M3) and bank credit grew by 9.9 per cent and 6.0 per cent, respectively, as on May 21, 2021 as compared with growth of 11.7 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively, a year ago. India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 21.2 billion in 2021-22 (up to May 28) to US$ 598.2 billion. Outlook 11. Going forward, the inflation trajectory is likely to be shaped by uncertainties impinging on the upside and the downside. The rising trajectory of international commodity prices, especially of crude, together with logistics costs, pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. Excise duties, cess and taxes imposed by the Centre and States need to be adjusted in a coordinated manner to contain input cost pressures emanating from petrol and diesel prices. A normal south-west monsoon along with comfortable buffer stocks should help to keep cereal price pressures in check. Recent supply side interventions are expected to ameliorate the tightness in the pulses market. Further supply side measures are needed to soften pressures on pulses and edible oil prices. With declining infections, restrictions and localised lockdowns across states could ease gradually and mitigate disruptions to supply chains, reducing cost pressures. Weak demand conditions may also temper the pass-through to core inflation. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI inflation is projected at 5.1 per cent during 2021-22: 5.2 per cent in Q1; 5.4 per cent in Q2; 4.7 per cent in Q3; and 5.3 per cent in Q4:2021-22; with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, rural demand remains strong and the expected normal 12. monsoon bodes well for sustaining its buoyancy, going forward. The increased spread of COVID- 19 infections in rural areas, however, poses downside risks. Urban demand has been dented by the second wave, but adoption of new COVID-compatible occupational models by businesses for an appropriate working environment may cushion the hit to economic activity, especially in manufacturing and services sectors that are not contact intensive. On the other hand, the strengthening global recovery should support the export sector. Domestic monetary and financial conditions remain highly accommodative and supportive of economic activity. Moreover, the vaccination process is expected to gather steam in the coming months and should help to normalise economic activity quickly. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is now projected at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22, consisting of 18.5 per cent in Q1; 7.9 per cent in Q2; 7.2 per cent in Q3; and 6.6 per cent in Q4:2021-22 (Chart 2). 13. The MPC notes that the second wave of COVID-19 has altered the near-term outlook, necessitating urgent policy interventions, active monitoring and further timely measures to prevent emergence of supply chain bottlenecks and build-up of retail margins. A hastened pace of the vaccination drive and quick ramping up of healthcare infrastructure across both urban and rural areas are critical to preserve lives and livelihoods and prevent a resurgence in new waves of infections. At this juncture, policy support from all sides \u2013 fiscal, monetary and sectoral \u2013 is required to nurture recovery and expedite return to normalcy. Accordingly, the MPC decided to retain the prevailing repo rate at 4 per cent and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. All members of the MPC \u2013 Dr. Shashanka Bhide, Dr. Ashima Goyal, Prof. Jayanth R. 14. Varma, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das \u2013 unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Furthermore, all members of the MPC unanimously voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The minutes of the MPC\u2019s meeting will be published on June 18, 2021. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during August 4 to 6, 2021. Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent The strong recovery in economic activities registered in Q4: FY2021 raised expectations 17. that the adverse impact of the Covid 19 pandemic is now behind us. The Provisional Estimates brought out by National Statistics Office (NSO) for 2020-21 on May 31 now place the real GDP growth at -7.3 per cent over the previous year, a lower rate of contraction than provided in the Second Advance Estimates. The year-on-year growth rates of key components of aggregate demand, Private Final Consumption and Government Final Consumption Expenditures, Exports and Gross Fixed Capital Formation registered substantial recovery in Q4 compared to the performance in the previous quarter. On the production side, construction sector registered double digit growth rate, year-on-year, in Q4. Data available on the performance of the corporate sector in Q4: FY2021 also shows improvement in sales realisations and Gross Value Added, particularly in the case of manufacturing sector. However, the subsequent second steep surge of the Covid 19 infections seen during April-May, led to far greater fatalities than in the previous wave and some disruptions of economic activities in the first two months of Q1: FY2022, which in turn have required re-assessment of the growth prospects in the immediate term. The second wave of infections led to restrictions on the movement of people at a local level 18. unlike the national level lockdown imposed during the first wave in 2020. But the fact that extent of the spread of the disease was large in many of the large cities also meant that commercial activities were disrupted in a significant manner. The rural areas were not insulated from the second wave to the extent it was the case during the first wave. 19. While data on the impact of the second wave of the pandemic is limited, qualitative data emerging from the surveys of households and enterprises suggest significant dent in the consumer and business sentiments. The survey of Consumer Confidence conducted by RBI in the last week of April and up to May 10, 2021 in 13 major cities in the country reveals a sharp rise in the percentage of respondents who perceive the current general economic conditions to be worse than a year back, compared to a similar survey conducted two months back. Importantly, 51.5 per cent of the respondents also say that they believe the general economic conditions would be worse a year-ahead. Early results of the quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey of the RBI for June 2021, show that in the case of the manufacturing sector, the summary index of current business conditions has declined for Q1: FY2022 and the index of expectations also has declined for Q2: FY 2022. These perceptions of business conditions point to the adverse economic conditions compared to the sentiments at the end of Q4: FY2021. 5 20. Further evolution of the economy would be affected by the decline in the spread of the disease on the back of adoption Covid appropriate behaviour by the population that increases protection from new infections. Acceleration in the vaccination program and availability of health care would be a key to boost the confidence of the consumers, workers and producers in the resumption of their economic lives. The projection of near-term economic growth, therefore, is conditioned by this unexpected shock from the second wave of the pandemic. 21. The global economic conditions in 2021 have been projected to be more favourable to trade and investment than in 2020, as the Advanced Economies are expected to regain the growth momentum. The Covid 19 pandemic is seen to be coming under control combined with fiscal stimulus measures to revive demand. However, the shadow of threat of the new strains of the virus and the slow progress of vaccinations globally will also limit the economic revival. 22. The initial impact of the second wave of the pandemic on the economy has been incorporated in the revised assessment of the GDP growth for FY2022 by many organisations and agencies. The median estimate of GDP growth for FY2022 from RBI\u2019s Survey of Professional Forecasters carried out during May 2021 has declined to 9.8 per cent over the previous year from 11.0 per cent forecast in March 2021. 23. While the uncertainty over the short-term growth prospects has increased, there are also the positive triggers. The improved global demand conditions are expected to support the sustained improvement in export performance. The focus on improving capital expenditure in the central government budget also provides a stimulus to domestic demand. Agriculture is expected to contribute to economic growth based on a favourable monsoon. Response to these triggers by improvement in private consumption and investment spending will require the sustained reduction in the Covid 19 infections. 24. In this backdrop the projected growth of GDP in 2021-22 at 9.5 per cent, revised downward from the 10.5 per cent, projected in April 2021 will require continued fiscal and monetary policy support, besides other measures to enable expansion of economic activities and keeping the population safe from the pandemic. 25. The headline inflation rate for April 2021 is at 4.3 per cent, although fuel price index rose sharply by 7.9 per cent, year on year basis. The index of prices reflecting core inflation (excluding food and fuel) \u2013 which includes the effect of food and fuel prices indirectly through input linkages and that of transportation prices directly - increased by 5.4 per cent in April compared to 5.9 per cent in March 2021. The rising prices of fuel and global commodity prices push up the cost of production and distribution across supply chains. Besides the resumption of production across sectors that also create competitive pressures, easing of these price pressures will require more efficient operation of trade and logistics infrastructure, supported by easing of movement restrictions. Based on present trends, the projected headline inflation rate in 2021-22 at 5.1 per cent, is marginally higher than the projections in April 2021. At this juncture, providing a policy environment supportive of sustained economic 26. recovery from the second shock of the pandemic is necessary. I vote in favour of keeping the policy repo rate unchanged at 4.0 per cent. I also vote in 27. favour of continuing with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. 28. The human cost is incalculable in the country\u2019s battle with the fearsome second wave of more infectious coronavirus variants. The economic cost, however, is likely to be limited. Compared to last year, the fall in demand far exceeds that in supply because of the decentralized structure of lockdowns that largely maintained inter-state goods movement and make possible calibrated, differentiated re-opening. Since vaccination in hot spots such as large cities and for corporates is likely to reach a critical mass by July-August normalization will be rapid. Although uncertainties remain regarding a possible third wave, vaccination cover in dense clusters will reduce its probability. The second wave peak in rural areas was in the slack season and is past. Sowing is likely to be normal with a good monsoon. Migrant labour is also available for work. 29. There are two major implications for monetary policy. First, since the fall in demand exceeds that in supply the output gap should widen, reducing demand side pressures on inflation. Second, a healthier supply-side combined with weak demand may damp firms pricing power and pass through, despite more concentration that increases it. In the past quarters output prices have risen with input prices and together with global commodity price rise and a low base, pushed WPI inflation into double digits. Firms have actually raised profit margins, even in a pandemic year. This may be partly due to low capacity utilization. They have not passed on a fall in wages and many other costs such as travel. Moreover, since normally the pass through from WPI to CPI headline is low and lagged, wage increases may remain muted, preventing persistent second round rise in inflation. The dominant current view is global price pressures are temporary and expected to reduce as supply chain disruptions and congestion are overcome. Moreover, uneven global recovery and uncertainties may somewhat restrain demand, despite the unprecedented stimulus given in a few major countries. Headline CPI, therefore, is widely predicted to remain within the MPC\u2019s tolerance band, although seasonal and lockdown related spikes may occur. 30. But can the rise in household inflation expectations compared to March create persistence in inflation? Note, however, current surveys were conducted over 29th April to 11th May. Fresh coronavirus cases peaked at above 4 lakhs on 7th May. This was the period of highest fear and uncertainty that very likely affected consumer responses. A number of inconsistencies in responses also support this hypothesis. For example, inflation is expected to soften for all non-food groups, but is expected to increase in the aggregate. In the consumer confidence survey inflation is expected to reduce, albeit the level remains high. Therefore, robust inferences have to await surveys taken in more normal times. 31. The slump in consumer confidence in the second wave is slightly more than that in the first wave. It had, however, recovered to July 2019 levels in January 2021, and may show a similar V- shape this time. It is not yet clear if higher risk-aversion will dampen consumer demand more now or there will again be a desire to make up for forced abstention. But income and job loss, more indebtedness and impoverishment surely will shrink demand. 32. The MPC has moved to data-based guidance from time-based guidance. In times of such uncertainty, expectations and forecasts are less reliable. It is important, therefore, while remaining pre-emptive and forward looking, to wait for data on actual outcomes, watching for first signs of second round pass through in inflation as well as for alleviation on the supply-side. Over-reaction has to be avoided to minimize risks if expectations prove incorrect. Adjustment, therefore, has to be gradual but not too gradual as monetary policy acts with long lags. 33. At this juncture, since the output gap has widened and inflation is largely predicted to remain within the tolerance band, macroeconomic policy clearly has to further stimulate demand. The short-term real interest, however, is already negative and may be close to equilibrium levels, so it is liquidity that has to make additional contributions. Targeted schemes can smooth kinks in the yield curve ensuring that funds reach wherever required. Low demand is keeping credit growth low, with the excess durable liquidity parked by banks in the reverse repo so that broad money supply growth remains low at 9.9 per cent. The risk of excess money growth fuelling inflation is therefore minor as yet. 34. In the circumstances, I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and the stance accommodative as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while remaining watchful to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward. There is room for a supportive limited countercyclical rise in government deficits. This 35. together with visibly better tax performance will prevent spikes in risk premium and help monetary policy keep real interest rates at levels that sustain the growth recovery. Growth rates that exceed the real interest rate bring down debt ratios over time1. 36. Recovering global growth has buoyed Indian exports supporting demand. But the asymmetric global recovery carries a potential threat of a recurrence of the taper tantrum. The beginnings of US exit from stimulus may provoke outflows from emerging markets. But India has the reserves to suit its interest rate policy to its domestic cycle instead of being forced to follow the US cycle. Moreover, at present there is some softening of US bond yields and the dollar is weakening, suggesting the exit may be smooth. A rise in inflation above the 2 per cent Fed target for a few months is unlikely to destabilize long run inflation expectations if inflation ruling below 2 per cent for many years after the global financial crisis could not do so. Moreover, there is the post taper learning that bond markets are less destabilized during exit if the Fed\u2019s balance sheet is allowed to shrink very slowly as securities mature, while interest rates are raised only gradually with data that shows the recovery to be well established. Statement by Prof. Jayanth R. Varma 37. The economic recovery that was visible in the early months of 2021 was arrested by the second wave of the pandemic which has been catastrophic in terms of lives lost. But the economic impact appears to have been less severe, and high frequency indicators provide some reason to hope that the economic recovery will resume soon as the second wave now appears to be well past its peak. However, ever since the onset of the pandemic, nowcasts and forecasts of economic growth have not been highly reliable. Moreover, there is a fear that the health shock is inducing high levels of precautionary savings that could depress demand for several quarters to come. All of this point to a need for monetary accommodation at this juncture to support economic recovery. 38. Turning to inflation, Indian inflation rates have been consistently well above the mid point of the tolerance zone for an extended period and are forecast to remain elevated for some time. Moreover, survey data and other indicators show that businesses have no difficulty in passing on cost increases to consumers, and are able to maintain (and even expand) their margins. The only source of comfort is that all the evidence at the moment suggests that inflation is being driven not by domestic demand, but by supply side factors including the global surge in commodity prices. 1 See Goyal, A. 2021. Using the snowball effect in Indian post Covid-19 paths to fiscal consolidation. IGIDR Working paper no. WP-2021-016. Available at: http://www.igidr.ac.in/pdf/publication/WP-2021-016.pdf. This could change as the recovery gathers steam, and the MPC must be sensitive to the risk that inflation expectations could become entrenched if inflation remains elevated for too long. The MPC has been able to maintain monetary accommodation in the face of above-target inflation mainly because of its hard-earned credibility for successful inflation targeting. To maintain and enhance this credibility, the MPC needs to remain data driven so that it can respond rapidly and adequately to any unforeseen shocks that may arise in future. 39. Turning to the current policy statement, I believe that the balance of risk and reward continues to be in favour of monetary accommodation. Therefore, I support maintaining the policy rate at its current level, and I also support the accommodative stance. 40. offs in the backdrop of decision at hand. Let me provide an assessment of growth and inflation before discussing some policy trade- 41. After a spike, daily new infections are now back at the levels that prevailed at the time of the last MPC meeting. Judging by the epidemiological models the wave will be flattened by end- June. Economic recovery is likely to ensue. With unclear probabilities and timings of any further waves, they are best kept as a risk factor rather than a baseline assumption. 42. The solace is that growth has not fallen off the cliff in Q1 as it did a year ago. Work-related Google and Apple mobility indicators, GST E-way bills issuances and wholesale and retail digital payments, despite sequential drops, have stayed much higher on a year-on-year basis than last year. This lends support to the Q1 growth projection that implies a smaller quarter-over-quarter decline of 18.0 per cent compared with 29.7 per cent a year ago. It is possible that that initial GDP estimates do not provide full visibility and the impact on informal and unorganised economy may be deeper. Also, if the economy does expand by 9.5 per cent this year, the output level in 2021-22 will be just 1.6 per cent higher than in the pre-pandemic year 2019-20. These are two reasons against pulling out policy support to growth prematurely. However, while monetary and fiscal policies can lend counter-cyclical support, a sustained revival will ultimately depend on health policies and how the limited fiscal space is used to augment potential output by tagging spending to capex and structural reforms. 43. World economy is picking steam and global growth beyond 6 per cent is possible powered by the strong bounce back in the U.S. and steady acceleration in the euro area. If the expected slowdown in China in the sequential quarters is arrested through policy interventions the global growth momentum can turn breathtaking. However, this would also carry the risk of increased passthrough from global inflation. Upside on net exports may also be limited by worldwide container shortages, though some moderation in capesize freight rates in May shows that efforts to decongest ports are working. Government directly produces about a fifth of the GDP and its\u2019 spending will matter for growth. This year\u2019s budget aims to shift spending further from consumption to investment. This augurs well for growth from a multi-year perspective given its much higher multiplier. Lastly, monsoon forecast at 101\u00b14% of LPA, with a reasonably good spatial and temporal distribution, has diminished the downside risks though a clearer picture will be known only by the next MPC meeting in August. 44. Coming to inflation, the baseline suggests that inflation will stay within the tolerance band, though consistently above target. It may remain close to the upper tolerance level till August but recede thereafter if Kharif crop shapes well and if global commodity price pressures subside by then. Risks of elongated commodity pressures exist in face of piping-hot global economy but demand substitution across commodities supported by the ESG push might change relative prices thus halting or reversing the rising prices of crude oil, iron ore and steel. While prices of crude oil, pulses, edible oils and cotton are likely to put pressure on domestic inflation they can be contained by quick fiscal or supply-side responses. 45. Let me come to some policy trade-offs we face. First, as a baseline, inflation is expected to stay elevated from the target but below the upper tolerance level through the year. However, the probability distribution indicated in the fan chart shows that risks of breaching the upper tolerance level are not insignificant. But for the extra-ordinary circumstances that prevail, we would have moved to a neutral stance long back. I had earlier in my statements starting October 2020 stated that output gap will close towards the end of 2021-22. The second wave is likely to push back normalisation a bit but not a lot. A range of filtering techniques still suggest closure of output gap as a ratio of level of potential GDP by the end of this year but we cannot rely on them mechanically as these techniques have high dependence on the end points. Therefore, we need to make some allowance for the uncertainty around that. We can continue to support growth for now as the flexible inflation targeting framework allows temporary deviation from the target so long as inflation is expected to be within tolerance bands. There are risks to inflation as there have been general price pressures at the WPI level and its inflation as well as its momentum is at its highest for the index with the current base. However, the passthrough of cost-push inflation at the retail level has stayed muted amid demand deficiency. Also, credit growth remains anaemic and nominal broad money growth as well as money multiplier adjusted for reverse repo remain low. So, support to growth can continue at this juncture. In my view, clear signs of generalisation in CPI inflation setting in could be a tipping point where growth-inflation dynamics could alter. Also, with a further rise in elevated inflation expectations, policy may need to respond if these expectations are becoming unhinged. While the odds are that we can avert this as inflation softens back in H2, the uncertainties ahead provide a rationale to avert any time-based guidance, especially as transmission lags exist. 46. Secondly, we need to consider the policy trade-off between leaving policy rate unchanged and correcting it at some point for the negative real rates that have persisted for a spectrum of interest rates thus taxing savers. The frontier of the macroeconomics, especially in terms of Heterogenous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) models provide a good reason to think that not all savers may necessarily be worse off when central banks push down the interest rates. These models capture additional effects that are heterogenous. As demand increases with monetary expansion, firms ramp up production. This improves their survival rate amid a deep shock like the pandemic. It also protects job losses and pushes more wages and salaries in the hands of households most of whom may get more than compensated for a drop in their interest incomes on saving. With a large proportion of low income and other liquidity constrained households in India, these indirect second-round effects could turn very significant. Furthermore, low interest rates create space for fiscal action in support of growth. These multiplier effects are the raison d\u2019etre for extant monetary and liquidity accommodation. My judgment is that the policy has worked well in dampening scarring, limiting job losses, generating wealth effects from higher asset prices, thus supporting incomes and consumption under some very difficult circumstances. Its continuation for long, though carries the hazard of unintended consequences as incomes may instead fall in real terms worsening its distribution as well. Monetary accommodation, when coordinated with expansionary fiscal policy has a greater impact on output gap but may also cause slope of the Phillips curve to turn steeper over time. 10 47. Nevertheless, retail inflation is not yet predominantly demand-driven and to accept output sacrifice at this stage may not be the best policy choice. Taking full cognisance of these policy trade-offs, I judge that withdrawing support to growth at this stage may be premature as it may dampen second-round effects. I, therefore, vote for retaining the policy rate at present level and continue with the stance as spelled out in resolution. I vote to maintain status quo on the policy rate and on the stance of policy. The growth-inflation trade-off and consequently, policy choices have shifted towards 49. increasing accommodation. High frequency indicators for April and May 2021 point to a stalling of the recovery that was underway from the second half of 2020-21. Unlike in the first wave, supply conditions have remained relatively resilient in the second wave, but aggregate demand barring net exports has been dented and needs counter-pandemic policy support. Even the turnaround in net exports is fragile and heavily dependent on the strength of the vaccination- propelled revival in external demand, which may be partially offset by the terms of trade loss on account of the rise in international commodity prices, particularly crude oil. 50. April\u2019s inflation afforded a window of respite, and more recent information suggests that price pressures on some constituents of the food category may remain benign in the near-term in spite of the usual pre-monsoon upturn. Input pressures will work towards keeping core inflation elevated, while some food prices will reflect persisting demand-supply imbalances, but in the absence of strong demand, the pass-through to retail inflation is likely to be incomplete and delayed, especially with respect to prices of services. The outlook for energy inflation is the main upside risk, especially as the timing and magnitude of reflation of global demand to pre-pandemic levels is uncertain. This warrants close and continuous watching, with preparedness to take countervailing action in the form of duty/tax reductions. The recent initiative of a Group of Ministers monitoring supply conditions with greater intensity is a welcome step in the right direction and should be matched by proactive actions as necessary to deflect imported input costs from adding to inflationary pressures. The MPC has created the necessary conditions for supporting growth by maintaining the 51. policy rate at its lowest level ever. It has also provided credible forward guidance matched by actions, committing to a path for future short-term interest rates that should re-engineer the recovery that was dented by the impact of the second wave of COVID-19, given the limited headroom from inflation remaining aligned with the target in April and forecast to stay within the tolerance band going forward. The onus is on the Reserve Bank to operationalize the MPC\u2019s guidance on an ongoing basis by ensuring congenial financial conditions across the system as well as for specific sectors, instruments and institutions. With credit growth remaining subdued despite monetary transmission being reasonably full, the Reserve Bank is galvanising market-based channels of financing as well as off-market channels such as refinancing institutions. It is also proactively engaged in operations that convey the monetary policy stance directly across the term structure of interest rates. By keeping the policy rate unchanged and by persevering with the accommodative stance in this meeting, the MPC creates the space for further easing of financial conditions by the Reserve Bank. 52. When we last met in early April, the second wave of COVID-19 infections had started increasing but was still restricted to a few states. In the subsequent weeks, however, the surge in new infections turned severe and broad-based both in its spread across states and in the intensity of the increase, putting enormous pressure on the health system with heavy toll on human lives. The lockdown restrictions and containment measures undertaken by the states have led to a significant moderation of new infections and active cases; at the same time, it has taken some toll on the economy, as reflected in high-frequency economic and mobility indicators. We have now started seeing a phased relaxation of the restrictions in some states and can expect activity across the country to normalise from the beginning of July, if this trend persists. 53. The indicators of rural as well as urban demand suggest that economic activity was normalising and gaining a strong foothold in Q4:2020-21 with broad-based recovery driven by revival in real estate, manufacturing, construction and trade and financial services. With decline in infections, there were nascent signs of revival in the capex cycle during Q4:2020-21 as reflected in indicators like steel consumption; cement production; imports and production of capital goods. The recovery also got reflected in the strong print of the real gross value added (GVA) growth for the same quarter. This momentum in activity got abruptly disrupted with the onset of the second wave. 54. The infection containment efforts this time around were localised and calibrated, which allowed manufacturing and industrial activity to operate in varying degrees across states during this period. At the same time, businesses and supply chains have increasingly adapted to working in the pandemic and restricted environment. Also, the reverse migration of labour to villages has been muted relative to last year and inter-state movement of goods continues smoothly. Overall, it is expected that the loss in momentum of activity could be temporary and restricted to the first quarter of 2021-22. 55. Going forward, agriculture is expected to be the bright spot in the current year as well after remaining the fulcrum of growth during 2020-21. The upward revision of monsoon forecast with good spatial distribution augurs well for this expectation. Further, exports have exhibited resilience in recent months and with global recovery strengthening, especially in India\u2019s key export destinations, it is anticipated that net exports would remain a propellant of growth in the current year. Enhanced and targeted policy support to exports can buttress this process further. The central government capex, which is budgeted to expand at a robust pace for 2021-22 (overall capital expenditure is budgeted to increase by 30.5 per cent within which capital outlay is budgeted to increase by 63.4 per cent) along with infrastructure pipeline, should reignite investment cycle once restrictions are eased. As the vaccination coverage expands, the pent-up demand for contact- intensive services is likely to rebound sharply. They should also get a leg up from the on-tap liquidity window from the Reserve Bank for these sectors. Domestic monetary and financial conditions remain highly accommodative and are expected to continue to be so in view of the MPC\u2019s forward guidance. Taking all these factors into account, economic activity can be expected to recover from Q2:2021-22 onwards and gather pace in H2:2021-22 (October-March). For the full year, however, with the dent in activity during Q1:2021-22, the projected growth for 2021-22 is 9.5 per cent instead of 10.5 per cent projected earlier. 12 provides some relief and policy space enabling the Reserve Bank to step up liquidity infusion into the system to provide further support to the weak domestic economy in line with the MPC\u2019s stance of reviving and sustaining growth on a durable basis. Moreover, the fragile demand conditions could help limit the pass-through of input cost pressures across manufacturing and services to output prices. Going forward, CPI inflation for 2021-22 is projected to be at 5.1 per cent, which is well within the mandated tolerance band of 2-6 per cent; however, we would need to keep a close watch on the evolving trajectory considering the uncertainties, both on the upside and downside, to the baseline path. Given the predominant role of supply side factors in the recent inflation movements, active and timely supply side policy measures with regard to petrol and diesel, edible oil and pulses, among others, would be critical to bring about a durable softening of price pressures. 57. Overall, the second wave of COVID-19 has altered the near-term outlook, and policy support from all sides \u2013 fiscal, monetary and sectoral \u2013 is required to nurture recovery and expedite return to normalcy. The dent on economic activity due to the second wave of the virus has necessitated the continuation of monetary measures to support the process of economic recovery to make it durable. I therefore vote for a pause on the repo rate. At the same time, there is a need to strengthen forward guidance by stressing the aspect of revival of growth. Thus, the emphasis should be to continue with accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. In this context, the phrase \u2018to revive\u2019 needs to be brought in so as to strengthen the forward guidance and demonstrate the unambiguous commitment of the MPC to revive and sustain the growth process. In fact, focus on revival and sustenance of growth is the most desirable policy option while of course remaining watchful of the inflation trajectory. Going forward, the pace of vaccination and the speed with which COVID-19 second wave 58. can be brought under control will have considerable bearing on the evolving growth as well the inflation trajectory. The Reserve Bank remains committed to undertake pro-active conventional and unconventional measures and to effectively channelling the systemic liquidity to alleviate stress of critical sectors which have borne the brunt of the second wave. In addition to liquidity provided under G-SAP operations, the Reserve Bank will continue to conduct other regular market operations to ensure that liquidity and financial conditions remain congenial, consistent with the accommodative stance of the monetary policy.
