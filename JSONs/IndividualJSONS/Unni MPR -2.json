{"file1": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.75 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL); continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bank- wise NDTL at the LAF repo rate and liquidity under 14-day term repos as well as longer term repos of up to 0.75 per cent of NDTL of the banking system through auctions; and continue with daily variable rate repos and reverse repos to smooth liquidity. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 7.75 per cent. 2. Since the fourth bi-monthly statement of September 2015, global growth continues to be weak. Global trade has slowed further with waning demand and oversupply in several primary commodities and industrial materials. In the United States, inventory accumulation is likely to hold down growth in Q4 of 2015. Industrial production slumped in October on cutbacks in oil drilling, while exports were undermined by the strengthening US dollar. Consumer confidence was, however, supported by the diminishing slack in the labour market. In the Euro area, high frequency indicators such as retail sales, purchasing managers\u2019 indices and unemployment point to an uptick in a still anaemic recovery, with monetary policy expected to be increasingly supportive as risks of undershooting the inflation target persist. In China, slowing nominal GDP growth and high debt continue to raise concerns, especially given the overcapacity in certain sectors. Other emerging market economies (EMEs) continue to face headwinds from domestic structural constraints, shrinking trade volumes and depressed commodity prices. 3. Global financial markets began Q4 on a calmer note after the Federal Open Market Committee stayed on hold in September. Stock markets recorded modest gains in October; major currencies recouped some ground against the US dollar and crude oil traded briefly above US $ 50 per barrel for the first time since July. Markets were also boosted by the easing of monetary policy in China and indications of further stimulus in the Euro area and Japan. Following the early November release of robust US jobs data which increased the likelihood of US monetary policy starting to normalise in December, the US dollar has appreciated significantly, and US yields have hardened. Bond markets in EMEs have generally been tracking the hardening of US yields. Currency markets in EMEs have experienced selling pressures as portfolio investors continue to exit them as an asset class. Unease in investor sentiment is likely to increase ahead of the imminent divergence in advanced economy monetary policy stances. 4. On the domestic front, provisional estimates of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices for Q2 of 2015-16 rose on the back of acceleration in industrial activity. Other indicators suggest the economy is in the early stages of a recovery, though with some areas of continued weakness. 5. Value added in agriculture and allied activities picked up on the modest increase in kharif output and timely policy interventions to stem the effects of the deficient south-west monsoon. Turning to Q3, the north-east monsoon commenced on a listless note, but the subsequent cyclonic weather has improved precipitation and raised the probability of a normal monsoon as predicted by the Indian Meteorological Department. Nevertheless, the exceptionally dry start to the season affected sowing in all major rabi crops, while the excessive rains that followed may have reduced the prospects of coffee and paddy. Overall, the current outlook for agricultural growth in 2015-16 appears moderate at best at this juncture. 6. The Index of Industrial Production picked up in the second quarter. Early results of the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey indicate that there was robust growth in new manufacturing orders in the second quarter, and finished goods inventories declined while raw materials inventories increased. Not all indicators, however, are positive. While urban consumption is showing signs of a pick-up in some areas such as passenger vehicles sales, rural demand has been weakened by two consecutive deficient monsoons and slowing construction activity. Nevertheless, new project announcements as measured by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy grew more strongly in the second quarter. It remains to be seen whether growing public investment can crowd in private investment on a sustained basis, despite the still-low capacity utilisation. 7. Lead indicators of services sector are mixed. The services purchasing managers\u2019 index increased in October 2015 on account of improvement in new business orders. Commercial vehicle sales (reflecting transportation demand) and domestic civil aviation passenger traffic accelerated year-on-year. On the other hand, tourist arrivals, cargo handled at major ports, railway freight traffic, domestic and international air cargo traffic, and measures of construction such as steel consumption slowed. Recent policy initiatives relating to rail, port and road projects are likely to improve construction activity, as will the Reserve Bank\u2019s countercyclical reduction of capital charges on low income housing loans, albeit with gestation lags. As anticipated in our previous policy, retail inflation measured by the consumer 8. price index (CPI) increased for the third successive month in October 2015, pushed up by a surge in the monthly momentum. Food inflation rose sharply in October, driven especially by pulses. 9. CPI inflation excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel also rose for three consecutive months on account of price increases in respect of housing, recreation and amusement, and personal care and effects. Within this broad category, education and health services contributed most to headline inflation. Households\u2019 inflation expectations remain elevated although they have edged lower recently, perhaps in response to lower prices of petrol and diesel. Rural wage growth, as also corporate staff costs, remain subdued. 10. Underlying liquidity conditions tightened in October-November with the festival season draining currency from the system and some slowdown in government expenditure. In response, the Reserve Bank conducted variable rate repo and reverse repo auctions of various tenors in addition to regular 14-day variable rate repo. As a result, average net daily liquidity absorptions of `119 billion in Q2 gave way to average daily net injection of `372 billion in October, which scaled up to `856 billion in November. Money market rates remained around the policy repo rate \u2013 only rising slightly in the second week of November at the height of festival currency demand. Bank credit in the form of personal loans grew strongly as did non-bank financing flows particularly through commercial paper, public equity issues and housing finance. In the external sector, exports contracted for the eleventh month in a row to 11. October, indicative of the persisting weakness in global trade. Excluding petroleum products (PoL), however, the decline in exports was more moderate and early signs of a turnaround are visible in respect of readymade garments, drugs and pharmaceuticals and electronics. With global commodity prices, especially those of crude, softening further, both PoL and non-PoL exports continued to contract, with the latter shrinking for the fourth consecutive month. The decline in bullion imports despite the festival season helped narrow the trade deficit in October as well as over the financial year so far, moderating the current account deficit further. Net foreign direct investment (FDI), external commercial borrowings and accretions to non- resident deposits have risen in relation to last year; however, portfolio outflows from both debt and equity segments rose in November. During 2015-16 (up to November 20), there has been an accretion of US$ 10.8 billion to the foreign exchange reserves. 12. In the bi-monthly monetary policy statement of September, the Reserve Bank assessed that the inflation target for January 2016 at 6 per cent was within reach. Accordingly, it front-loaded its policy action in response to weak domestic and global demand that were holding back investment, while noting that structural reforms and productivity for sustainable growth. impetus 13. Since then, inflation has turned up as anticipated, and is expected to rise further until December before plateauing. Although the seasonal moderation in prices of vegetables and fruits is expected to provide some respite, the El Nino induced shortening of winter may limit this effect. The early indications of rabi sowing together with low reservoir levels suggest that astute supply management by the central government, including close coordination with State governments, is necessary to minimize any shortfall in the rabi crop. While oil prices, barring geopolitical shocks, are expected to remain benign for a few quarters more, the uptick of CPI inflation excluding food and fuel for two months in succession warrants vigilance. Taking all this into consideration, inflation is expected to broadly follow the path set out in the September review with risks slightly to the downside (Chart 1). The outlook for agriculture is subdued, in view of both rabi and kharif 14. prospects being hit by monsoon vagaries. While there are areas of robust growth in manufacturing such as capital goods and passenger cars, weak rural and external demand holds back stronger overall growth. Similarly, while prospects for a revival in service sector activity have been boosted by optimism on new business, pockets of lacklustre activity such as construction weigh on the overall outlook. The step-up in public capital spending and the easing stance of monetary policy provide the enabling environment for a revival in private investment demand, supported by easing input prices and improving conditions for doing business. The growth projection for 2015-16 has accordingly been kept unchanged at 7.4 per cent with a mild downside bias (Chart 2). 15. The Reserve Bank will follow developments on commodity prices, especially food and oil, even while tracking inflationary expectations and external developments. The implementation of the Pay Commission proposals, and its effect on wages and rents, will also be a factor in the Reserve Bank\u2019s future deliberations, though its direct effect on aggregate demand is likely to be offset by appropriate budgetary tightening as the Government stays on the fiscal consolidation path. In the meantime, since the rate reduction cycle that commenced in January, less than half of the cumulative policy repo rate reduction of 125 bps has been transmitted by banks. The median base lending rate has declined only by 60 bps. The Reserve Bank will shortly finalise the methodology for determining the base rate based on the marginal cost of funds, which all banks will move to. The Government is examining linking small savings interest rates to market interest rates. These moves should further help transmission of policy rates into lending rates. In addition, the on-going clean-up of bank balance sheets will help create room for fresh lending. The Reserve Bank will use the space for further accommodation, when available, while keeping the economy anchored to the projected disinflation path that should take inflation down to 5 per cent by March 2017. The sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on 16. Tuesday, February 2, 2016.

", "file4": "Headline CPI inflation is projected to moderate in 2016-17 to around 5 per cent while real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 7.6 per cent in 2016-17. Heightened global financial market volatility continues to pose major risks to these projections. Two landmark developments in the period since the September 2015 Monetary Policy Report (MPR) will fundamentally shape the institutional architecture of monetary policy in India. First, the inflation target of 6 per cent for January 2016 set for itself by the Reserve Bank and subsequently adopted formally under the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement (MPFA) was achieved. With inflation targets having been met consecutively since January 2015, it entrenches credibility in the commitment to the flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework. Inflation is currently within the 4 \u00b1 2 per cent band adopted for FIT. The path to the mid-point of the band will, however, be calibrated so that the output effects of disinflation are smoothed. Accordingly, the next milestone is set at 5 per cent for inflation by the end of 2016-17. Second, in his speech presenting the Union Budget for 2016- 17, the Union Finance Minister announced that the Reserve Bank of India Act is being amended to provide statutory basis for a monetary policy framework and a monetary policy committee (MPC) (Chapter XII of the Finance Bill provides specific features of the proposal). Committee-based decision making will mark a watershed in the historical evolution of monetary policy in India. As stated by the Finance Minister, it is expected to add value and transparency to the monetary policy decisions. As the processes leading up to the functioning of the MPC are set in motion, they will bring in their train significant changes in institutional design and greater accountability. Domestically, the macroeconomic situation has evolved broadly in line with the September baseline scenario, with real gross value added (GVA) growth and inflation trajectories moving in alignment with staff\u2019s forecasts. Chapters II and III describe forecasts and outcomes. Two developments warrant a re-assessment of forecasts (Chart I.1). First, the significant softening of crude oil prices since November 2015 together with the signals in futures prices suggest a lower crude oil price for 2016-17 in this MPR\u2019s baseline scenario (Table I.1). Secondly, prospects for external demand for 2016 are now weaker than envisaged six months back, with downside risks amplified by the worsening macroeconomic outlook tighter financial conditions for emerging market economies (EMEs). Overall, global risks have increased significantly. Inflation expectations of households, corporations and financial market participants are largely adaptive in their formation.

The decline in current perceptions and three months ahead expectations - the previous round - was more pronounced than in 2016 round were the lowest since September 2009.

On the other hand, the January- March 2016 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial manufacturing and services, decelerated during 2015- suggests some salary pressures going forward.

Selling price e t a r n o i t a \ufb02 n I e t a r n o i t a l f n I Professional forecasters (March 2016 round of the survey) expect inflation to remain around 5.2-5.3 per cent during 2016-17. Their medium- and long-run expectations (5 years and 10 years ahead, respectively) were 5.0 per cent and 4.8 per cent, respectively (Chart I.4). These poll results may be indicative of the anchoring of inflation expectations around the Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation target. Information on the final target of monetary policy, i.e., inflation, is typically lagged and provisional when it arrives. The central bank\u2019s own forecast, however, contains all the information relevant to the outlook for inflation, including the policymaker\u2019s preferences regarding the short-run trade-off between output and inflation as well as the estimated effects of shocks working their way through the economy. This inflation forecast, therefore, provides an ideal intermediate target for monetary policy, mirroring the behaviour of the final target over the relevant policy horizon. Inflation forecast targeting frameworks have helped in containing inflation expectations in both advanced and emerging market economies. Importantly, they have also been associated with a lowering of the variability of inflation outcomes. The experiences of Canada (an advanced economy) and Czech Republic (an emerging economy) attest to these gains (Chart I.5). Enhanced credibility in the Reserve Bank\u2019s commitment to its inflation objective can play an important role in the transmission of monetary policy responses to inflation and output shocks (Box I.1). Incorporating signals from various indicators and revisions initial conditions into updated estimates of structural models A monetary policy framework with a commitment to low and stable inflation warrants as a pre-condition that the central bank strengthens its credibility by achieving inflation targets, while recognising and communicating short-run trade-offs. Since January 2014, headline CPI inflation in India has moved broadly in line with the Reserve Bank\u2019s disinflation glide path and more recently, inflation expectations in the economy have started to moderate in reflection of gains in the Reserve Bank\u2019s credibility. Optimal monetary policy responses have been calibrated under three alternative credibility scenarios in a model with India specific features - low credibility (0.25); moderate credibility (0.675); and perfect credibility (1.0). Under the low credibility scenario, the central bank has to raise the policy rate aggressively to create slack in the economy for achieving disinflation (Chart). The sacrifice ratio (the cumulative foregone annual output for each percentage point of inflation decline) is about 2.0. At the other end is the perfect credibility scenario in which the public has full confidence in the framework. The disinflation announcement by the central bank itself reduces inflation expectations. Lower expected inflation raises the real interest rate, without any need for an increase in the nominal rate (in fact, in the model, the nominal rate declines with a lag). This opens up a marginal negative output gap and the sacrifice ratio is only about 0.5. In the intermediate case of moderate credibility stock, the nominal interest rate needs to increase, although not as aggressively as in the low credibility case, so as to induce the necessary slack in the economy, with a sacrifice ratio of around 1.25.

Nadhanael, H. Wang and F. Zhang (2016). \u201cInflation Forecast Targeting for India: An Outline of the Analytical Framework\u201d (Mimeo). yields a projection path in which headline CPI inflation decelerates modestly to 5.3 per cent in Q1 of 2016-17, and then abates to 5.1 per cent in Q2, 5.0 per cent in Q3 and 5.1 per cent in Q4. The 2016-17:Q4 projections are placed in a 70 per cent confidence interval of 3.2 per cent to 7.7 per cent (Chart I.6). Assuming a normal monsoon, further fiscal consolidation in line with the path set out in the Union Budget and no major exogenous or policy shocks, model estimates indicate that CPI inflation would moderate to 4.2 per cent in Q4 of 2017-18, with risks tilted to the upside. The implementation of one-rank-one-pension (OROP) for retired defence employees and the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award, particularly with regard to house rent allowances, poses upward risks to the baseline inflation path, especially as state governments also start implementation. A number of factors could impinge upon the growth outlook for 2016-17. First, slow investment recovery amidst balance sheet adjustments of corporates is likely to hinder investment demand. Secondly, with capacity utilisation in the organised industrial sector estimated at 72.5 per cent, revival of private investment is expected to be hesitant. Thirdly, global output and trade growth remain tepid, dragging down net exports. On the positive side, the government\u2019s \u201cstart-up\u201d initiative, strong commitment to fiscal targets, and the thrust on boosting infrastructure could brighten the investment climate. Household consumption demand is expected to benefit from the Pay Commission award, continued low commodity prices, past interest rate cuts, and measures announced in the Union Budget 2016-17 to transform the rural sector. Consumer confidence remains upbeat, as polled in the March 2016 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey, with optimism on prospects for income and economic conditions (Chart I.7). A similar improvement is visible in the MNI India Consumer Sentiment survey, with households optimistic about the purchasing environment. The corporate sector\u2019s expectations of business conditions dipped but remained positive according to the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey (Chart I.8). Surveys conducted by other agencies indicate a mixed picture (Table I.2). Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank during March 2016 expected output growth to pick up gradually from 7.3 per cent in 2015-16:Q4 to 7.7 per cent in 2016-17:Q4, almost entirely on account of recovery in agriculture and allied activities (Chart I.9 and Table I.3 ). Staff projects GVA growth to improve gradually during 2016-17 to 7.6 per cent, with quarterly growth in a range of 7.3-7.7 per cent and risks evenly balanced around this baseline projection (Chart I.10). These estimates incorporate revisions in assumptions on initial conditions, structural model estimates and off- model adjustments prompted by lead and coincident indicators of economic activity, results from forward- looking surveys, and an assessment of the impact of the 7th CPC and the Union Budget. For 2017-18, real growth in GVA is projected at 7.9 per cent, assuming a normal monsoon, continued boost to consumption from the Pay Commission award and no policy induced structural change or any major supply shock. The baseline projections of growth and inflation are subject to several risks. Plausible alternate scenarios in which some of the risks, both downside and upside, materialise are presented below.

Source: 39th Round of Survey of Professional Forecasters (March 2016) The implementation of the CPC\u2019s recommendations could impact inflation and growth through: a) the direct impact of the proposed increase in the house rent allowance (HRA); b) indirect effects operating through consumption to aggregate demand; and c) inflation expectations channel (see Chapter 2). With propagation to states, there is likely to be an amplification of the total impact on the housing inflation component and hence on overall CPI. The impact is expected to persist up to 24 months. Assuming that the Government implements the Commission\u2019s recommendations by the second quarter of 2016-17, CPI inflation could be, on average, 100-150 bps higher than the baseline in 2016-17 and 2017-18 (Chart I.11). Of course, the Government\u2019s decision on implementation of the 7th CPC is still awaited. Recent developments point towards a weakening of global economic activity. If it materialises, unsettled financial markets could generate spillovers to the broader global economy. A widening of the slack in the global economy by 1 percentage point over the baseline will result in growth in India turning out to be 20-40 bps below the baseline (Chart I.12). Inflation would also be lower by 10-20 bps as lower demand would result in a fall in global commodity prices. While the macroeconomic fundamentals of Indian economy remain strong, volatility in the foreign exchange market on account of external developments can impact both growth and inflation trajectories. A 5 per cent depreciation relative to the baseline assumption could lead to inflation turning up by 10- 15 bps above the baseline forecast for 2016-17 and real GVA growth by around 5-10 bps above the baseline. El Nino conditions continue to pose a risk to the south-west monsoon. About 90 per cent of all El Nino years have led to below normal rainfall and 65 per cent of El Nino years have brought droughts. Assuming a deficiency of 20 per cent in the monsoon, lower agriculture output could lower the overall GVA growth by around 40 bps in 2016-17. Food prices could consequently increase, leading to inflation rising above the baseline by 80-100 bps in 2016-17, even assuming effective government policies relating to food stocks, procurement and minimum support prices (MSPs). There is considerable amount of uncertainty on oil prices in view of political forces impacting oil market dynamics. Supply disruptions from geo-political developments could lead to spikes in oil prices, while weaker global demand could push prices further down. If oil prices rise to around US$50 per barrel, and assuming full pass-through to domestic fuel prices, inflation could be higher by 40-60 bps and growth could be weaker by 20-30 bps. On the other hand, a reduction in crude oil prices to around US$ 20 per barrel could reduce inflation by 80-120 bps, while boosting real GVA growth by 40-60 bps. is beginning to have a Sustained disinflation moderating impact on inflationary expectations. Along with the favourable baseline outlook on crude oil and other commodity prices, and a still negative output gap, inflation is expected to remain inertial but quiescent over 2016-17 and 2017-18. Deviations of the south-west monsoon from normal, upside shocks to oil prices and weak growth in a number of advanced and emerging economies would pose downside risks to the baseline projections of growth and inflation set out in this MPR. Consumer price inflation rose in the second half of 2015-16 before dropping in February with a sharp decline in food prices. Farm and non-farm cost pressures abated and wage growth in rural areas as well as in the organised sector remained weak. The September 2015 MPR projected headline CPI inflation1 to rise from 4.5 per cent in that month to an average of 5.5 per cent in Q3 and 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2015-16. Actual inflation outcomes have closely followed this projected trajectory, and especially the turning points, albeit with a marginal undershoot that has become somewhat pronounced in February 2016 (Chart II.1). Factors that explain the slightly softer than projected inflation readings are: (i) cereal inflation remaining contained by astute supply management; (ii) softening of crude oil prices from December onwards to below US$ 30 per barrel in January 2016, a 12-year low; and (iii) sharp fall in vegetable prices since December 2015. In January, headline inflation was 5.7 per cent, within the disinflation target of 6 per cent set for January 2016. A sharper than anticipated seasonal moderation in vegetable prices took inflation down to 5.2 per cent in February. These developments have considerably bolstered the likelihood that the target of 5 per cent set for 2016-17 will be achieved. Favourable base effects, which had nudged inflation into a dip during July-August 2015, waned from September and consequently, inflation rose for six months successively before subsiding in February (Chart II.2). This period was marked by persisting momentum in month-on-month (m-o-m) price changes during September-November. Although m-o-m price changes turned negative in December, the impact on overall inflation was overwhelmed by a large unfavourable base in that month. By February, the momentum of inflation declined and reinforced the favourable base effect (Chart II.3). Some food groups, especially pulses, have given the distribution of inflation a high positive skew (Chart II.4). Even as inflation ebbs, its persistence remains unchanged reflecting the stickiness in prices of pulses and several categories of services (Chart II.5). A diffusion index2, measuring the tendency of the bulk of prices to move in one direction, shows that for overall CPI as well as constituent goods and services, readings were much above 50 per cent in Q3 and Q4, y, o Y s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e p n i p a G 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A Food and beverages CPI-excluding food and fuel 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year changes in all-India CPI Combined (Rural+Urban). 2 The CPI inflation diffusion index categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their seasonally adjusted prices are rising, stagnant or falling over the previous month. 5 1 - r p A 6 1 - r p A indicating broad-based price increases. In February, the diffusion index for goods fell, while for services it moved up sharply to close to the 100 per cent mark (Chart II.6). In 2015-16 so far, services inflation remained sticky, with its average contribution during April-February slightly higher (25.5 per cent) than its weight (23.4) in overall CPI. The contribution of consumer durables to overall inflation has also remained steady (Chart II.7).

With inflation in cereals, fruits and animal based proteins remaining range-bound, the price behaviour of pulses and vegetables largely determined the food inflation trajectory in this period (Chart II.8). Pulses alone contributed to over 35 per cent of food inflation despite a low share of about 5 per cent within the food and beverages group (Chart II.9). The recurrence of high pulses inflation reflects the structural gap in availability relative to demand. India is the largest producer and consumer of pulses, with cross-border trade accounting 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - v o N Non durable 7 days recall (34.8) Non durable 30 days recall (31.3) 5 1 - g u A Note: Figures in parentheses are the groups\u2019 share in CPI.

The focus of agricultural research needs to shift urgently to pulses with emphasis on developing short-duration pest- and disease-resistant varieties, seed multiplication and measures to boost crop yield so as to start off India\u2019s second green revolution. Vegetables inflation also edged up during November 2015-January 2016 as unseasonal rains and flood in southern states limited the extent of price decline usually seen in winter months. However, as the crop arrival picked up, vegetables prices fell sharply in February, pulling down overall food inflation.

Pressures remained persistent within the protein-rich category, especially meat and fish for which supply has not been able to match up the increasing demand. Cereals and products constitute 21.1 per cent of the CPI food basket. Their prices have risen only marginally, despite a second successive year of deficient monsoon. A range of measures were taken by the Government, including lower order of increases in minimum support prices (MSPs) and higher off-take by states to moderate price pressures. Furthermore, there has been a secular fall in world cereals prices since 2013 leading to a 45 per cent correction in global prices from their peaks. Other factors include slowdown in rural wage growth and falling input costs. In the fuel group, inflation remained steady since September but fell sharply in February (Chart II.10). International prices for kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) remained muted and the gap with respect to domestic administered prices of kerosene and LPG closed over the course of the financial year. Electricity inflation decelerated after December. Firewood, with the second largest weight in the fuel group, continued to remain the major inflation driver in the category. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel edged up gradually from 4.3 per cent in August 2015 to 4.9 per cent in February 2016, largely on account of higher inflation in the sub-groups of transport and communication, and housing. Adjusted for petrol and diesel components of s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e p n n o i t u b i r t n o C 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A transportation, however, inflation in this category remained sticky with only a modest softening in Q4 print (Chart II.11). Petrol and diesel prices exhibited a slower rate of deflation from Q3 than in preceding quarters. This was on account of sequential increase in excise duty rates in petrol and diesel since November 2015 (Chart II.12). The cumulative increase in petrol and diesel excise duties by around ` 12 per litre and ` 14 per litre, respectively, since November 2014 had a direct impact of around 90 basis points on CPI inflation excluding food and fuel and around 40 basis points on headline inflation. Furthermore, in March both petrol and diesel s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e p n o i t u b i r t n o C 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A Clothing and footwear Health and education Household goods and services Excluding food and fuel (per cent) Excluding food, fuel group and petrol & diesel (per cent) e r t i l / ` ) e r t i l / ( y t u d e s i c x e n e s a e r c n I prices increased following the increase in global crude prices. Housing inflation rose gradually and continuously since September. Going forward, the forthcoming implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) recommendations could significantly alter the trajectory of overall inflation over the medium-term (Box II.1). Exclusion based measures of CPI inflation remained sticky due to the impact of non-tradable items in the CPI basket (Chart II.13). Trimmed mean measures of CPI inflation, on the other hand, softened in Q4 and remained below headline inflation. Empirical evidence suggests that food and fuel inflation affects headline inflation in India3 through formation of high inflation expectations, wage increases and rise in other commodity prices. The spill-over from food to non-food inflation is found to be stronger during healthy domestic demand conditions4. Understanding the shocks in food and fuel prices and their spillovers could provide meaningful insights for monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectations. Inflation measured by other consumer price indices moved synchronously with headline CPI inflation. The deflation in WPI appears to have bottomed out in Q2 of 2015-16. GVA and GDP deflators that were in negative 3 Cashin, Paul and Rahul Anand. Ed. (2016) \u201cTaming Indian Inflation,\u201d International Monetary Fund, February. 4 Bordoloi S. (2016) \u201cSpill-over from Food inflation to Core inflation in India: an empirical analysis,\u201d (Mimeo). The implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) awards can have a significant bearing on the inflation trajectory through both direct and indirect channels. In case of subsidised housing provided by the Government, rent charged for the dwelling is the house rent allowance (HRA) normally admissible to the employee along with a nominal license fee. An increase in HRA leads to an increase in imputed rent for Government provided accommodation. Such HRA awards, by their construct, seek to bring parity of housing allowances by the Government with the prevailing market rates. Thus, the direct effect on inflation comes through a higher housing index. The indirect effects stem from an increase in private consumption expenditures and through second-round increases in rental rates for housing in general which could embed higher inflation expectations in the public\u2019s perception. The 6th CPC awards were implemented in August 2008 with HRA awards coming into effect from September 2008. On account of the methodology of collecting rental data in CPI-IW1, the direct impact occurred with a lag during July 2009-January 2010 when the contribution of housing to overall inflation stood in excess of 25 per cent (Chart a). The direct impact of the 6th CPC awards on CPI-IW inflation was estimated at 2.5 percentage points in July 2009, which rose to around 4 percentage points by January 2010. Most of the State- wise housing indices showed significant increases by July 2010, indicating quick follow-through of CPC increases to States (Table). As a result of the staggered increase in State Government employees\u2019 HRA, the rate of increase in housing index remained high till January 2012. The indirect impact of the 6th CPC award on overall CPI-IW inflation worked out to around 60 basis points based on estimates derived from vector autoregression (VAR) and structural models. Chart a: Impact of 6th CPC on CPI-IW: Contribution of Housing to Overall CPI-IW In\ufb02ation (right scale) n o i t u b i r t n o c d e t h g i e W The direct impact of the 7th CPC recommendations on headline inflation is expected to be around 150 basis points. The indirect effects are estimated to be around 40 basis points. The impact of the pay awards is likely to be seen over a period of two years (Chapter 1). Compared to the 6th CPC awards, increase in the housing index would be more quick and continuous2 and indirect effects are likely to be smaller. Moreover, outgo of arrears under 7th CPC awards would be substantially lower but HRA rates would automatically increase when the dearness allowance of the employees crosses threshold levels3. 1 In CPI-IW, the housing index has a weight of 15.3 per cent. Rental data are collected twice a year using a chain based method and the rent index is calculated once in every six months viz., January and July, and kept constant for the following five months. 2 In CPI all India, one sixth of the housing stock in the sample is visited every month and moving rent relative method is used for monthly updation of the house rent index. 3 The HRA rates would increase from 24 per cent, 16 per cent and 8 per cent of the Basic Pay for Class X, Y and Z cities respectively to 27 per cent, 18 per cent and 9 percent when DA crosses 50 per cent of basic, and further revised to 30 per cent, 20 per cent and 10 per cent when DA crosses 100 per cent. 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - r p A 25% trimmed 10% trimmed terrain in Q2, turned positive in Q3. The gap between CPI and WPI started narrowing in Q4 so far (Table II.1). Since the MPR of September 2015, cost pressures in the economy have abated with the sustained fall in global energy and non-energy prices. Domestic input cost pressures also remained subdued. Both industrial and farm costs remained in contractionary mode, albeit with some pick-up in sequential terms in recent months (Chart II.14). In the farm sector, electricity, fertiliser and agricultural machinery prices remained range- bound whereas diesel prices moderated. In case of the non-farm sector, decline in minerals prices and fall in fuel prices provided comfort. Wholesale input price inflation closely tracks the assessment of manufacturing firms participating in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey. The 73rd round of the survey conducted in January-March 2016 reports moderation in input price growth, with the softness in costs extending into the near-term. This sentiment was driven by companies that are benefiting from the fall in international commodity prices, especially those in the petroleum and metal industries. Declining wholesale price inflation attested to the moderation in the cost of raw materials. Falling input prices and weak demand conditions kept corporate pricing power in check. In case of the services sector, however, increase in input costs was reported across all major sectors such as hotels and restaurants, finance, and transport companies. Rural wages, a key determinant of farm costs, recorded moderate growth in nominal terms and remained almost stagnant in real terms (Chart II.15). Part of the moderation in nominal wage growth could be in response to the fall in inflation. Wage growth in the organised sector, reflected in per employee cost, decelerated in Q3 of 2015-16 for both manufacturing and services, with the manufacturing sector registering a sharper decline. While wage growth 1 1 - r p A 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - r p A 2 1 - g u A 3 1 - r p A 3 1 - g u A 4 1 - r p A 4 1 - g u A 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A in manufacturing sector slowed down, value of production in manufacturing sector decelerated at a much faster pace leading to an increase in unit labour cost (as measured by ratio of staff cost to value of production, Chart II.16). Understanding price setting behaviour in an economy is important for monetary policy, especially in gauging rigidities in price formation which generate welfare losses (Blinder et al. (1998)5, Loupias (2013)6, Dias et al. (2015)7). A random effects ordered probit model on the panel of companies covered in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey from 2010-20148, suggests that raw material costs, labour costs and cost of finance influence price setting behaviour with a decreasing order of impact. Pricing decisions generally vary based on company size, seasonality, past price changes as well as in the way firms adjust to shocks. Firms respond more often in response to a price shock by adjusting prices upwards than in the other direction. Similarly, strong demand conditions induce higher increase in prices, whereas the likelihood of lowering the price in case demand is weak is lower. This suggests that the response of expansionary and contractionary monetary policies in controlling inflation will also be asymmetric \u2013 expansionary policy fuels inflation at a rate faster than contractionary policy can contain it9. 5 1 - r p A 5 1 - g u A New forms of transactions such as online exchange and e-commerce are gaining currency in India, especially in the urban areas. The cost of adjustments in prices may be limited in such forms of transactions and, therefore, price rigidities induced by menu costs may turn out to be less relevant. Also, prices could turn out to be extremely flexible with dynamic pricing models and strategies adopted by such firms. These developments complicate the setting of monetary policy as the prices of such items are not currently covered in the official price statistics.

Domestic activity slowed in the second half of 2015-16. Aggregate demand was restrained by stalling fixed investment, weak rural consumption and the ongoing fiscal consolidation. Aggregate supply moderated with the impact of deficient monsoons on agriculture. Gross value added in industry benefited from the decline in input costs while services remained in expansion mode. Domestic economic activity lost pace in the second half of 2015-16, slowed down by muted investment and a prolonged contraction in exports. While private consumption has been the mainstay in holding up aggregate demand, it has largely been an urban phenomenon; coincident indicators of rural consumption have generally remained weak or in negative territory. On the supply side though, some silver linings are discernible. Despite consecutive deficient monsoons and unseasonal weather more recently, foodgrains production is on course to post a modest improvement over the levels recorded a year ago. For industry, the deceleration in the volume of production has been more than offset by the decline in input costs. While service sector activity has been affected by the subdued performance of tradables, non- tradables have been expanding at a reasonable pace. generation and chemicals sectors (Chart III.1). New investment remained subdued in both private and public sectors in response to the prevailing uncertainty in the business environment and muted business confidence (Chart III.2). The production of capital goods fell sharply, co-moving with a deceleration in imports, barring in February (Chart III.3). A durable recovery in the capex cycle continues to remain elusive in the face of considerable slack. Profitability of the non- n o i l l i b Aggregate demand in terms of year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in real gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices moderated in the second half of 2015-16, encountering headwinds from stalling fixed investment (Table III.1).

These coincident indicators suggest that national accounts data for Q4 of 2015-16, especially private final consumption expenditure (PFCE), may be subject to downward revisions from the implicit levels in the advance estimates for the full year. PFCE expanded in H2, in part benefiting from real income gains from lower average inflation than a year ago. The production of consumer durables rose robustly up to January 2016, also reflecting improvement in credit conditions for consumers as banks rebalanced their lending portfolios in favour of personal loans in 4 1 - g u A 5 1 - g u A which stress is relatively low. Sales of commercial and passenger vehicles, production of gems and jewellery and mixers and grinders accelerated, indicative of the resilience of urban consumption. Purchasing managers\u2019 surveys point to some improvement in employment in manufacturing industries. By contrast, rural consumption remained weak in H2; with moderation in wage growth, rural incomes have been depressed by shocks to farm activity from back- to-back deficient monsoons. In Q4, however, there was a pick-up in sales of tractors and two-wheelers which could be indicative of a turning point in the rural economy (Chart III.4). The focus of the Union Budget 2016-17 on reviving the rural economy and doubling rural incomes could support rural consumption demand more enduringly going forward. Overall, the prospects for PFCE have been brightened by the proposal to implement the 7th Pay Commission award and one-rank-one-pension for retired defence personnel. The growth of government final consumption picked up in H2 relative to H1. The Centre\u2019s revenue expenditure rose on higher spending on major subsidies, especially petroleum subsidies, and higher interest payments. Plan revenue expenditure related to social and physical infrastructure made a turnaround in H2 from an absolute decline in H1. Capital expenditure of the Centre decelerated in H2 in relation to H1, reflecting lower growth in capital outlay. States, accounting for nearly two-third of general government capital expenditure, received significantly higher 1 1 - g u A 2 1 - g u A 3 1 - g u A 4 1 - g u A 5 1 - g u A resources on account of their enhanced share in taxes as recommended by the Fourteenth Finance Commission. The expenditure multiplier of States tends to be higher than that of the Centre, which could work towards reviving overall investment in the economy. For the year as a whole, the revised estimates indicate that growth in aggregate expenditure of the Central Government was higher than a year ago with revenue and capital expenditure broadly in line with their respective budgetary targets. Despite a large shortfall vis-\u00e0-vis projected disinvestment, the buoyancy in indirect tax collections and non-tax revenues helped in meeting the fiscal deficit target (Table III.2). The combined fiscal deficit at 6.5 per cent of GDP in 2015-16 is budgeted to have improved in relation to a year ago at 7 per cent. The Union Budget 2016-17 adhered to the path of fiscal consolidation with the Centre\u2019s gross fiscal deficit (GFD) projected to decline by 0.4 percentage points. Adherence to fiscal consolidation path is contingent upon efficient revenue mobilisation - broadening the tax base and rationalising exemptions reflect the Government\u2019s intent in this direction.

Source: Union Budget 2016-17. 2016-17 will face a challenging trade-off sustaining public investment within the straitjacket of shrinking fiscal headroom (Chart III 5). Net exports turned positive in Q3 for the first time in the year and contributed modestly to the increase in aggregate demand in the quarter. The contraction in merchandise exports, which began in December 2014 and peaked in Q3 of 2015-16 was primarily on account of weakening global demand and the persistent fall in international commodity prices. World trade volume was pulled down by a deepening contraction in demand from emerging market economies (EMEs) \u2013 which absorb more than half of India\u2019s exports. POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants) exports declined by more than 50 per cent, mainly attributable to the decline in international crude prices, although export volumes also shrank. Similarly, non-POL exports also contracted in nominal terms, and the highly adverse international environment drove the volume of these exports into negative territory, as in Q2. Merchandise imports recorded a precipitous decline in Q3, mainly on account of POL and gold. Even excluding these items, imports declined by about 9 per cent. The merchandise trade deficit was lower than in preceding quarters and was mainly responsible for the improvement in net exports in the national accounts, since net exports of services remained broadly stable. India continued to benefit from an improvement in the terms of trade, with import prices falling faster than n o i l l i b ` In Q4, exports remained in contraction mode in January and February 2016 across both POL and non-POL products. Exports have declined in nominal terms for fifteen successive months; however, the contraction eased to a single digit on a y-o-y basis. Powering the turnaround were gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronics and chemicals. The decline in imports also slowed. While POL imports fell on account of further softening of crude oil prices, gold imports also declined in anticipation of lower import duties in the Union Budget 2016-17. An important development in Q4 was the resumption of positive growth in non-oil non-gold imports in February after a gap of seven months, largely contributed by imports of machinery, pearls, precious stones, and electronic goods. The trade deficit narrowed sharply in January and February 2016 reflecting these developments. India\u2019s share in world exports has declined from its recent peak of 1.7 per cent in 2014 to 1.6 per cent even as some major advanced economies (AEs) and peer Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) gained share (Chart III.6). This suggests that factors such as the rising incidence of protectionism and competitive depreciation might have affected export performance, since depressed global demand is common to all exporting countries. d n a l i a h T m a n t e i V a i l a r t s u A a i b a r A i d u a S Financing of net exports in Q3 of 2015-16 mainly took the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) which, at US$ 14 billion was the highest ever quarterly net inflow of FDI to India. Foreign portfolio investment, by contrast, recorded net outflows in H2 as heightened turbulence in global financial markets triggered shifts in investors\u2019 risk appetite and flights to safe haven. In March, however, FPIs returned as risk-on sentiments took hold. Other forms of capital inflows, however, remained subdued in Q3. There was an accretion to foreign exchange reserves, taking their level to US$ 355.6 billion as on March 25, 2016, equivalent to about 10 months of imports. The rate of growth in output measured by gross value added (GVA) at basic prices moderated in H2 of 2015-16 on a y-o-y basis (Table III.3). In terms of seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) annualised growth, the loss of momentum was even more stark (Chart III.7). Actual quarterly outcomes have closely adhered to the projection path given in the September MPR, with small deviations in magnitude around the turning points. In Q2, the upturn in construction turned out to be more moderate than initially anticipated. The magnitude of recovery in corporate earnings was also somewhat muted. Real GVA growth slowed between Q2 and Q3 I. Agriculture and Allied Activities II. Industry Manufacturing III. Services #: Implicit growth rate calculated from AE of 2015-16. Source: CSO. in line with projections, but it was 10 basis points above the projection, with manufacturing value added surprising on the upside (Chart III.8). Value added in agriculture and allied activities contracted in Q3 and dragged down overall GVA growth in the quarter. After the south-west monsoon ending started on a listless note with a highly skewed spatial excess precipitation. Floods adversely affected coffee plantations and paddy sowing. The shortfall in the production of pulses - arhar and urad - became binding in the context of the spike in prices of pulses. The north-east monsoon ended in December with a deficiency of 23 per cent of the LPA, particularly acute in central, western and parts of eastern India. In Q4, rabi sowing improved in January mainly on account of return of rain and chill in the north and north-eastern parts of the country. distribution entailing risks to soil moisture. Sowing of major rabi crops except coarse cereals was significantly below normal. An important buffer was the foodgrains stock which remained higher than the new norms through the year. In the first part of November, Tamil Nadu, which receives almost half of its rainfall from these rains, was buffeted by cyclonic weather and Chart III.8: GVAGrowth:ActualversusProjected In the context of crop losses in 2015-16 due to vagaries of weather, the Fasal Bima Yojana announced on January 13, 2016 assumes importance. It envisages a uniform premium of 2 per cent to be paid by farmers for all kharif crops and 1.5 per cent for all rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers will be 5 per cent. The balance premium will be paid by the Government to provide full insurance to farmers against crop loss on account of natural calamities. Remote sensing and smart phones technologies will be used to fast track the payment of claims. s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P In February, the second advance estimates placed foodgrains output at 0.5 per cent higher in 2015-16 than the previous year. This positive outcome reflects the impact of greater weather proofing of Indian agriculture and timely intervention by the government over a wide area, including pre-emptive advisories, contingency plans and promotion of better variety seeds. In recent years, the horticulture sector has been imparting resilience to overall agriculture performance. Growth in production of horticulture crops (5.3 per s e n n o t n o i l l i cent) outstripped the production of foodgrains (1.6 per cent) in terms of the 12-year average (Chart III.9). Although forecasts for the south-west monsoon 2016 are not yet available from the IMD, the chance of El Ni\u00f1o gradually decreases into the spring and turns neutral by May-June-July 2016, according to the US National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration. The chance of La Ni\u00f1a increases to 50 per cent in September- October-November 2016. In the Indian context, some of the strongest El Ni\u00f1o years have been followed by La Ni\u00f1a episodes, resulting in bumper harvests1. Value added in the industrial sector accelerated in H2 of 2015-16, led by manufacturing. By contrast, industrial output measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) could not sustain the base-effect surge in October and fell into contraction through January 2016. Soft commodity prices brought down input costs sharply as well as the implicit GVA deflator for industry, which together explains the wedge between value added and IIP (Chart III.10). In terms of use-based activity, all segments suffered output losses, except festival related demand for consumer durables and intermediate goods in H2. The contraction in industrial output was not, however, broad-based - excluding 2 per cent on either side on account of volatile items, the IIP rose by 0.9 per cent; excluding capital goods, the rest of IIP expanded by 1.4 per cent in December 2015. In Q4, the IIP continued to contract for the third successive month during January 2016, again mainly led by decline in manufacturing. Electricity generation remained resilient and is expected to sustain its performance backed by thermal supplies, while consumer durables continued to gain from favourable base effects. The sharp contraction in capital goods was primarily due to the decline in production of cables and insulated rubber; excluding this lumpy item the IIP would have shown a modest increase of 1.7 per cent. Consumer non-durables continued to shrink in the absence of support from demand. Consequently, the overall consumer goods sector stayed flat, while basic goods decelerated. The manufacturing PMI for March 2016 expanded on the basis of growth of output, new orders, including exports. The Make in India drive, together with new measures announced in the Union Budget to widen the space for FDI, and custom and excise concessions, are expected to help lift industrial performance. In this context, the start-up India initiative assumes importance as a potential game changer in lifting business sentiment. The objective is to create an ecosystem that is conducive for entrepreneurship, employment generation and wealth creation. Gross value added in the services sector maintained a stable pace of expansion in H2, as it had in the first half of 2015-16. All constituents shared in this growth, although financial services, real estate and professional services experienced some moderation. In Q3, the services PMI was in expansionary territory in October on new business orders, but it fell to a five- month low in November as new business orders slowed down (Chart III.11). In December, the index surged back but polled firms indicated a reluctance to hire. Other lead and coincident indicators of service sector activity were mixed and reflected sector-specific dynamics. By October through the quarter, passenger and commercial vehicles sales registered healthy growth on festival related demand and one-time replacement requirements to comply with fuel emission norms. On the other hand, the two wheelers segment remained subdued compared to other segments as rural demand remained moribund. Steel consumption and cement production \u2013 compositely, a lead indicator of construction activity \u2013 anticipated a slowdown in an environment of legacy issues especially delays in clearances and land acquisition, weak demand and unsold inventory. The revival in roads and highways construction and commercial real estate activity cushioned the downturn. In the trade sector, port traffic decelerated. In Q4, the services PMI remained in expansion zone but dipped sequentially, unable to sustain the smart improvement in January 2016. The moderation occurred on account of softer growth in new business. Other indicators moved diversely. Sales of commercial vehicles showed an uptick in January, while passenger vehicles sales decelerated to lowest in seven months possibly because of correction in inventory management and ban in the national capital region (NCR) on registration of diesel vehicles with higher engine capacity. Sales of passenger vehicles continued to remain subdued in February 2016 exacerbated by strikes in Haryana affecting supplies while commercial vehicles sales continue to accelerate. Overall freight traffic and particularly in respect of coal, the largest commodity carried by railways, contracted during February 2016. Port cargo was, however, boosted by higher tonnage of POL and containerised cargo. 3 1 - g u A 4 1 - g u A 5 1 - g u A Potential output generally refers to the level of output that is consistent with low and stable inflation. Divergence between the levels of actual output and potential output and expressed as a proportion of potential output, i.e. the output gap, indicates excess demand when it is positive, leading to inflationary pressures. There is now a wide consensus that potential output across the world has been lastingly impaired since or even before the global financial crisis2. By how much should current estimates of potential output be lowered is, however, unclear since these estimates tend to be highly sensitive to the choice of data/sample period and methodology. Nonetheless, misperceptions of the current output gap could lead to notably higher inflation in the near term, and sharply lower growth and increasing external imbalances in the case of delay in recognising the error (IMF, 2011)3. The output gap in India was positive during Q1 of 2005-06 through Q1 of 2012-13 except in Q4 of 2008-09, and turned negative since Q2 of 2012-13 with the downturn in the business cycle; it was (-)0.6 per cent in Q3 of 2015-16. The derived rate of growth of potential output was around 5 per cent during 1981-1991, increasing to around 6 per cent during 1992-2002 and to 8 per cent during 2003-2008. It has, however, fallen in the post global crisis period to around 7 per cent during 2009-2015 (Box III.1). 2 Anand, R., K.C. Cheng, S. Rehman, and L. Zhang. 2014. \u201cPotential Growth in Emerging Asia.\u201d IMF Working Paper, No. WP/14/2, January. 3 IMF, 2011, World Economic Outlook, April. Methods for estimating potential output can be broadly categorised into three groups: (i) purely statistical methods (e.g. time trend estimation; statistical filters), (ii) methods that combine structural relationships with statistical methods (e.g., the Kalman filter) and (iii) structural methods which are based on economic theory (e.g., the production function approach). Each methodology has limitations which influence the estimate of potential output and appropriate caveats are warranted in the interpretation of results4. Against this backdrop, a pragmatic approach is to estimate potential output employing a battery of statistical and structural methods on quarterly GVA data (Q2:1980 \u2013 Q4;2015)5 and then to combine these results using principal component analysis to produce composite estimates of the output gap. This estimate closely co-moves with inflation excluding food and fuel and capacity utilisation \u2013 two indicators of aggregate demand conditions \u2013 attesting to the robustness of the estimation (Chart a & b). $ Inflation excluding food and fuel. : Source: Staff stimates. The recent deceleration in India\u2019s potential growth is attributed largely to slowdown in investment and a modest decline in total factor productivity. Hence, key to acceleration of India\u2019s growth lies in augmentation of capital formation and raising the productivity of labour and capital so as to be able to operate the economy at the technology possibility frontier. 4 While the production function approach is regarded as superior as it provides economic explanations for the movement of potential output, univariate statistical filters like Hodrick-Prescott (HP), Rotemberg and Band-Pass (BP) are subject to endpoint problems due to the one-sidedness at both ends of the time series. See Bhoi and Behera (2016) for a comprehensive review. 5 The unavailability of back series of national account statistics is a major constraint to estimate potential output, which has been handled with splicing the series. Therefore, the estimated potential output from these data is required to be used with caveats. Money, bond and credit markets have been largely insulated from global spillovers, while foreign exchange and equity markets have experienced bouts of volatility. Liquidity conditions generally tightened in the second half of the year and proactive liquidity management alleviated pressure on money market rates. Long-term yields exhibited a tightening bias till February and risk spreads reflected both corporate sector stress and asset quality concerns in banks. Total flow of resources to the corporate sector remained buoyant, with industry receiving a rising proportion of increase in non-food credit. With the turn of the year, global financial markets were seized with renewed fears of a weakening global economy. Volatility surged, dispelling the calm in the preceding quarter that had enabled a priced-in response to the start of normalisation of the US monetary policy in December. As the final section of this chapter shows, financial markets in India exhibited differentiated responses to these developments. Money, bond and credit markets have been largely insulated from global developments. By contrast, foreign exchange and equity markets experienced bouts of volatility and were vulnerable to rapid shifts in risk assessments. Money market rates hardened in Q4 as the spending restraint by the Government became pronounced by mid-January and cash balances began to build-up well ahead of the Union Budget. Term premia rose as secondary market three month CP and certificate of deposit (CD) rates inched up (Chart IV.1). Another factor squeezing liquidity through the quarter was the firming up of non-food credit offtake that started in December. Liquidity tightness was exacerbated from the second week of February, imparting an upside to the WACR. On March 31, the WACR spiked with the Government\u2019s cash balances rising to `1.9 trillion and banks building excess reserves of 23 per cent above the requirement. Money markets experienced distinct two-way movements through Q3 of 2015-16. Overnight rates traded with a softening bias in the first half of October, having fully transmitted the end-September policy rate reduction of 50 basis points (bps) amidst easing liquidity conditions. Other short-term rates moved synchronously, with interest rates on both commercial papers (CPs) and 91-day treasury bills (TBs) declining by about 38 bps in response to the repo rate cut. From the second half of October, however, redemption pressures in the equity market due to selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) constrained lending by mutual funds in the collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (CBLO) market and liquidity pressures spread to other segments of the overnight spectrum. The slowing pace of Government expenditure and the onset of festival-related currency demand also contributed to tighter liquidity conditions. Barring brief respites in the early part of each month due to salaries/pension spending by the Government and some return of currency to the banking system after the festivals in late November, the weighted average call rate (WACR) generally remained a little above the repo rate through the quarter - especially around the outflow of advance tax payments in mid-December. Two factors are notable in recent money market activity. First, asymmetry in the intra-day evolution of the WACR reflects the market microstructure. Money market rates are generally higher during the first hour of trading, reflecting reversal of the previous day\u2019s borrowings as also funding requirements for the day ahead (Chart IV.2). Market activity again picks up during the last hour of trading on reassessment of liquidity positions by banks to meet reserve requirements and . g v a n e r a h s % M Market repo vol other cash flows. The first and last hour of trading covers about 70-75 per cent of daily call market volumes. Secondly, the heightening of liquidity pressures towards the close of Q4 is a recurring phenomenon every year as market participants rush for liquidity for balance sheet adjustments and to meet year-end targets. Cash balances with the Reserve Bank become a preferred asset at this time of the year. With the unwinding of these cash balances, liquidity conditions ease significantly in early April, again a recurring phenomenon year after year. In the bond market, yields on government securities (G-secs) \u2013 which had started to ease ahead of the monetary policy easing cycle \u2013 got increasingly disconnected and firmed up through the second half of 2015-16. After the announcement of the Union Budget, however, yields steadily eased (Chart IV.3). From the second week of October, the benchmark yield traded with a hardening bias, mainly due to higher primary treasury issuances in October, an uptick in inflation and the depreciation of the rupee brought on by portfolio investment sales. Barring high intensity global events that prompted sell-offs globally, domestic factors have played a predominant role in driving up yields. A rolling regression of India\u2019s 10-year G-sec yield on the US 10-year treasury yield suggests that the sensitivity of domestic yields to global yields has subsided significantly in the recent period1 (Chart IV.4). In Q4 of 2015-16, G-sec yields traded with an upward bias. Successive increases in monthly inflation readings, uncertainty on the likely fiscal stance in the Union Budget and concerns about compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) norm weighed on yield movements. The introduction of the new 10-year benchmark security on January 11, an OMO purchase auction of ` 100 billion on January 20 and the increase in the investment limit for FPIs in the debt segment improved sentiment in the bond market, but it was 1 Daily data have been used from January 2012 to March 2016. Since the variables used are non-stationary, they have been used in first difference form in the quarterly rolling regression. The window size for regression analysis is one year. transient and yields started hardening by the third week of January 2016 right up to the last week of February, due to likely over-supply of papers relative to demand \u2013 State Development Loans (SDLs), tax free bonds and Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) bonds. Positive sentiment generated by the Union Budget softened yields, with 10-year generic yield declining by about 16 bps on February 29. G-sec yields edged up in the first half of March on profit-booking by market participants, but traded with a softening bias in the second half on the lower inflation reading for February and dovish guidance by the Fed. High rated corporate bond yields had eased in the early part of Q3, fully pricing in the September policy rate cut. In Q4, however, a hardening bias set in, but eased during the second half of March. Lower rated corporate bond yields rose on concerns related to balance sheets and rising incidence of restructuring of corporate debt by Indian banks (Chart IV.5). The overall corporate stress ratio \u2013 the number of rating upgrades divided by the number of downgrades \u2013 declined sharply, indicating deterioration of credit quality of Indian firms. Overall, corporate bond spreads widened though the issuance of corporate bonds (public issues and private placements) increased significantly during the year. Equity markets began Q3 on a buoyant note, lifted by the policy rate cut on September 29 which boosted rate-sensitive sectors. With positive global cues, including signals of additional accommodation by the s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P ECB and the Fed holding rates steady, the sensex was supported by the resumption of portfolio flows while domestic institutional investors, including mutual funds, engaged in profit-booking. Towards the end of October, however, indications of monetary policy normalisation in the FOMC\u2019s December meeting, weak quarterly earnings of some domestic blue chip companies and caution ahead of Bihar elections triggered a fresh slide on the domestic bourses. Bearish sentiment persisted through December, with pessimism building on the slow pace of structural reforms, higher CPI inflation readings, slowdown in industrial production, disappointing Chinese economic data and terror attacks in Europe. At the start of Q4, global spillovers pulled down the sensex. A slump in oil prices to below US$ 30 per barrel \u2013 a 12-year low \u2013 and dismal Chinese data coupled with another devaluation of the renminbi triggered a massive retrenchment of portfolio investment across EMEs. Equity markets in India were also affected by weaker than expected corporate earnings forecasts and the depreciation of the rupee. In February, there was a resurgence of stress in global financial markets, triggered by a meltdown in stock markets in China. As spillovers spread, investors questioned the ability of highly leveraged European banks to service their contingent convertible bonds. In India, global risk aversion was amplified by public sector banks declaring steep fall/increase in their net profits/losses in Q3 due to higher provisioning for non-performing assets (NPA) and as a result, banking stocks witnessed a sharp fall in market valuation. The sensex dropped by 22 per cent from its January 2015 highs to a 21-month low and erasing all gains since May 2014. The sensex surged a day after the Union Budget with a return of portfolio flows, improvement in business sentiment and recovery in the rupee amidst strong cues from Asian and European equity markets after China\u2019s central bank cut the reserve requirement ratio. The sensex continued gaining in the following days with heavy buying by foreign investors, surge in banking stocks after core capital requirement rules were eased, appreciation of the rupee and rallies in Asian equity markets on expectations of further stimulus from the ECB. Compared with the secondary market, the initial public offering (IPO) market remained upbeat, recording a four year high mobilisation in 2015 with 64 IPOs aggregating to about US$ 2.2 billion (about ` 139 billion). While the IPO index generated return of 19 per cent in 2015, the benchmark sensex yielded a negative return of 5.0 per cent in 2015 (Chart IV.6). The rupee traded with an appreciating bias against the US dollar in the first half of October, buoyed by the weakness in the US dollar on deferment of monetary policy normalisation in the FOMC\u2019s September 17-18 policy meeting (Chart IV.7a). From mid-October, however, the rupee started to depreciate with the strengthening of the US dollar on increasing market expectations of an increase in the Federal Funds rate in December. Bunching of importers\u2019 demand for foreign currency and risk-averse FPI outflows also imparted downward pressures to the rupee (Chart IV.7b). Barring intermittent gains on profit-taking and positive domestic cues, including better than expected GDP data for Q2, narrowing of the merchandise trade deficit and expansion of the space for FDI, the rupee continued to depreciate through November and December. The December lift-off of the Federal Funds rate turned out to be fully factored in by markets. Dovish Fed guidance brought back stability in foreign exchange markets across EMEs, and the rupee appreciated towards the close of the quarter. r e b m e c e D also imparted downside to the rupee. The decision of the Bank of Japan to push interest rate into negative territory accentuated the risk-on sentiment towards EMEs in general, resulting in a modest appreciation of the rupee relative to the extent of firming up of several EME currencies (Chart IV.8). The onset of Q4 brought with it a dramatic shift in the foreign exchange market. Global spillovers produced a renewed bout of downward pressure from the beginning of 2016 as risk aversion and flight to safety intensified on pervasive bearish sentiment. Domestic developments such as rise in inflation, weaker industrial production and continued portfolio outflows Following the announcement of the Union Budget, the rupee appreciated. Since mid-March, the return of portfolio flows to equity market has sustained the upside in the foreign exchange market. In terms of both nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and real effective exchange rate (REER), the rupee depreciated during 2015-16 by 4.1 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, partly offsetting the appreciation in 2014- 15 (Table IV.1). n o i l l i Credit market activity was weighed down by weak demand due to sluggish industrial and corporate activity and the presence of considerable slack. In addition, risk aversion among banks emanating from asset quality concerns restrained credit flows. Non-food bank credit, which had slipped into an extended single- digit growth trough in the first half of 2015-16, picked up in the second half of the year and recorded y-o-y growth rates of 10.7 per cent and 11.3 per cent, respectively, in Q3 and Q4. The upturn is discernible even after adjusting for the operations of Bandhan and IDFC Bank \u2013 two new private banks that commenced activity during the year (Chart IV.9a). Noteworthy in this pick-up was that the flow of credit to industry, which had declined in the first half, turned around and accounted for 29 per cent of the total increase in non- food credit in Q3, followed by a share of 34 per cent in 2015-16 (excluding two new banks) Appreciation (+) / Depreciation (-) (per cent) P: Provisional. Note: REER figures are based on Consumer Price Index (Combined). Source: Reserve Bank of India. Q4 (Chart IV.9b). By and large, the improvement in bank credit flows has been led by the personal loans category, especially housing, in which delinquency and collateral constraints are comparatively less binding. The flow of resources from banks and non-banks to the commercial sector increased by 25 per cent in 2015-16. Flows from non-banks, which include CPs, public issues, financing from all India financial institutions, housing finance companies as well as foreign sources, increased by 12 per cent. In response to the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 125 bps, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declined by 90 bps (up to February 2016) and even the WALR on outstanding rupee loans softened by 53 bps (Table IV.2). The median base rate of banks, however, declined by 60 bps as against a higher decline of 80 bps in their median term deposit rates during the same period, reflecting the preference of banks to protect profitability in the wake of deteriorating asset quality and higher provisioning. The Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) system, effective April 1, 2016, is expected to impart greater transparency in the pricing of credit and improve the transmission of policy rate into the lending rates. As on April 4, the median overnight MCLR of 26 banks, accounting for about 83 per cent of total bank credit, was 50 bps lower than the median base rate, while the median MCLR across all tenors was lower by 25 bps.The Government\u2019s decision to remove the spread of 25 bps on select small savings schemes vis- a-vis G-sec yields of comparable maturities, and introduce a more frequent (quarterly, instead of annual) resetting of the administered interest rates on all small savings schemes effective Q1 of 2016-17 should align small savings rates with market rates and contribute to strengthening transmission. Administered interest rates on small savings schemes have been marked down by 40-130 bps for Q1 of 2016-17 as compared with those for 2015-16. In Q3 of 2015-16, the Reserve Bank started the Asset Quality Review (AQR) to ensure that banks were taking proactive steps to correctly classify their loan portfolios, with the deadline of March 2017 to clean up by making full provision. Fifteen public sector banks reported losses on their domestic operations in Q3 of 2015-16 as a result of increased provisions for doubtful/loss assets and write-offs of bad loans. Barring transient periods of surpluses on account of Government spending on salaries/pensions/subsidies \u2013 usually in the first week of every month \u2013 liquidity conditions generally tightened in the second half of the year beginning from mid-October as the pace of Government expenditure slowed and the seasonal increase in currency demand for the festival season took hold. In anticipation of the mid-December outflow of advance tax payments, the Reserve Bank conducted fine-tuning operations, including a 28-day variable rate term repo auction (` 210 billion) and an open market purchase operation (` 100 billion) as well as term repos of tenors varying from overnight to 13-day, completely offsetting the build-up of Government balances. Liquidity injected by the Reserve Bank rose from ` 436 billion at the end of October to ` 1,322 billion at the end of December 2015. In January 2016, as cash balances of the Government jumped from ` 762 billion on January 6 to ` 1.5 trillion by January 22, the Reserve Bank expanded its scale of operations, introducing a 56-day variable rate term repo, and also provided permanent liquidity through an open market purchase operation (` 100 billion) on January 20, followed up by another auction of equivalent amount on February 8. Durable liquidity was also injected through buyback operations (` 375 billion) on behalf of the Government. Three open market purchases aggregating to ` 414 billion were also conducted in March, besides additional term repos of tenors ranging from 2-day to 28-day involving a cumulative amount of ` 1.75 trillion to ensure adequate liquidity in the system. The pre-emptive approach of the Reserve Bank can be gauged from the fact that on March 15-16, term repos to the tune of ` 1 trillion were conducted to manage the extreme tightness induced by advance tax outflows. By March 16, the liquidity injection by the Reserve Bank from all sources rose to ` 2.7 trillion, including its regular facilities. WADTDR: Weighted Average Domestic Term Deposit Rate. WALR: Weighted Average Lending Rate. *: Data are provisional and relate to February 2016. Source: Reserve Bank of India (based on SMR VI AB submitted by banks). n o i l l i b n o i l l i b As pointed out earlier in this chapter, liquidity tightness in Q4 is a recurring phenomenon, especially in March. Among the major frictional drivers of liquidity, larger than usual swings in Government balances necessitated stepping up offsetting net LAF injection/absorption operations this year (Chart IV.10). Additional headroom was also provided within the prescribed SLR for accommodating the maintenance of higher LCR, which alleviated liquidity concerns by freeing up excess SLR to be used for collateralised money market/LAF transactions2. These operations were reflected in the growth of reserve money at 14.5 per cent*, significantly higher than the growth in nominal GDP at 8.6 per cent in 2015-16. Moreover, there was a large overhang of permanent liquidity injected in 2014-15, when net foreign currency asset purchases (adjusted for OMO sales) were as high as 190 per cent of the increase in currency. Broad money (M3) growth trailed the growth in reserve money in the second half of the year, mirroring modest deceleration in growth of deposits and the impact of relatively higher growth in currency on the money multiplier. With proactive liquidity management, the effective policy corridor in the second half of the year was +36/-27 bps** pointing to the marksmanship achieved in terms of the Reserve Bank\u2019s operating target, notwithstanding perceptions about persisting deficit liquidity (Chart IV.11). The WACR spread over the repo rate, in fact, remained within +/-10 bps on 50 per cent of the total number of trading days, and within +/- 20 bps on 85 per cent of the total number of trading days. In this context, the issue of the appropriate width of the liquidity management corridor assumes significance (Box IV.1). Corridor systems widely adopted by central banks in their monetary policy operations encounter both consensus and dilemmas or trade-offs. There is consensus that: (a) the operating target should be an interest rate over which the central bank has the most control \u2013 the overwhelming preference in country practices is for the overnight money market rate; (b) a sound and active liquidity management framework is essential to steer the target rate close to the policy rate; (c) there is a commitment to smoothing volatility in the target rate; and (d) reasonably accurate liquidity 2 The assets allowed as Level 1 High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) for the purpose of computing the LCR of banks, inter alia, used to include Government securities in excess of the minimum SLR requirement, and within the mandatory SLR requirement up to 7 per cent of NDTL. Banks were permitted to reckon government securities held by them up to another 3 per cent of NDTL under the mandatory SLR, thereby raising the total carve-out from SLR to 10 per cent of NDTL. forecasts drive the active liquidity operations. The dilemmas include: (i) which instrument to use for modulating liquidity conditions; (ii) which interest rate to target \u2013 collateralised or uncollateralised, and overnight or short-term; and (iii) width of the corridor \u2013 too wide a corridor allows volatility in the operating target while too narrow a corridor disincentivises market development. International experience suggests that a preference for narrowing the policy rate corridor has generally been driven by the emphasis on minimising volatility in the overnight rate, as too wide a corridor appears to distort policy signals (Maehle, 2014) and encourages liquidity hoarding risks associated with high volatility may, in fact, dent market development, and market feedback in a volatile market for fine tuning liquidity operations may also become noisier. Countries with narrow symmetrical corridors (+/- 25 bps in the case of Australia and Canada) seem to \u2018middle\u2019 their operating targets better since market participants are encouraged to borrow and lend among themselves rather than use the central bank\u2019s facilities (Table 1). The Bank of Thailand established a corridor of +/-50 bps in 2006, and did not have to change it thereafter as it helped in achieving the target in both normal and crisis times. The Bank of England switched to a symmetrical +/-25 bps corridor in 2006, after experimenting with the asymmetrical +150/-100 bps corridor earlier. Volatility dropped significantly after the switchover. The Riksbank in 2000 started with a corridor of +/-75 bps but after the global crisis, the corridor was narrowed to +/-50 bps in 2009. In India, the stylised evidence shows that volatility in the operating target has reduced markedly over the years. Rolling period standard deviations of the call rate for 7 days to 90 days have declined to a tenth from 4.5 per cent in 2006-07 to around 0.4 per cent in 2014- 15 and further to 0.2 per cent in 2015-16. The efficacy of the revised liquidity management framework in Various segments of the domestic financial market spectrum have been impacted by bouts of turmoil in global financial markets and heightened volatility. In view of the disruptions in normal functioning of these markets and the implications for monetary policy transmission, identifying, measuring and managing spillovers has become a major challenge for domestic macroeconomic policies. In India, both domestic factors and global spillovers have conditioned movements in financial markets, though increasingly domestic factors appear to have played a more prominent role. Money, bond and credit markets are largely insulated in terms (Percentage points) reducing volatility in the overnight money markets is also validated by conditional volatility estimated by an I-GARCH (1, 1) model: spikes now occur with a reduced frequency. Fleetness in anticipating and responding to market aberrations has played an important role in these recent outcomes. Even intra-period reserve maintenance flux is getting evened out and final maintenance day effects are statistically insignificant. 1 Patra, M.D., Kapur M, Kavediya R, and Lokare S.M.

However, global spillovers tend to influence volatility in all segments3. Among domestic factors, liquidity conditions, market microstructure, inflation and fiscal outlook, and market concerns relating to asset quality of banks and corporate balance sheets have a prominent influence on market activity. Proactive liquidity management is critical to transmission, but by itself cannot prevent disruptions arising from overwhelming global developments. 3 Patra, M.D.; Pattanaik, S; John, J. and Behera, H.K .(2016) \u201cGlobal Spillovers and Monetary Policy Transmission in India\u201d, RBI Working Paper Series, WPS(DEPR):03/2016. Global economic activity has slackened further and international trade remains subdued, while downside risks have increased. Weak demand and soft commodity prices have rekindled fears of deflation in some key AEs, prompting renewed divergence in monetary policy stances. With fragile domestic economic fundamentals, EMEs remain vulnerable to swings in market sentiments and capital outflows. Since the MPR of September 2015, the global economy has weakened, with rising downside risks prompting downward revisions to forecasts by several international agencies. Still subdued commodity prices and trade flows coupled with rising volatility in capital flows, exchange rates and financial markets have amplified the downside risks more recently. Stagnant investment across economies remains the main drag on growth. Clouding the outlook is the continuing loss of momentum in EMEs, overlaid by the anticipated slowdown in China and tightening financial conditions. Global financial markets remained relatively calm in Q4 of 2015, factoring in the US monetary policy shift to normalisation. Sentiment was boosted by monetary policy easing in China and indication of further monetary stimulus in the Euro area and Japan. In January, however, financial markets were in turmoil, with an upsurge in volatility. Fears of further weakening of the Chinese economy and the depreciation of the Renminbi (RMB) set off capital outflows from China and triggered sell-offs in equity and debt markets across AEs and EMEs. Worries about profitability of banks churned global financial markets again in February before they began recuperating in March. of 2016. Growth in the Japanese economy suffered a setback in Q4 of 2015 as the fall in private consumption overshadowed the expansion in exports. Continuing decline in factory output amplifies the fear of contraction in GDP in Q1 of 2016. The UK economy picked up in Q4 of 2015, driven by its services sector. Business confidence, however, remains subdued in Q1 of 2016 (Table V.1). In EMEs, the overall macroeconomic environment remains challenging, with growth having weakened further in recent quarters. Their relative contribution to world output growth shrank in 2015 (Chart V.1). The Chinese economy recorded the lowest quarterly expansion in Q4 of 2015 since 2009, with downside The US economy slowed in the second half of 2015 as the private sector cut back capital investment in the face of an inventory glut, while a strong dollar and tepid global demand weighed on exports. Industrial production remained in contraction mode in Q1 of 2016. Consumer sentiment remained upbeat, however, despite mixed sentiment in labour market conditions and retail sales. In the Euro area, growth decelerated in Q4 of 2015 due to sagging exports, though private consumption was boosted by low oil prices and favourable financing conditions. Consumer confidence and economic sentiment have fallen significantly in Q1 s t n i o p e g a t n e c r e P risks looming large in terms of weak external demand, factory overcapacity, slowing investment, a soft property market and high debt levels. Recessionary conditions persisted in Brazil in the closing quarter of 2015, as worsening labour market conditions and falling fuel and electricity subsidies continue to adversely impact private consumption. Investment was hamstrung by a combination of low domestic demand, high borrowing costs and weak business confidence. In Russia, economic activity remained in contraction. South Africa continued to face severe droughts, coupled with a plunging currency and political turmoil. By contrast, Turkey, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines recorded improved growth. Going forward, the OECD\u2019s latest composite leading indicators suggest tentative signs of stabilisation in China and a loss of momentum in Brazil and Russia (Chart V.2). Global cross-border trade flows remained weak in 2015 and in January 2016 as well, propagated largely through manufacturing and investment linkages. Reduced demand for imports from China, sluggish import- intensive investment in other EMEs, particularly in extractive industries, and increasingly unremunerative terms of trade have played important roles. Nevertheless, trade volume has shown some resilience (Chart V.3). Looking ahead, a modest improvement in world trade flows is projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in 2016. Global commodity prices softened further through Q4 of 2015. A recent uptick starting in mid-February 2016 is shadowed by excess supply, faltering demand from EMEs and strengthening of the US dollar. Crude oil prices dipped to a 12-year low of below US$ 30 per barrel in January 2016 under the weight of supply glut, combined with weaker than expected demand due to a milder winter in the northern hemisphere. The weakening US dollar and anticipation of OPEC freezing output in its scheduled April meeting, however, has boosted crude oil prices lately. Metal prices fell for four consecutive months till January; however, prices of gold gained by around 16 per cent during Q1of 2016 as demand for safe haven assets increased. Agricultural prices, which declined in Q4 of 2015, rose marginally for two consecutive months up to February due to supply concerns arising from still intense El Nino conditions (Chart V.4a and b). other Latin American countries \u2013 and domestic structural rigidities - in South Africa and Turkey (Chart V.5a and b). Thailand and Korea have benefited from low commodity prices, and inflation has eased below target since late 2012 and early 2013, respectively. Globally, inflation pressures were contained by weak global growth and the continuing softness in commodity prices. In the US, inflation inched up since the beginning of Q4 of 2015 through January, but it eased in February and is expected to remain well below 2.0 per cent in the near- term. The Euro area slipped back into deflation in February, after experiencing a creeping up of inflation in the three months up to January. Similarly, in Japan, inflation remains near zero since Q4 of 2015, and downside risks persist. By contrast, a number of EMEs continue to reel under high inflation due to currency depreciation \u2013 in Brazil, Russia and Monetary policy stances have been diverging across both AEs and EMEs. In December 2015, the Fed raised its policy rate after almost a decade \u2013 to a target range for the fed funds rate of 0.25-0.5 per cent. However, the future policy rate path of Fed remains uncertain with the rate being kept on hold in January and March alongside dovish guidance. On the other hand, as fears of growth slowdown and deflation resurfaced, Japan and the Euro area have further eased unconventional accommodation. The European Central Bank (ECB) expanded its QE programme in March, reduced the deposit rate further into negative territory (-0.4 per cent) and cut its policy rate to zero. The Bank of Japan l i z a r B a c i r f A h t u o S (BoJ), while maintaining its quantitative and qualitative easing programme, introduced a negative deposit rate since January. While the aim of countries pursuing negative interest rates has been to improve domestic growth and inflation outlook, it has given rise to global concerns about financial stability (Box V.1). Monetary policy in EMEs has also been diversely stanced, reflective of varied macroeconomic conditions. China has aggressively cut deposit and lending rates and relaxed required reserves, including in March, to modulate the pace of economic slowdown. Indonesia, which lowered reserve requirements to boost bank Post the Great Financial Crisis, Sveriges Riksbank, Danmarks Nationalbank, the ECB, the Swiss National Bank and, most recently, the BoJ have introduced negative interest rates on deposits at the central bank, and lowered the target for the overnight rate to below zero in some of them. Although the overall objective has been to raise economic growth and counter deflationary conditions by deterring saving, and encouraging borrowing and risk taking, scepticism has developed about the efficacy of the policy in achieving anything beyond inflating asset prices and depreciating currencies competitively. First, banks may choose to borrow less from the central bank in order to lower excess reserves and avoid the negative deposit rate. This would put upward pressure on rates in the interbank and bond market, offsetting the stimulative impact of the negative policy rate. Second, even if negative interest rates are transmitted to money markets, retail deposits may remain insulated due to banks\u2019 reluctance to pass it on to depositors for fear of losing deposits. Third, there could be offsetting adjustment in lending rates among sectors such as in Switzerland where negative rates have led to a rise in mortgage rates to protect margins. Fourth, unless there is transmission of the negative interest rate into lending and deposit rate, it would lose its rationale of boosting domestic demand. Lastly, if persisted for long, negative interest rates may encourage financial excesses, including instruments that emulate currency, allow tax avoidance and undermine the policy itself. As for actual outcomes, negative interest rates could be impacting profit margins of banks already - concerns about profitability of banks in early February 2016 led to a sharp fall in bank equities in the Euro area which spread across AEs and EMEs. Over time, this could get entangled with volatility in financial markets due to persistent mispricing and financial imbalances, setting them up for the shocks from inevitable corrections. It is also observed that under negative interest rates, a tendency for resorting to currency depreciation to attract foreign demand gets heightened (Lipton, 2016). t n e c r e P (q-o-q, annualised) t n e c r e P A simple event-study analysis corresponding to day/ month/quarter of introduction of the policy shows uncertain impacts on both GDP and inflation as well as perverse outcomes - decline in GDP growth and deeper deflation in Switzerland (Chart a and b). However, the counterfactual remains that the situation could have been worse without the policy. 5 1 - r p A financing capacity in November, reduced the policy rate in January and February on growth concerns. By contrast, South Africa raised its policy rate in November 2015 and January 2016 to curb inflationary pressures. Brazil and Russia continue to maintain high policy rates despite recession, as inflationary pressures remain elevated by large currency depreciation. Some Latin American countries such as Mexico, Chile and Colombia have been raising policy rates in response to currency depreciation, tracking in some measure the depreciation of the RMB (Chart V.6a and b). meeting. As concerns about China seemed to recede, markets rallied in October \u2013 globally, equity markets recorded modest gains, yields softened in debt markets, major currencies regained some ground against the US dollar and crude oil traded briefly above US$ 50 per barrel for the first time since July. Policy interventions in major EMEs and AEs, either through stepping up of monetary accommodation or intervention in foreign currency markets, also supported the markets. With a hawkish tone discernible in Fed\u2019s October meeting, both money and bond markets in the US reacted to heightened rate expectations that gained ground from November 2015. In the Euro area, however, market sentiment remained calm until December. Global financial markets began Q4 of 2015 on a positive note, with market sentiment boosted by the Fed refraining from raising policy rate in its September Since the beginning of 2016, fears about weakening global growth have re-emerged, especially about China. Combined with worries about financial viability of European banks and falling commodity prices, it triggered surges of volatility in financial markets and overshoots, with contagion spreading to financial markets across AEs and EMEs. A panel VAR using daily data of select EMEs for the period July 1, 2015 to February 25, 2016 - covering the two episodes of large devaluation in RMB in August 2015 and January 2016 - shows that devaluation of the RMB induces marked movement in the currency, bond and equity markets in the panel countries over the next two weeks.1 A one per cent depreciation in the RMB leads to a similar depreciation in the currencies of these countries, while the 10-year G-sec yield hardens and equity prices fall significantly (Chart V.7). Global equity markets dipped into \u2018bear\u2019 territory during January-February 2016, with equity prices retreating across all major markets. Bank equities, in particular, were hit hard in AEs and have fallen significantly since the beginning of the year - 21 per cent in the Euro area; 30 per cent in Japan; 19 per cent in the UK; and 12 per cent in the US. Equity markets also fell across EMEs in Q1 of 2016, but the declines were relatively modest (Chart V.8a). aggravated worries about global growth, and government bond yields fell into negative territory in some AEs. The introduction of a negative deposit rate by Japan pushed its 10-year bond yield into negative zone, which spurred demand for other positive yielding treasuries and depressed their yields. Global foreign exchange markets broadly tracked the equity markets, policy measures of central banks in systemically important economies and shifts in investors\u2019 risk assessments. The US dollar has generally strengthened, barring intermittent loss of ground on incoming data. Currency markets have reacted perversely to more recent unconventional monetary policy actions by the ECB and the BoJ, with appreciation in the euro and yen occurring immediately after policy announcements. Among EME currencies, a few currencies such as the Korean won, the Malaysian ringgit, the Thai Baht and the Indonesian rupiah appreciated in Q4 of 2015. By contrast, currencies such as the Brazilian real, the Russian ruble and the South African rand weakened due to lower commodity prices. Most EME currencies have steadied after losing ground in early part of Q1 of 2016 (Chart V.8b). In AE bond markets, yields rose in the last quarter of 2015 on the anticipated rate hike by the Fed and easing concerns about China. Net foreign portfolio flows to EME bond markets were mostly negative in Q4 which kept yield rates high. In Q1 of 2016, financial market turbulence and a further sharp fall in oil prices In sum, downside risks to global economic activity have increased. With global commodity prices and inflation expected to remain soft, monetary policy stances continue to be highly accommodative, but divergent. Financial markets remain vulnerable to volatility and flux in capital flows and investor sentiment. 1 PVAR Stata Package developed by Abrogo et al, (2015) was used with the number of lags set to three with standard Choleskey decomposition. The selected EMEs are Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, South Africa and Thailand. ", "file5": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.5 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); and continue to provide liquidity as required but progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system from one per cent of NDTL to a position closer to neutrality. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 7.0 per cent. Since the first bi-monthly statement of April 2016, global growth is uneven and 2. struggling to gain traction. World trade remains muted in an environment of weak demand. In the United States, growth was slow once again in Q1 because of contracting industrial activity and exports. Recent indicators of labour market activity have also weakened. In the Euro area, by contrast, Q1 GDP rose strongly on the back of robust consumer spending and recovering employment and business conditions. In Q2 so far, unemployment is falling, albeit slowly, and purchasing managers\u2019 sentiment is upbeat. In Japan, growth surprised on the upside in Q1, with the economy escaping a technical recession, but industrial activity remains weak and deflationary pressures are building. GDP growth slowed sequentially in China in Q1, with retail sales, industrial 3. production and fixed investment showing signs of weakness in recent months amidst still rising levels of indebtedness among households and corporations. While macroeconomic stability is returning to some emerging market economies (EMEs), geo-political tensions and high volatility in financial markets impede the resumption of momentum, and the outlook remains challenging. The recent uptick in commodity prices is providing some relief to commodity exporters but political events could unsettle investor sentiment and consequently, capital flows could turn volatile again. For commodity importers, net terms of trade gains are moderating. 4. Global financial markets have recorded gains through Q2 of 2016, spurred by risk-on investor sentiment. Portfolio flows are returning, albeit hesitantly, to EME debt and equity markets. The firmness in crude prices that set in around mid-March has been supported in subsequent weeks by some temporary reductions in global supply. Gold prices remain elevated on safe haven demand. Other non-energy commodity prices remain stable with a hint of upside, while steel prices have firmed appreciably. Bond market yields across AEs have eased steadily, reflecting strong appetite in primary auctions in the face of the growing universe of negative yielding bonds. The US dollar continues to mirror changes in expectations of monetary policy action by the Fed. The yen and the euro have remained strong despite ultra- accommodative monetary policies. Among EMEs, some currencies are trading with an appreciating bias, with the biggest gains recorded by the currencies that had depreciated the most earlier. 5. On the domestic front, the recently released provisional estimate of gross value added (GVA) for 2015-16 marginally scaled down the annual growth rate to 7.2 per cent, on a deceleration of services sector activity in relation to the advance estimates. There was, however, a sequential pickup in activity in Q4 in line with expectations. As regards the current financial year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast an above-normal and well-distributed south west monsoon as El Nino wanes \u2013 albeit with a slightly delayed onset. Realisation of this prediction is critical for the outlook for agriculture since reservoir levels have been depleted to 17 per cent of capacity \u2013 40 per cent lower than the level a year ago. Even though rabi procurement was lower in April-May 2016 than a year ago, mid- May food stocks at 58 million tonnes were almost three times the norm for Q1. The index of industrial production decelerated in 2015-16, mainly pulled down 6. by weak manufacturing in an environment of subdued investment demand and weak rural consumption. In May 2016, the manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) remained subdued on account of slowing output and export orders. However, except for natural gas and crude oil, the core sector registered strong growth in April 2016 on account of a seasonal pick-up in industries like electricity, also supported by a low base. There are signs that corporate performance is improving. Available information on Q4 earnings suggests double digit growth in EBITDA levels for non- financial corporates. The Reserve Bank\u2019s latest rounds of forward looking surveys indicate an improvement in the overall business situation, driven by a pick-up in capacity utilisation and in order books \u2013 both domestic and external. These developments have improved the expectation of business conditions in the first half of 2016-17. Public investment, especially in roads and railways, is gaining strength, though the continuing weakness in private investment is of concern. Demand conditions are likely to improve going forward; consumer confidence is seen as rising on improving expectations of employment and spending, with rural demand aided by a stronger monsoon. Rising capacity utilisation should prompt private investment. 7. Some high frequency indicators for April point to a firming recovery, although it is still uneven. Leading the upturn are cargo traffic at major ports, automobile sales (especially two-wheelers and three-wheelers), commercial vehicle sales, passenger air and freight traffic, cement production and steel consumption. Abstracting from seasonal effects, this suggests that the expansion, especially in the service sector, is getting broad-based. On the other hand, railway freight traffic and passenger car sales have decelerated on sector-specific constraints. Purchasing managers in the services sector indicated slowing new business in May and subdued expectations of future activity. 8. The ebbing of inflation pressures for two consecutive months to March, after a period of steady rise, was interrupted once again in April. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) rose more sharply than expected due to a more-than- seasonal jump in food prices. Within the food group, inflation in respect of vegetables, fruits, sugar, meat and fish rose sizably from their prints in the previous month. Inflation in respect of pulses remained elevated; the recent decline in prices of pulses reversed, yielding a sharp increase in April. Production of pulses has fallen for the second consecutive year, according to the third advance estimates for 2015-16. There was also a firming of inflation relating to edible oils, spices and non-alcoholic beverages. Cereal reflecting supply management efforts that expanded offtake from food stocks. Inflation in respect of the fuel group eased mainly due to firewood and stronger deflation in respect of LPG prices. Reflecting these recent inflation dynamics, three-months-ahead inflation expectations of households moved up marginally in May. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel edged up in April, driven by prices of 9. petrol and diesel embedded in transport and communication. Clothing and footwear also registered moderate increases in inflation. Services inflation remained elevated on account of house rents, water charges, tuition fees and taxi/auto fares. Excluding petrol and diesel from this category, inflation was sticky and above 5 per cent. However, since growth in rural wages and corporate staff costs have been modest, cost-push factors may be subdued for the time being. 10. Despite the waning of liquidity pressures in early April, stronger-than-usual currency demand during the first two months of the financial year and build-up of cash balances by the Government from the second week of May tightened liquidity conditions from mid-May. In order to mitigate these pressures, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity through purchases under open market operations (OMOs) of 700 billion during April-May in pursuance of the revised liquidity management framework outlined in the April bi-monthly policy statement. Additionally, liquidity was injected through variable rate repos of various tenors, in addition to the regular 14-day term repos and overnight fixed rate repo and MSF. The average daily net liquidity injection through the liquidity adjustment facility (including MSF) declined from 1935 billion in March 2016 to 1030 billion during April-May and further to 120 billion in June (up to June 5, 2016). The weighted average call money rate (WACR) remained closely anchored to the policy rate within a narrower corridor of +/- 50 basis points around the policy repo rate. Volatility also declined significantly. Interest rates on money market instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercial paper (CPs) also eased through the quarter so far. 11. Exports declined for the seventeenth consecutive month in April in US dollar terms in spite of a modest increase in volume. The fall in crude oil prices led to lower export realisations from petroleum products (POL), although the volume of shipments of petroleum products is estimated to have picked up modestly. Among non-oil items, exports of gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, chemicals and electronic goods improved over their levels a year ago. By contrast, exports of engineering goods declined for the ninth straight month while readymade garments recorded a fall for the fourth successive month. Imports fell sharply and across constituents \u2013 25 items accounting for a share of 87 per cent in total imports recorded a decline; POL imports also declined, essentially reflecting lower prices. Accordingly, the trade deficit narrowed sequentially and was less than half its level a year ago. Portfolio flows resumed in April and May. The level of foreign exchange reserves rose to US $ 360 billion by May 27, 2016. 12. The inflation surprise in the April reading makes the future trajectory of inflation somewhat more uncertain. The expectations of a normal monsoon and a reasonable spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, along with various supply management measures and the introduction of the electronic national agriculture market (e-NAM) trading portal, should moderate unanticipated flares of food inflation. In addition, capacity utilisation indicators suggest that the available headroom in industry could keep output prices subdued even as demand picks up. Nonetheless, there are upside risks \u2013 firming international commodity prices, particularly of crude oil; the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission awards which will have to be factored into projections as soon as clarity on implementation emerges; the upturn in inflation expectations of households and of corporates; and the stickiness in inflation excluding food and fuel. Taking these factors into account, the inflation projections given in the April policy statement are retained, though with an upside bias. Considerable uncertainty surrounds these projections (Chart 1), which should be clarified by incoming data in the next few months. 13. Domestic conditions for growth are improving gradually, mainly driven by consumption demand, which is expected to strengthen with a normal monsoon and the implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission award. Higher public sector capital expenditure, led by roads and railways, should crowd in private investment, offsetting somewhat the subdued appetite for fresh private investment due to financial stress. Yet, business confidence will be restrained to an extent on account of unrelenting global factors. On a reassessment of balance of risks, therefore, the GVA growth projection for 2016-17 has been retained at 7.6 per cent with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). 14. In its bi-monthly monetary policy statement of April 2016, the Reserve Bank stated that it would watch macroeconomic and financial developments in the months ahead with a view to responding as space opens up. Incoming data since then show a sharper-than-anticipated upsurge in inflationary pressures emanating from a number of food items (beyond seasonal effects), as well as a reversal in commodity prices. A strong monsoon, continued astute food management, as well as steady expansion in supply capacity, especially in services, could help offset these upward pressures. Given the uncertainties, the Reserve Bank will stay on hold, but the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. The Reserve Bank will monitor macroeconomic and financial developments for any further scope for policy action. 15. More monetary transmission to support the revival of growth continues to be critical. The government\u2019s reform measures on small savings rates combined with the Reserve Bank\u2019s refinements in the liquidity management framework should help the transmission of past policy rate reductions into lending rates of banks. The Reserve Bank will shortly review the implementation of the Marginal Cost Lending Rate framework by banks. Timely capital infusions into constrained public sector banks will also aid credit flow. The third bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on August 16. 9, 2016. ", "file6": "On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.5 per cent; keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL); and continue to provide liquidity as required but progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system from one per cent of NDTL to a position closer to neutrality. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 7.0 per cent. 2. Since the second bi-monthly statement of June 2016, several developments have clouded the outlook for the global economy. Across advanced economies (AEs), growth in Q2 of 2016 has been slower than anticipated, and the outlook is still mixed. Headwinds in the United States from declining inventory investment were offset somewhat by strong payroll numbers. In the Euro area, the re-emergence of stress in some parts of the banking sector and the Brexit vote increased uncertainty. In Japan, downside risks have intensified in the form of a stronger yen, deflationary risks and contracting industrial production, triggering monetary and fiscal stimuli. Among emerging market economies, activity remains varied. GDP growth 3. stabilised in China in Q2, on the back of strong stimulus. Manufacturing activity was weak in July due to adverse weather and subdued export demand, although smaller firms recorded an uptick in new orders. Recessionary conditions are gradually diminishing in Brazil and Russia, but the near-term outlook is still fragile due to policy uncertainties and soft commodity prices. 4. World trade remains sluggish in the first half of 2016. International financial markets did not anticipate the Brexit vote and equities plunged worldwide, currency volatility increased and investors herded into safe havens. Since then, however, equity markets have regained lost ground. Currencies, barring the pound sterling, have stabilised, with the yen appreciating the most on risk-on demand as well as the announcement of fresh stimulus. Yields on government bonds have fallen further and the universe of negative yielding assets is expanding at a fast pace, reflecting high risk aversion and expectations of further monetary accommodation by systemic central banks. Crude prices, which had risen to an intra-year high in May on supply disruptions, remain volatile. Other commodity prices, barring those of precious metals, remain soft due to weak demand. On the domestic front, several factors are helping to support the recovery. 5. After a delayed onset, the south west monsoon picked up vigorously from the third week of June. By early August, the cumulative rainfall was 3 per cent higher than the long period average, with more than 80 per cent of the country receiving normal to excess precipitation. Kharif sowing strengthened after a lacklustre start, particularly with respect to pulses. Barring cotton, jute and mesta, sowing of all crops is currently above last year\u2019s acreage. These developments engender greater confidence about the near-term outlook for value added in agriculture. The target for kharif production set by the Ministry of Agriculture appears within reach. 6. Industrial production picked up in May on the back of manufacturing and mining, following a contraction in the preceding month. The uneven performance of industrial output reflects the lumpy and order-driven contraction of insulated rubber cables, a component of capital goods. Excluding this item, industrial production rose at 3.0 per cent in the current financial year. In fact, capital goods production excluding insulated rubber cables expanded by 8.0 per cent. Nonetheless, the prolonged sluggishness in the capital goods sector is indicative of weak investment demand. The rate of contraction in consumer non-durables slowed, pointing to some revival in rural demand. On the other hand, the pace of growth of consumer durables has been stable and buoyed by urban consumption demand, although it eased in May on base effects. Barring the contraction in natural gas and crude oil on account of structural bottlenecks, the core sector has been resilient as of 2016-17 so far, and should support industrial activity going forward. There are some signs of green shoots in manufacturing too, with purchasing managers and the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey indicating a pick-up in new orders, both domestic and external. Business confidence is also looking up in recent months, though the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey for March 2016 suggests that capacity utilisation, seasonally adjusted, is still weak. Service sector purchasing managers polled the thirteenth successive month 7. of expansion in July on the basis of a sharp acceleration in new business. Business expectations remained optimistic on better economic conditions and planned increases in marketing budgets. High frequency indicators of service sector activity are still, however, emitting mixed signals, although a larger number of indicators are in acceleration mode in Q1 of 2016-17 than in the preceding quarter. Automobile sales across most segments, railway, port and international air freight traffic, foreign tourist arrivals, and domestic air passenger traffic are providing the underlying momentum for the upturn. The gradual improvement in the services sector is getting broad-based. Retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose to 8. a 22-month high in June, with a sharp pick-up in momentum overwhelming favourable base effects. The rise was mainly driven by food, with vegetable inflation higher than the usual seasonal rise at this time of the year. Sugar prices also firmed up due to a decline in domestic production after two successive years of drought. While pulses inflation started moderating, prices of pulses have been rising again since April after a short-lived correction in the previous quarter. Inflation pressures are also incipient in cereals. These developments fed through into households\u2019 inflation expectations three months ahead, reversing the decline seen in the last two quarters. 9. Fuel inflation remained subdued, mainly due to sustained deflation in prices of liquefied petroleum gas. Excluding food and fuel, inflation eased across major sub- groups. Further excluding petrol and diesel from transport, inflation fell below 5 per cent for the first time since the introduction of the combined CPI. Softer inflation readings were recorded across services constituents in health, education, personal care and effects, and other categories of household consumption. Rural wage growth has been rising albeit moderately, driven up by wages of agricultural labourers. On the other hand, staff costs in the organised sector were relatively restrained. 10. Liquidity conditions eased significantly during June and July on the back of increased spending by the Government which more than offset the reduction in market liquidity because of higher-than-usual currency demand. The injection of through purchases under open market operations (OMOs), durable amounting to 805 billion so far, also helped in easing liquidity conditions, bringing the system-level ex ante liquidity deficit to close to neutrality (albeit without seasonal adjustment). Accordingly, the average daily liquidity operation switched from net injection of liquidity of 141 billion in July and 405 billion in August (up to August 8). The Reserve Bank conducted variable rate repos and reverse repos of varying tenors in order to manage evolving liquidity conditions, with a more active use of reverse repos to manage the surplus liquidity. Reflecting the easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (WACR) and money market weighted average rate remained on average 15 basis points below the policy repo rate since June. Interest rates on other money market instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercial paper (CPs) have also declined in both the primary and secondary markets. 370 billion in June to net absorption of 11. In the external sector, merchandise export growth moved into positive territory in June after eighteen months. This upturn was reasonably widespread, covering chemicals, marine products, handicraft, plastic, rice, electronic and engineering goods. On the other hand, imports continued to decline, albeit at a slower pace than in recent months. While lower crude oil prices continued to compress the POL import bill, domestic demand for gold remained muted, with domestic gold prices trading at a discount vis-a-vis international prices. Non-oil non-gold imports continued to shrink, pulled down by coal, fertilisers, ores, iron and steel and machinery and transport equipment. Cumulatively, the trade deficit narrowed in Q1 of 2016-17 on a year-on- year basis. Net receipts on account of services remained flat in April-May 2016, with net outflow under communication services and sluggish software earnings. While the pace of foreign direct investment inflows slowed in the first two months of 2016-17, net portfolio flows were stronger after the Brexit vote, notwithstanding considerable volatility characterising these flows. The level of foreign exchange reserves rose to US$ 365.7 billion by August 5, 2016. 12. The recent sharper-than-anticipated increase in food prices has pushed up the projected trajectory of inflation over the rest of the year. Moreover, prices of pulses and cereals are rising and services inflation remains somewhat sticky. There are early indications, however, that prices of vegetables are edging down. Going forward, the strong improvement in sowing on the back of the monsoon\u2019s steady progress, along with supply management measures, augers well for the food inflation outlook. The prospects for inflation excluding food and fuel are more uncertain; if the current softness in crude prices proves to be transient and as the output gap continues to close, inflation excluding food and fuel may likely trend upwards and counterbalance the benefit of the expected easing of food inflation. In addition, the full implementation of the recommendations of the 7th central pay commission (CPC) on allowances will affect the magnitude of the direct effect of house rents on the CPI. On balance, inflation projections as given in the June bi-monthly statement, i.e. of a central trajectory towards 5 per cent by March 2017 with risks tilted to the upside, are retained (Chart 1). 13. Looking ahead, the momentum of growth is expected to be quickened by the normal monsoon raising agricultural growth and rural demand, as well as by the stimulus to consumption spending that can be expected from the disbursement of pay, pension and arrears following the implementation of the 7th CPC\u2019s award. The passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill augurs well for the growing political consensus for economic reforms. While timely implementation of GST will be challenging, there is no doubt that it should raise returns to investment across much of the economy, even while strengthening government finances over the medium- term. This should boost business sentiment and eventually investment. The current accommodative stance of monetary policy and comfortable liquidity conditions should also provide a congenial environment for the reinvigoration of aggregate demand conditions. However, successive downgrades of global growth projections by multilateral agencies and the continuing sluggishness in world trade points to further slackening of external demand going forward. Accordingly, the GVA growth projection for 2016-17 is retained at 7.6 per cent, with risks facing the economy at this juncture evenly balanced around it (Chart 2). 14. Risks to the inflation target of 5 per cent for March 2017 continue to be on the upside. Furthermore, while the direct statistical effect of house rent allowances under the 7th CPC\u2019s award may be looked through, its impact on inflation expectations will have to be carefully monitored so as to pre-empt a generalisation of inflation pressures. In terms of immediate outcomes, much will depend on the benign effects of the monsoon on food prices. 15. In view of this configuration of risks, it is appropriate for the Reserve Bank to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at this juncture, while awaiting space for policy action. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and will continue to emphasise the adequate provision of liquidity. Easy liquidity conditions are already prompting banks to modestly transmit past policy rate cuts through their MCLRs and pro-active liquidity management should facilitate more pass-through. 16. It may be recalled that the refinements to the liquidity management framework effected in April 2016 were intended to smooth the supply of durable liquidity over the year using asset purchases and sales as needed, and progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system to a position closer to neutrality. The Reserve Bank intends to continue with this strategy, with the intention of closing the underlying liquidity deficit over time so that the system moves to a position of structural balance. As regards imminent FCNR(B) redemptions, the Reserve Bank has been frontloading liquidity provision through open market operations and spot interventions/deliveries of forward purchases. The Reserve Bank will continue with both domestic liquidity operations and foreign exchange interventions that should also enable management of the FCNR(B) redemptions without market disruptions. With a view to further front-loading the provision of liquidity, it has been decided to conduct an open market purchase auction on August 11, 2016. Details are being announced separately. The fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on 17. October 4, 2016.

Amendments to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, which came into force on June 27, 2016 will empower the conduct of monetary policy in India. For the \ufb01 rst time in its history, the RBI has been explicitly provided the legislative mandate to operate the monetary policy framework of the country. The primary objective of monetary policy has also been de\ufb01 ned explicitly for the \ufb01 rst time \u2013 \u201cto maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth.\u201d The amendments also provide for the constitution of a monetary policy committee (MPC) that shall determine the policy rate required to achieve the in\ufb02 ation target, another landmark in India\u2019s monetary history. The composition of the MPC, terms of appointment, information \ufb02 ows and other procedural requirements such as implementation of and publication of its decisions, and failure to maintain the in\ufb02 ation target as well as remedial actions have been speci\ufb01 ed and subsequently gazetted. On August 5, 2016 the Government set out the in\ufb02 ation target as four per cent with upper and lower tolerance levels of six per cent and two per cent, respectively. Notes: (a) : In\ufb02 ation Report press conference. (b) : Governor\u2019s speech/presentation at the brie\ufb01 ng on the In\ufb02 ation Report. (c) : Presentation by central bank director at the quarterly In\ufb02 ation Report. Source: Central Bank websites. The Government and the RBI have constituted the six member MPC. All conditions are, therefore, in place for the MPC to take its \ufb01 rst decision on October 4 under the Reserve Bank\u2019s fourth bi-monthly monetary policy review for 2016-17. The amended RBI Act establishes the procedures for MPC meetings. It speci\ufb01 cally lays down that the Bank shall organise at least four meetings of the MPC in a year (Section 45ZI). The cross-country experience in this regard is varied, both in terms of the number of meetings and the press conferences that usually follow the meetings in order to explain the stance of monetary policy for the bene\ufb01 t of the public. A survey of country practices suggests a central tendency among major central banks to hold four press conferences a year, although the number of MPC meetings may be higher (Table I.1). Chapters II and III compare in\ufb02 ation and growth outcomes with the April 2016 forecasts and drill down into factors underlying deviations. Turning to the outlook, the April 2016 monetary policy report (MPR) presaged the continuing weakening of global growth and external demand. At the September G20 Summit in Hangzhou, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned about an even more modest pace of global growth this year, with the balance of risks remaining skewed to the downside (Chart I.1). This will necessitate an adjustment to assumptions on initial conditions for the projections given in this MPR. Furthermore, international crude oil prices, which fell to a recent trough in early April, have been edging up in ensuing months and the slightly \ufb01 rmer note in these prices observed since July will need to be factored into the assumptions (Table 1.2). International petroleum product price benchmarks used by domestic oil marketing companies (OMCs) to set domestic pump prices of petrol and diesel at fortnightly intervals tend to be highly correlated with international crude prices (0.9).

Of every one per cent change in international product prices (lagged by a fortnight to simulate pump price revisions in India), only 0.31 per cent is re\ufb02 ected in domestic pump prices of petrol, the pass-through increasing to 0.42 per cent during episodes of international price increases and falling to 0.28 per cent during international price declines (Chart I.2; see also Chapter II). In 2016 so far, however, a substantially higher degree of pass-through is being observed. Daily price collections of sensitive items under pulses, fruits, vegetables and cereals suggest that the seasonal surge in food prices may have peaked in July. Subdued momentum in food in\ufb02 ation in Q3 and the usual seasonal softening of food prices in early Q4, notwithstanding a reversal of base effects in March 2017, improves the near-term outlook for in\ufb02 ation considerably. Commodity prices are expected to remain quiescent over the rest of the year. These anticipated developments feed into in\ufb02 ation expectations and, in turn, in\ufb02 uence wage and price conditions, going forward. Among various economic agents, households tend to be the most adaptive in their expectations formation. Accordingly, food price increases of May-July appear to have remained entrenched in their in\ufb02 ation expectations. The September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of urban households indicates a pick- up in their current perceptions and expectations of in\ufb02 ation farther out, as in the June round of the survey, with an increase in the proportion of respondents expecting prices to rise by more than the current rate1 (Chart I.3). In the September round, in fact, in\ufb02 ation is expected to be 9.5 per cent three months ahead and 11.4 per cent one year ahead. By contrast, producers\u2019 in\ufb02 ation expectations appear to be more forward-looking. The July-September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey2 reveals an increase in the proportion of respondents expecting higher input prices in Q3. The survey also indicates a decline in their expectations of higher selling prices (Chart I.4). Expectations of improvement in demand conditions should be comfortably absorbed by the presence of spare capacity. Manufacturing purchasing managers polled in Nikkei\u2019s survey for September 2016 indicate that, despite some uptick, both input and output price indices were lower than their long-term averages. Increases in staff costs in 1 The survey was conducted in 18 cities and covered 5,300 urban households. 2 The survey covered responses from 723 manufacturing companies. the organised sector as well as nominal rural wage growth \u2013 especially with the deceleration in July \u2013 are expected to remain moderate in Q3. The September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of professional forecasters indicates a greater degree of anchoring of their in\ufb02 ation expectations, relative to other agents, around the Reserve Bank\u2019s in\ufb02 ation targets (Chart I.5). They expect in\ufb02 ation to ease to 4.7 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 and to 4.4 per cent by Q2 of 2017-18, both lying within the Reserve Bank\u2019s in\ufb02 ation target band. While their medium- term in\ufb02 ation expectations (\ufb01 ve years ahead) have remained unchanged at 5 per cent, their longer- term expectations (10 years ahead) have moved down to 4.5 per cent from 4.8 per cent polled in the immediately preceding round of the survey. These expectations re\ufb02 ect the stubborn persistence that may be encountered in moving below current levels of in\ufb02 ation. Staff\u2019s baseline model forecasts, taking into account the revisions in assumptions on initial conditions and augmented by information yielded by these forward- looking surveys of various classes of economic agents as well as from lead indicators, set a trajectory that takes consumer price index (CPI) in\ufb02 ation down from 5.7 per cent in Q1 of 2016-17 to 5.0 per cent in Q3 before it \ufb01 rms up moderately to 5.3 per cent in Q4 (the 70 per cent con\ufb01 dence interval lies in a range of 3.9-7.0 per cent) (Chart I.6). These projections incorporate the 7th pay commission\u2019s award relating to salaries and pensions which will work through aggregate demand and expectations effects to add around 10 basis points (bps) to the baseline path from Q4 of 2016-17. Furthermore, the projections also factor in cost-push effects of the proposed increase in minimum wages which would add 5 bps to baseline in\ufb02 ation within two months of implementation3. Taking into account these shocks to the baseline and given the initial conditions in Table I.2, staff projects in\ufb02 ation to ease modestly through 2017-18 and reach 3 The Union Government\u2019s proposal to revise basic minimum wages, including Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA), for different categories of employees would raise basic minimum wages in the range of `198-453, which works to an overall increase of 42 per cent. The increase in basic minimum wages will also have some impact on rural wages. 4.5 per cent by Q4 of 2017-18 (2.1 per cent to 7.7 per cent de\ufb01 ning the 70 per cent con\ufb01 dence interval). By current reckoning, the pass-through of the goods and services tax (GST) will likely commence from April 2017 and last for about 12-18 months, going by the cross-country experience. While the impact of the GST on CPI in\ufb02 ation would largely depend on the standard rate decided by the GST Council, almost 50 per cent of the CPI is expected to be exempt. Cross-country experience indicates that the GST implementation might have one-off effects, which tend to dissipate after a year of its implementation (see Chapter II). It is in the context of unanticipated shocks to the future evolution of in\ufb02 ation that the rationale of setting India\u2019s in\ufb02 ation target at 4 per cent with a tolerance band of +/- 2 per cent can be appreciated. Globally too, the subject of the appropriate level of the in\ufb02 ation target is being intensely debated. For advanced economies, the wide-spread practice of a 2 per cent in\ufb02 ation target has come under considerable scrutiny in the aftermath of the global \ufb01 nancial crisis. The crisis showed that large adverse shocks can and do happen and when they do, policymakers need room for monetary policy to react to them, especially when the longer-term prospects of the economy are jeopardised. Accordingly, a view has been expressed that they should aim for a higher in\ufb02 ation target of say 4 per cent since the costs of in\ufb02 ation at 4 per cent and/or of anchoring expectations at 4 per cent are judged to be lower than the bene\ufb01 ts of headroom made available to monetary policy to stabilise the economy in the face of recession risks. More recently, the potential bene\ufb01 ts of a higher in\ufb02 ation target have been cited in the context of the secular decline in the natural/neutral rate of interest (Williams, 20164)5. The April 2016 MPR had outlined the key downside risks that could impinge upon the path of growth in 2016-17 \u2013 the depressed private investment climate amidst subdued capacity utilisation and corporate balance sheet deleveraging; depressed global output and trade growth dragging down net exports. It also highlighted several positive factors that could potentially lift growth, including the government\u2019s \u201cstart-up\u201d and other initiatives, the boost to household consumption demand from the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award, still benign cost conditions, measures announced in the Union Budget 2016- 17 to transform the rural sector, upbeat consumer con\ufb01 dence and the expected recovery in agriculture and allied activities. Since then, some of these assumptions have materialised. Accordingly, the spatially and temporally satisfactory south-west monsoon during the 2016 season, and the implementation of the 7th CPC award are expected to provide a boost to consumption spending, both rural and urban. The Reserve Bank\u2019s survey conducted in August-September 2016 found consumer optimism on the general economic outlook, but somewhat less con\ufb01 dence on future income and employment6 (Chart I.7). While private investment activity remains sluggish, corporate business expectations remain upbeat in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey on improving prospects capacity utilisation, employment and the availability of \ufb01 nance (Chart I.8). This positive sentiment was also re\ufb02 ected in business con\ufb01 dence surveys conducted by other institutions (Table I.3). 4 Williams, John (2016), \u201cWhither In\ufb02 ation Targeting?\u201d, available at http:// www.frbsf.org 5 In fact, the debate has led up to the question of the appositeness of the Fed adopting India\u2019s in\ufb02 ation target (The Economist, August 27, 2016)! A 4 per cent in\ufb02 ation target is not unusual outside the advanced country context: Indonesia ( 4+/-1 per cent); Russia (4 per cent for 2017); Brazil (4.5 +/- 2 per cent). 6 Based on the Reserve Bank\u2019s Consumer Con\ufb01 dence Survey covering around 5,000 respondents in six metropolitan cities. Over the medium-term, the implementation of the GST should boost business con\ufb01 dence and investment, brightening the environment for an acceleration of growth. Other initiatives such as steps to attract foreign direct investment in defence, civil aviation, pharmaceuticals and broadcasting, measures to improve infrastructure, and the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act should also contribute to unlocking entrepreneurial energies and growth impulses. 3.0* : Variation over August 2015 survey. Professional forecasters surveyed during September 2016 expected real GVA growth to improve from 7.3 per cent in 2016-17:Q1 to 7.6 per cent each in the remaining three quarters of 2016-17 on account of better agricultural prospects (Chart I.9 and Table I.4). Taking into account these developments in conjunction with signals from various surveys and indicators and updated model forecasts, staff retains the projection of real GVA growth at 7.6 per cent for 2016-17, with a range of 7.6-7.7 per cent in Q2-Q4 (Chart I.10).

Moreover, lags in data releases challenge the assessment of underlying economic conditions. Illustratively, the latest data on GDP, which became available on August 31, 2016 pertain to April-June 2016; GDP data for the quarter July-September 2016 \u2013 the quarter that is most relevant to this MPR as a starting point \u2013 will be released at the end of November 2016. Therefore, timely and accurate projections of these key goal variables are important. As noted in the MPR of September 2015, the Reserve Bank deploys a host of modelling approaches for generating forecasts. It also scans a host of incoming data to \u201cnowcast\u201d the current state of the economy. The \u201cnowcasting\u201d process involves analysing a number of leading and concurrent indicators of economic activity through a dynamic factor model (DFM) to estimate GVA growth for the relevant quarter, as well as the immediately preceding and following quarters. With an initial input of around 47 variables, the DFM exploits the co-movement among the series to select a relatively few salient \u2018factors\u2019. Given that data releases are scattered over the course of a month, the nowcast is updated as soon as new information comes in, thus providing an assessment of the economy almost in real time. The nowcasting of India\u2019s GVA employs not only coincident and lead indicators but also survey results. Chart A presents nowcasts at the end of the relevant quarter - for example, the nowcast for the quarter January-March 2016 is based on information up to end-March. Chart B evaluates nowcasting performance over alternative horizons (from 2 months before the end of the reference quarter to one month after the reference quarter), and indicates an improvement in model performance as more information becomes available. The model performs better than a benchmark random walk (RW) model. Nonetheless, there are formidable challenges to nowcasting performance from the data \u2013 the persisting wide wedge between growth in industrial production and the growth in GVA in the manufacturing sector necessitates off-model adjustments to the results. Reference: retained, but with downside risks mainly due to lower global demand vis-\u00e0-vis the April MPR. While the second round impact of the 7th CPC award in the form of salaries and pensions is incorporated in the baseline forecasts, the effect of house rent allowances (HRA) is not, since its implementation was deferred, pending a review. As and when the revised allowances are awarded, they will have a direct impact on headline CPI in\ufb02 ation through an increase in housing in\ufb02 ation (house rents have a weight of 9.5 per cent in the CPI). In addition, indirect effects could arise through in\ufb02 ation expectations. Assuming that (a) the revised allowances are implemented from early 2017, (b) the increase proposed by the 7th CPC is retained7, and (c) state governments implement a similar order of increase in allowances with a lag of 7 The 7th CPC recommended an HRA increase of 8-24 per cent of the basic pay. one quarter, headline CPI in\ufb02 ation in 2017-18 could be 100-150 bps above the baseline. The impact on in\ufb02 ation is expected to persist for 6-8 quarters, with the peak effect occurring at around 3-4 quarters following the implementation (Chart I.11). While for policy purposes, the statistical direct effects of the increase in HRA should be looked through since they do not constitute an increase in true in\ufb02 ation, model simulations indicate that indirect effects arising out of aggregate demand effects and rise in in\ufb02 ation expectations may require a tightening of the monetary policy stance to ensure that in\ufb02 ationary pressures from this factor do not get generalised and entrenched into expectations. A striking characteristic of food in\ufb02 ation in recent years has been its persistence in certain groups such as pulses. In turn, this characteristic imparts stickiness to overall in\ufb02 ation formation. Pulses, which have a weight of just 2.4 per cent in the CPI, have accounted for around 12-20 per cent of overall in\ufb02 ation since mid-2015, manifesting structural demand supply imbalances rather than transient mismatches. Several initiatives have been undertaken over the past year to augment supply and bring down pulses in\ufb02 ation (see Chapter II). If these efforts are able to bring down the prices of pulses on a sustained basis, food in\ufb02 ation could ebb by around 35 bps by 2016-17:Q4 and around 100 bps by 2017-18:Q4 and, through a process of relative price adjustments, overall in\ufb02 ation could moderate by 15 bps in 2016-17:Q4 and 50 bps by 2017-18:Q4. Uncertainty prevailing about the pace of US monetary policy normalisation tends to get ampli\ufb01 ed by every incoming data. The outcome of the US presidential election also adds to uncertainty. Consequently, spillovers purvey volatility to global and domestic \ufb01 nancial markets, especially in the foreign exchange, equity and debt segments, with implications for domestic in\ufb02 ation and growth. A \ufb01 ve per cent depreciation of the Indian rupee vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar could increase in\ufb02 ation by 10-15 bps and real GVA growth by 5-10 bps above the baseline through effects on net exports (Charts I.11 and I.12). Model simulations that incorporate the resulting rise in headline in\ufb02 ation above the baseline path and a faster closing of the output gap could indicate monetary policy tightening. On the other hand, India could become a preferred destination of capital \ufb02 ows, as is the case currently, in view of relatively stronger macroeconomic fundamentals. This may cause the rupee to appreciate. An appreciation of the rupee by 5 per cent could moderate in\ufb02 ation by around 10-15 bps and real GVA growth by 10 bps below the baseline. International crude oil prices have remained volatile in recent months. The price of the Indian basket increased from around US$ 36 per barrel in March 2016 to US$ 47 in July before softening again to around US$ 44 in August-September. Consequently, the baseline assumption in Table I.2 could be subject to variations on either side. If crude oil prices increase to US$ 70 per barrel by the end of 2017-18 (higher by around 40 per cent than the baseline assumption), in\ufb02 ation could be higher by about 40-60 bps, while real GVA growth could weaken by around 20 bps relative to baseline paths by March 2018. Returning the goal variables to their baseline trajectories would require monetary policy tightening. On the other hand, crude prices could also soften below the baseline assumption in an event of weaker than expected global demand, and/or excess supply of crude in global markets. If crude oil prices fall to around US$ 35 per barrel and this softening is passed on to pump prices of petroleum products in India, in\ufb02 ation may be about 30-50 bps below its baseline, while real GVA growth could be around 15 bps above its baseline. Global growth has been muted so far and projections by various agencies for this year and the next are expected to downgrade the outlook for global growth even further. The uncertainty associated with the \u201cBrexit\u201d, the US presidential election and the still nebulous effects of US monetary policy normalisation and Chinese re-balancing, could undermine global economic activity even more. Should global growth be one percentage point below the assumed baseline, domestic real GVA growth and in\ufb02 ation could be 20- 40 bps and 10-20 bps below their respective baseline forecasts. The near-term outlook for the Indian economy is characterised by a continuing slow recovery, underpinned by consumption spending and by public investment at the margin. As regards in\ufb02 ation, the outlook has improved for 2016-17, but beyond, the prospects of reaching 4 per cent i.e., the centre of the target band requires close monitoring. Recent initiatives and reforms by the government such as \u2018Make in India\u2019, measures to improve the infrastructure, the scheduled introduction of the GST, improvements in food supply management and steps to enhance domestic production of fertilisers as well as a reduction in prices of non-urea fertilisers are expected to help disin\ufb02 ate in the medium-term. Even as the urgency of safeguarding near-term growth and stability has increased, the policy challenge is to bolster medium-term growth prospects through structural reforms that step up new investment in the economy on a sustained basis, renew skills and job creation, and broaden the swathe of the growth process to include the widest sections of society in its bene\ufb01 ts. Globally, the danger of secular stagnation and an entrenchment of lastingly impaired potential output have become more tangible than before. Besides the main priority of lifting both actual and potential output, keeping \ufb01 nancial stability risks in check, containing external vulnerabilities, and building resilience is essential if an adjustment to diminished growth prospects globally becomes inevitable. Consumer price inflation was pushed up by a surge in the momentum of food inflation during April-July 2016 before a sharp correction set in during August. Input costs firmed up moderately for both farm and non-farm sectors alongside corporate staff costs. Drawing on a modest softening of households\u2019 and professional forecasters\u2019 in\ufb02 ation expectations, still muted corporate pricing power and model forecasts, the April 2016 MPR envisaged a trajectory on which headline CPI in\ufb02 ation1 would edge down from 5.4 per cent in Q4 of 2015-16 to 5.3 per cent in Q1 of 2016-17 and to 5.1 per cent in Q2. In the event, the momentum of the seasonal \ufb01 rming up of food prices that usually sets in from April was much stronger than anticipated, especially in vegetables prices. Moreover, occurring as it did on top of highly elevated prices of pulses, it imparted an unusual upside to in\ufb02 ation that lasted right up to July. In addition, international crude prices rose from a recent trough in April to US$ 44 per barrel by September. Crude prices averaged US$ 44 per barrel during April-September as against US$ 40 per barrel in the assumptions on initial conditions in the April 2016 MPR. Consequently, headline CPI in\ufb02 ation averaged higher at 5.7 per cent in Q1 of 2016-17, deviating from the forecast of 5.3 per cent (Chart II.1). With the rapid waning of these transient price pressures in August, in\ufb02 ation momentum collapsed. In\ufb02 ation appears to be returning to the April 2016 forecast path, albeit from some elevation. A one percentage point deviation of food in\ufb02 ation from its trajectory projected in the April MPR leads to 47 basis points increase in headline in\ufb02 ation in terms of the direct effect alone and this perturbation could cause headline in\ufb02 ation to diverge from its projected path for upto four to six months, based on impulse responses in an unrestricted vector autoregression (VAR) framework. This imparts a modest potential upside to the balance of risks around the target of 5 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17. The April 2016 projections were predicated on the presence of favourable base effects arising from high in\ufb02 ation a year ago, with the base effects for food in\ufb02 ation stronger than those pulling down the headline. Even while the downside base effects were signi\ufb01 cant up to June-July, they were overwhelmed by a surge in the month-on-month (m-o-m) momentum \u2013 especially of food prices \u2013 which peaked in July. As surprisingly as it took hold, the momentum of headline CPI dissipated completely in August, with the momentum of food prices turning negative. With this unexpected reversal, sizable base effects in that month came into full play and pulled down overall in\ufb02 ation to 5.05 per cent, an intra-year low, in August (Charts II.2 and II.3). 1 Headline in\ufb02 ation is measured by year-on-year changes in all-India CPI Combined (Rural+Urban). The transient upsurge in in\ufb02 ation momentum in April-July was induced by two main drivers \u2013 pulses and vegetables \u2013 as evident in the strong positive skew of the distribution of in\ufb02 ation (Chart II.4). This is corroborated by a signi\ufb01 cant fall in the diffusion index of price changes in CPI during the \ufb01 rst half of 2016-17, which suggests that in\ufb02 ationary impulses were con\ufb01 ned to a few food items (Chart II.5). In in\ufb02 ation developments are likely to be in\ufb02 uenced by three domestic drivers which, in themselves, embed upside risks to the in\ufb02 ation target, namely (a) spatial distribution of food in\ufb02 ation pressures; (b) the implementation of the 7th CPC award, especially house rent allowances and subsequently, implementation by states; and (c) the 42 per cent increase in minimum wages across the board for the central sphere2. Accordingly, the narrative in the rest 2 Activities that come under the purview of Chief Labour Commissioner (central). of this chapter, albeit backward-looking, will be tilted towards a sharper focus on these elements under their respective categories in the CPI. This assumes relevance in view of the presence of considerable slack in the economy, resulting in demand-push factors remaining muted as evident in the relatively stable contribution of services to overall in\ufb02 ation. By contrast, there has been a predominance of supply side factors \u2013 non-durable items that are largely food related \u2013 in the unravelling of recent in\ufb02 ation developments (Chart II.6a). A historical decomposition of in\ufb02 ation shocks also shows that in the April-July episode, it was the positive contribution of domestic supply shocks along with that of \ufb01 rmer international crude oil prices that resulted in the uptick in in\ufb02 ation. Aggregate demand \u2013 embodied in the still negative output gap \u2013 along with continuing pass-through of past monetary policy tightening worked towards tempering in\ufb02 ation pressures (Chart II.6b). In the food and beverages sub-group \u2013 the dominant category in the CPI with a weight of 46 per cent \u2013 in\ufb02 ation rose steadily through April-July. The sharp, though delayed, correction in August was triggered by the compression in the contribution of vegetables. The food group contributed 59 per cent to average headline CPI in\ufb02 ation during April-August, with price pressures mainly emanating from pulses, sugar and vegetables (Chart II.7). 5 1 - g u A    6 1 - r p A  The heat map visually elaborates the evolution of in\ufb02 ation. Greener areas indicate low in\ufb02 ation pressures and increasing order of red represents higher and higher in\ufb02 ation. Source: CSO and staff estimates. 6 1 - g u A Pulses have been the major source of food in\ufb02 ation consistently since Q2 of 2015-16 (Chart II.8). Reeling under two consecutive droughts, the production of pulses declined from 19.3 million tonnes in 2013-14 to 16.5 million tonnes in 2015-16 and the widening of the demand-supply imbalances elevated pulse prices unconscionably. As a consequence, pulses accounted for 22 per cent of food in\ufb02 ation and 13 per cent of overall in\ufb02 ation during April-August, despite a relatively low weight of 2.4 per cent in CPI. Excluding pulses, average food in\ufb02 ation would have been lower by 1.2 percentage points and average headline in\ufb02 ation by 0.6 percentage points during this period. In order to augment the supply of pulses, the Government undertook a number of measures, including higher imports at zero import duty, raising the buffer stock of pulses as well as minimum support prices (MSP). Although initially hamstrung by delayed arrival of imports, procurement at a time of high market prices and low offtake by States; the combined effects of these measures are increasingly visible in softening price pressures in pulses. Sugar emerged as the second major driver of food in\ufb02 ation during \ufb01 rst half of 2016-17 (Chart II.8). Despite adequate availability of stocks and reasonably good production, in\ufb02 ation in this component rose sharply and remained in double digits from April, suggesting possible illicit stocking. Some moderation in sugar prices is expected by October 2016 as the cane- crushing season begins and fresh output is released in the market, although policy interventions may be warranted to ensure this outcome. A number of price control measures have been undertaken by the Government, including imposition of stock holding limits, extension of production subsidy, withdrawal of the mandatory export quota as well as extending \ufb01 nancial assistance to the sugar mills through soft loan scheme. Food in\ufb02 ation was also pushed up by a sharp uptick in prices of vegetables, especially tomatoes. Upside impulses started to manifest in April in a typical pre- monsoon sequence; however, pressures accentuated during June-July 2016 on account of the delayed onset of the south west monsoon. Food supply management strategies need to be informed by the spatial dynamics of in\ufb02 ation. Empirical scrutiny of the stronger than anticipated \ufb01 rming of food price pressures during April to July 2016 in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) framework that tests inter alia for the equality of mean in\ufb02 ation across states reveals signi\ufb01 cant spatial variations. Inter-state price differences turn out to be statistically signi\ufb01 cant for all sub-groups of food. Cereal prices show up pockets of high in\ufb02 ation in Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha. Vegetables in\ufb02 ation was highest in the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal, and least in the hilly states of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. Pulses in\ufb02 ation, which averaged 30 per cent across the country, was relatively low at around 13 per cent in Assam and West Bengal (Annex Table II.1). These wide variations across states appear to be complemented by rising inter-state divergence in the case of commodities such as eggs, oils and fats, spices and sugar. This calls for integrating fragmented agricultural markets in the country, if food supply management policies have to be effective. Cluster analysis by sifting centre-level daily data from mandis3 points to strong regional variation in mark-ups from wholesale to retail prices for pulses, especially in the case of tur. In centres like Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and Siliguri, the mark-ups for tur have been strikingly higher than in the rest of the country (Chart II.9). Thus, the sharp increase in retail prices in pulses, for example, is due to a combination of increases in wholesale prices and unduly large retail margins. In the fuel and light sub-group, in\ufb02 ation softened steadily through April-August. Electricity demand underwent a sustained moderation in an environment of subdued offtake from the manufacturing sector as well as from stress-laden distribution companies (DISCOMs). With the resulting compression in the demand supply gap, spot electricity prices fell below the average price in the power purchase agreement (PPA) contracts. LPG prices also declined sharply, largely in\ufb02 uenced by the softening of international gas prices. International kerosene prices have hardened during the \ufb01 nancial year so far, driving a wedge between the administered kerosene price which has been increased by `0.25 per litre per month beginning July 2016; under-recoveries on account of kerosene prices rose to `10.5 per litre effective October 1, 2016 from `6.5 per litre for March 2016. In\ufb02 ation in respect of fuel items has diverged signi\ufb01 cantly between rural and urban areas with the latter, in fact, going into de\ufb02 ation in August. Items of fuel consumption in rural areas like \ufb01 rewood and dung cake reveal stickiness; on the other hand, fuel items in urban consumption are increasingly getting indexed to international prices (Chart II.10). imbibing this halting moderation. Housing, clothing and footwear, and health were the main drivers (with a combined weight of 48 per cent in CPI excluding food and fuel), contributing 54 per cent of in\ufb02 ation in this category (Chart II.11). Included in this sub-group under transportation, however, are petrol and diesel4; if they are excluded, in\ufb02 ation excluding food and fuel (and petrol and diesel) would have moved down by less \u2013 from 5.3 per cent in April to 5.0 per cent in August (Chart II.12a). CPI in\ufb02 ation excluding food and fuel eased unevenly through April-August from 5.0 per cent in April to 4.6 per cent in August, with most of the sub-groups As alluded to in Chapter I, the implementation of the 7th CPC award starting August 2016 is expected to have a signi\ufb01 cant and drawn out impact on the CPI in\ufb02 ation 4 As set out in Chapter 1, pump prices of petrol and diesel are adjusted to movements in international prices with a fortnight\u2019s lag. During April-September, these prices were revised upwards and downwards six times, yielding a cumulative increase of around `4 per litre in petrol and diesel prices over this period. These effects will be magni\ufb01 ed as implementation spreads at the state level, as the experience with the 5th and 6th CPC awards have shown (Box II.1 of the April 2016 MPR provides a comprehensive assessment), playing out over a period of two years. These developments will have to be carefully monitored on account of the risks of getting generalised. Since outliers like vegetables and pulses impart a strong positive skew, trimming the in\ufb02 ation distribution by removing speci\ufb01 c portions of upper and lower tails of the distribution is widely used to understand underlying in\ufb02 ation movements5, with the weighted median being a specific case of trimming. Trimmed means, the weighted median and exclusion-based measures of CPI in\ufb02 ation reveal a central tendency at around 5 per cent during April-August 2016 (Chart II.12b). In\ufb02 ation measured by other sectoral CPIs broadly tracked the movements in headline CPI. The wholesale price index (WPI), which had been in negative territory for 17 successive months, registered in\ufb02 ation of 1.4 per cent in Q1 of 2016-17 that rose to 3.7 per cent in August 2016. As a result, the divergence between CPI and WPI in\ufb02 ation, which was at 7.4 percentage points in 2015-16, narrowed down to 1.3 percentage points 5 Roger, Scott, (1998), \u201cCore In\ufb02 ation: Concepts, Uses and Measurement,\u201d Reserve Bank of New Zealand Discussion Paper No. G98/9 (July), Wellington, in August 2016. This re\ufb02 ected the bottoming out of the prolonged downturn in international commodity prices. Given the stickiness observed in services in\ufb02 ation in the CPI, and the impending HRA effects of the 7th CPC award, it is unlikely that the divergence would reduce further. GDP and GVA de\ufb02 ators, which had been in the negative zone for two consecutive quarters, also started rising since Q4 of 2015-16 (Chart II.13). Domestic farm and non-farm input costs embedded in the WPI have risen sequentially beginning October 2015, although the rates of increase are still benign (Chart II.14). In the farm sector, price rises in respect of high speed diesel, pesticides, tractors, fodder and cattle feed have contributed to the hardening of costs. Interventions such as \u2018Make in India\u2019 and the Government\u2019s initiative to bring down prices of fertilisers by (a) reduction in non-urea prices for the \ufb01 rst time in the last 15 years; and (b) increasing domestic production of fertilisers will have positive effects on the farm sector. In the case of industrial inputs, sequential price increases in respect of mineral oil, metallic minerals and non-food articles \u2013 especially \ufb01 bre and oil seeds \u2013 have started imposing cost pressures. The 75th round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey (IOS) pertaining to July-September 2016 suggests that input price pressures are building up, with the rise in raw materials costs expected to continue into Q3. On the other hand, surveys of purchasing managers in manufacturing and services \u2013 that provide contemporaneous information \u2013 suggest that input and output price pressures still remain weak by histrocial standards. Rural wage growth exhibited divergent movements in its constituents. Rural non-agricultural wage growth has ebbed in recent months, possibly re\ufb02 ecting an increase in supply of non-agricultural labourers in rural areas due to weak construction activity attracting less labour migration to urban areas. In contrast, agricultural labour wage growth rose on the back of demand as sowing conditions improved. At the state level, agricultural wages increased, especially in foodgrain producing states such as Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (Chart II.15). The proposed revision in basic minimum wages of the central sphere for different categories of employees (unskilled, semi-skilled, skilled, highly skilled and clerical)6 would support rural incomes that have been depressed by drought conditions for two successive years (2014-16). At the same time, however, it would push up headline CPI in\ufb02 ation, as analysed in Chapter I. The expected increase in rural wages is also likely to bring on second round effects on in\ufb02 ation. the subdued growth in farm labour wages \u2013 the MSPs of pulses have been raised substantially on top of the sizable hike last year and are set to be raised even higher in the period ahead, with implications for the in\ufb02 ation outlook. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) recommends MSP for agricultural commodities, including cereals and pulses, based inter alia on costs of production, labour and other inputs, with labour cost accounting for more than half of the total cost of production. While increases in MSPs for cereals have been moderate in the recent period \u2013 partly owing to Wages in the organised sector re\ufb02 ected in staff costs per employee remained \ufb01 rm in Q1 of 2016-17 for both the manufacturing and the services sectors. On the other hand, unit labour cost measured by the ratio of staff cost to value of production, continued to rise for \ufb01 rms engaged in both sectors, notwithstanding some moderation in the case of manufacturing companies (Chart II.16). 6 The pay structure of these employees includes basic minimum wages plus a variable dearness allowance (VDA), which is a \ufb01 xed amount of money given per point increase in CPI-IW as noti\ufb01 ed by the Chief Labour Commissioner (central sphere) from time to time. VDA is revised twice a year - on 1st of April and October while basic minimum wage revisions happen at an interval not exceeding \ufb01 ve years. Internationally, 160 countries have some form of value added tax (World Bank, 2015). The experiences of the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Malaysia suggest that in\ufb02 ation did increase in the period when GST was introduced (Table 1). Eventually, the in\ufb02 ation impact moderated over a year, except in the case of United Kingdom where it remained elevated, due mainly to the oil crisis in 1973. Estimates of pass- through of changes in the VAT rate to consumer prices for 17 Euro zone countries for the period 1999-2013 show that, on average, the pass-through is much less than full and is highly sensitive to the type of VAT change. For changes in the standard rate, for instance, the \ufb01 nal pass-through is about 100 per cent; for reduced rates, however, it is signi\ufb01 cantly less at around 30 per cent. The short-term effects on in\ufb02 ation depend upon a host of factors, including the tax rate at which GST is implemented, the tax base and ef\ufb01 ciency of the administrative machinery. Looking ahead, in\ufb02 ation developments are likely to be shaped by the implementation of the GST. While the creation of a uni\ufb01 ed goods and services market in the country would reduce supply chain rigidities, cut down on transportation costs and also bring down costs in general through improvements in productivity, it could also produce a short-lived pass-through to the in\ufb02 ation trajectory. The cross- country experience suggests that, controlling for country-speci\ufb01 c characteristics, one-off effects tend to dissipate after a year of its implementation (Box II.1). The impact of the implementation of GST on CPI in\ufb02 ation in India would largely depend on the standard rate that would be decided by the GST Council. The dual rate GST structure with a standard rate of 18 per cent and a low rate of 12 per cent (consistent with a revenue neutral rate (RNR) of about 15-15.5 per cent) is expected to have a minimal impact on in\ufb02 ation (GoI, 2015)7. If the standard rate is increased to 22 per cent8 (consistent with an RNR of 17-18 per cent), the impact on aggregate in\ufb02 ation would be in the range of 0.3-0.7 per cent, concentrated in select groups like healthcare (excluding medicines). As the standard rate increases from 22 per cent to 26 per cent and 30 per cent, the impact on CPI would increase from 0.6- 1.3 per cent and to 1.0-1.9 per cent (with input tax credit), respectively7. The general consensus is that the impact on consumer price in\ufb02 ation is likely to be moderate if the standard GST rate is at 18 per cent \u2013 in fact, overall price levels may go down due to more ef\ufb01 cient allocation of factors of production (NCAER, 2009)9. 7 Government of India (2015), \u201cReport on the Revenue Neutral Rate and Structure of Rates for the Goods and Services Tax (GST)\u201d, Ministry of Finance, December. 8 In both scenarios, a high tax rate of 35 per cent was applied to about 1 per cent of CPI (that relates to luxury goods). 9 NCAER (2009), \u201cMoving to Goods and Services Tax in India: Impact on India\u2019s Growth and International Trade\u201d, December. 1.8 2.9 2.2 0.8 27.4 2.9 4.5 Aggregate demand slowed down in the first quarter of 2016-17, restrained by weak investment, but consumption spending is gradually improving. Aggregate supply conditions are poised to receive a strong boost from a reinvigoration of agriculture with some support from services, but industrial activity remains subdued. Economic activity lost some pace in the \ufb01 rst half of 2016-17, relative to the preceding six months and a year ago. A deeper moderation has been cushioned by robust public spending. A retrenchment of investment has been underlying the slowdown; although public investment has been stepped up, crowding-in effects on private investment are not yet discernible. Private consumption spending has moderated somewhat, but a revival of agricultural activity and incomes and a sizable upward revision in wages and salaries in the public sector are set to boost it and regenerate growth impulses across the economy in the rest of 2016-17 and in the next year. While the weakness in domestic demand has sent imports into a prolonged contraction, the weakening global economy and \ufb01 nancial market turbulence constitute the biggest risks to net exports and to overall economic activity, going forward. government \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure, real GDP growth would have slumped to 5.7 per cent in Q1 of 2016-17, the lowest since Q4 of 2014-15 (Chart III.1). Demand conditions were undermined by a deepening of the contraction in gross \ufb01 xed capital formation that set in from Q4 of 2015-16, besides a slowdown in private \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure after two consecutive quarters of relatively robust growth. Weak domestic demand was also re\ufb02 ected in a sizable shrinking of imports, which enabled a positive Measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in real gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices, aggregate demand decelerated to a \ufb01 ve-quarter low in Q1 of 2016-17, unable to sustain the strength of the upturn in the immediately preceding quarter (Table III.1).

Investment demand has been muted through the \ufb01 rst half of 2016-17, juxtaposing the absolute decline in gross \ufb01 xed capital formation in Q1 of 2016-17 with more recent higher frequency indicators. Capex spending remains moribund even as industry is operating marginally below the long-term average of capacity utilisation on a seasonally adjusted basis (Chart III.2). Still signi\ufb01 cant \ufb01 nancial stress in large brown \ufb01 eld projects, especially in sectors such as iron and steel, construction, textiles and power continues to inhibit bank credit \ufb02 ows. Depressed construction activity and lacklustre demand for plant and machinery more generally is being mirrored in the coincident decline in production and imports of capital goods (Chart III.3). Re\ufb02 ecting the lacklustre investment climate, new investment intentions have slowed down by 19 per cent on y-o-y basis in Q2 of 2016-17 (Chart III.4). It needs to be noted, however, that the Project Monitoring Group is striving to galvanise new investments; it cleared 65 large projects in 2016-17 (up to September, 2016) worth `3.05 trillion (as compared with 89 projects worth `2.7 trillion in April- September, 2015-16). When these clearances fructify, these will increase the value of investment, with the majority of these projects in the roads, power, coal and petroleum sectors. While the stock of stalled projects declined by 44 per cent in Q1 and 28 per cent in Q2 of 2016-17 on a sequential 20 basis \u2013 propelled by faster clearances, particularly in respect of non-environmental permissions \u2013 on- streaming of investment spending in these projects is yet to materialise, largely due to unfavourable market conditions. Meanwhile, sales of non-government non-\ufb01 nancial companies have contracted, and both foreign direct investment and external commercial borrowings have slowed down in relation to their levels a year ago. Even though private \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure (PFCE) growth decelerated in Q1 in relation to immediately preceding quarters in tandem with the production of consumer goods, it continued to anchor the evolution of aggregate demand in the economy, contributing 52.3 per cent of real GDP growth. For the \ufb01 rst half of the year cumulatively, a modest improvement in consumption spending may be taking root. Overall, consumer goods production slowed in July, but remained in positive territory for the third consecutive month on an improvement in the production of durables \u2013 re\ufb02 ective of the underlying resilience of urban consumption. Sales of passenger vehicles \u2013 another indicator of urban consumption demand \u2013 posted double-digit growth in July-August. Urban spending is poised to pick up with the implementation of the 7th CPC award on wages, salaries and pensions from August as well as from the ongoing preference of banks for relatively less risky retail and personal lending. Manufacturing purchasing managers index continued to point to modest expansion in employment since July 2016. Rural incomes and consumption spending should also receive a strong boost from the satisfactory spread and intensity of the south west monsoon, with the foodgrains production in robust and acceleration in sales of tractors (excluding exports) and two-wheelers in August providing lead indications. While rural wage growth in April-July was slightly slower than a year ago, the implementation of the increase in minimum wages in the central sphere (see Chapter II) should improve rural incomes, going forward. Turning to government \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure (GFCE) which provided strong support to aggregate demand in Q1, information gleaned from central government \ufb01 nances during Q2 so far (July-August, 2016) indicates this was sustained by a growth of 19.3 per cent in Plan revenue expenditure, largely in the form of spending on social and physical infrastructure1. Consequently, plan revenue expenditure in April- August rose as a proportion to budget estimates (BE) and on a year-on-year basis. Non-plan revenue expenditure was somewhat lower than a year ago in relation to BE for the \ufb01 rst \ufb01 ve months of 2016-17, with the expenditure on major subsidies and interest payments going through contractions in July-August 1 Plan expenditure on \u2018information and communication technology\u2019, \u2018chemicals and fertilisers\u2019, \u2018heavy industries\u2019, \u2018textiles\u2019, \u2018urban development\u2019 ,\u2018consumer affairs, food and public distribution\u2019, \u2018housing and urban poverty alleviation\u2019, \u2018social justice and empowerment\u2019 and \u2018human resource development\u2019 are largely revenue expenditure. 1.

Overall capital expenditure, however, increased in July-August, both on the plan and non-plan account, even as capital expenditure fell back marginally in relation to BE in April-August (Table III.2). Gross tax revenue recorded signi\ufb01 cant growth during April-August, led by buoyant income tax and excise duty collections (Chart III.5). The sharp growth in income tax collections in April-August re\ufb02 ected the change in advance tax payment requirements for individuals2, lower refunds by the Government than 2 As per the new rule, individuals are now required to make four instalments of advance tax payments from the current year as compared to three instalments earlier. Within indirect taxes, while union excise duty collections were buoyed by higher consumption of petroleum products, the growth in the service tax receipts was signi\ufb01 cantly higher than a year ago due to the imposition of Krishi Kalyan cess at 0.5 per cent with effect from June 1, 2016. Non-tax revenue was, however, lower than last year as disinvestment failed to pick up despite conducive stock market conditions. In view of these developments, there was deterioration in the gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit (GFD) as a proportion to BE during April-August, mainly on account of a sharp increase in the revenue de\ufb01 cit. The Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) statement indicates that in order to absorb the complete impact of pay revisions in 2016-17, the provision for salary payments made in the Union Budget will require some enhancement in the revised estimates. The \ufb01 rst batch of supplementary demands for grants for 2016-17 announced in August entails a net cash outgo of `209 billion over and above the BE. Therefore, \ufb01 scal spending may have to be restrained going forward in order to adhere to the target. The secondary impact of additional pay-out due to the Pay Commission recommendations on aggregate demand is likely to be muted as the revenue expenditure multiplier is found to be less than one in the Indian context4, partly re\ufb02 ecting the dampening impact of leakages through direct and indirect taxes. Moreover, as disbursements under the Pay Commission are undertaken without compromising the ongoing \ufb01 scal consolidation process, the growth enhancing impact will be moderate unlike the 5th and 6th Pay Commission awards. Taking into account the surge in Q1, net exports contributed to the increase in aggregate demand in the \ufb01 rst quarter of 2016-17 through a large saving on account of cutbacks in major merchandise imports such as petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL), gold, iron 3 The surcharge on high net worth individuals having income above `1 crore has been increased from 12 per cent to 15 per cent from the current \ufb01 nancial year in line with the announcement made in the Union Budget 2016-17. 4 Jain, Rajeev and Kumar, Prabhat (2013), \u201cSize of Government Expenditure Multipliers in India: A Structural VAR analysis\u201d, RBI Working Paper Series 7.

This was also re\ufb02 ected in the current account de\ufb01 cit narrowing to near-balance (0.1 per cent of GDP in Q1 from 1.2 per cent a year ago). Merchandise exports declined by 3 per cent in April- August in an environment of subdued global trade and output, and net terms of trade gains were eroded by the \ufb01 rming up of commodity prices. Emerging market economies (EMEs), which account for more than half of India\u2019s export receipts, have suffered a persistent decline in their import volume (Chart III.6). Gold import volume declined in April-August to almost a third of its level a year ago due to destocking of gold purchased earlier, subdued rural demand due to two consecutive poor monsoons and possibility of some supply through informal channels. The fall in non- oil non-gold imports in the year so far, particularly in the capital goods segment, re\ufb02 ects the weak domestic investment climate. Consequently, the merchandise trade de\ufb01 cit shrank sharply to US$ 34.7 billion in the \ufb01 rst \ufb01 ve months of 2016-17 from US$ 58.4 billion a year ago. Net services exports declined by over 10 per cent (April-July) as all major segments, except software services, were in contractionary mode. The prospects of private transfers, which had declined by about US$ 2 billion (a y-o-y decline of 11 per cent) in Q1, are uncertain as the prolonged softness in crude prices takes its toll on remittances from the Middle East. Disconcerting evidence has been forming for some time now that the engine of trade liberalisation that powered global output and trade since the 1980s in a rapidly integrating world marketplace is stalling. The ratio of world trade to GDP has been languishing since 2012, the longest phase of stagnation in the post-World War II period. The volume of world trade has plateaued since the beginning of 2015, even as underlying \ufb01 nancial \ufb02 ows are coming off their pre- global crisis peaks. More recent evidence is pointing to a sharp drop in the demand for EME exports from AEs, particularly from the US, notwithstanding the recovery in US demand and the strength of the US dollar. While the biggest contraction of US demand is in respect of imports from China, imports from India have also fallen in value terms during 2016 so far. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), US imports from EMEs excluding China have been in contraction since 2015. This is being regarded as con\ufb01 rmation of the weakening of US manufacturing spreading to EMEs through the channel of trade5. Imports from EMEs by the European Union have also been contracting since 2015. Trade as a driver of world growth is on the wane, and instead a steady rise in protectionism is turning the tide of globalisation, possibly reversing it. India\u2019s trade sector has also faced considerable protectionism in major partner economies. According to the Global Trade Alert database, Indian exports have been mainly impacted directly or indirectly through various types of measures, both tariff and non-tariff, in partner countries. Output measured by gross value added (GVA) at basic prices moderated marginally in Q1 of 2016-17 on a sequential y-o-y basis, although it was still a little above the average quarterly GVA growth recorded in 2015-16 (Table III.3). Seasonally adjusted q-o-q annualised growth indicates, however, a strengthening of momentum in Q1 relative to the immediately preceding quarter (Chart III.7a)6. The April 2016 MPR had projected a gradual improvement in GVA growth from 7.3 per cent in Q1 to 7.7 per cent in Q2. With most of the initial assumptions underlying these projections materialising, the actual outcome for Q1 has matched the projection (Chart III.7b) (see Chapter I).Turning to Q2, the deceleration in value added in agriculture and allied activities in Q1 is well-positioned to reverse, although the upturn could undershoot the April 2016 projection slightly. The south-west monsoon commenced with a delay but soon gathered momentum and by mid-July, it had covered 89 per cent of the country\u2019s meteorological sub-divisional area with excess/normal rainfall. From the second week of August, it waned in intensity and by end-September, precipitation was 3 per cent below the long period average (LPA) and was excess /normal across 85 per cent of the country\u2019s meteorological sub-divisional area7.

It picked up vigorously thereafter and by the end of September, it was 3.5 per cent higher than last year\u2019s sown area, most notably under pulses (29.2 per cent), but also with respect to rice, coarse cereals and oilseeds. This has brightened the prospects of kharif crops production. According to the \ufb01 rst advance estimates, the production of kharif foodgrains during 2016-17 at 135.0 million tonnes was 8.9 per cent higher than last year. The production of kharif pulses was a record high at 8.7 million tonnes. Among commercial crops, the production of oilseeds and cotton increased by 41.0 per cent and 6.6 per cent, respectively, over last year, even as that of sugarcane contracted. The satisfactory performance of the south west monsoon augurs well for the prospects of the rabi crops. The signi\ufb01 cant improvement in reservoir levels, especially in the Central and Western region, which accounts for around 64 per cent of irrigated area from these reservoirs, and the improvement in soil moisture conditions should enable the achievement of the rabi foodgrains target of 137.4 million tonnes (higher than that of 128.2 million tonnes last year). Growth of value added in the industrial sector in Q1 was pulled down by a contraction in mining and quarrying caused inter alia by a deceleration in the production of coal and absolute declines in the output of crude petroleum and natural gas. Turning to Q2, industrial production contracted in July, though a caveat is in order. Since the second half of 2015-16, movements in the index of industrial production (IIP) have been unduly in\ufb02 uenced by a sharp contraction in the lumpy and large order-driven output of insulated rubber cables (IRC). It has produced strong and overwhelming effects on the headline index as well as on capital goods of which it is a component. Trimmed of IRC, industrial production would have risen by 3.2 per cent during April-July 2016 instead of contracting by 0.2 per cent. This is corroborated by the movements in a truncated IIP8 (Chart III.8). Manufacturing output contracted in July, although excluding IRC, it would have posted an expansion of 2.1 per cent. Nonetheless, manufacturing performance continues to face headwinds from the subdued business and 8 Truncated IIP: 96 per cent of IIP excluding top 2 per cent and bottom 2 per cent of volatile items. investment environment. Illustratively, while sales companies of non-government manufacturing contracted in Q1 of 2016-17, pro\ufb01 tability was shored up by other income and still soft input costs rather than a durable strengthening of output, with some indications of improvement in Q2. The corporate sector is challenged by high levels of leverage, relative to debt servicing capacity and concentration of risks. In this context, the vulnerability of the corporate sector to external debt has been ampli\ufb01 ed by low debt servicing capacity. As regards other components of the IIP, electricity generation dipped in July after growing at a healthy pace in preceding months. It has fallen further in August due to contraction in thermal power generation \u2013 the \ufb01 rst time in 16 months \u2013 with the plant load factor falling to a low of 52 per cent. Electricity demand has also been experiencing a sustained moderation in an environment of subdued offtake from the manufacturing sector as well as from stress-laden distribution companies (DISCOMs). The demand-supply gap narrowed to 0.5 per cent of total demand from 2.5 per cent a year ago. Consequently, suppliers sold electricity in the spot exchange \u2013 volumes reached a record high of 3,580 million units in July before dipping to 3,445 million units in August \u2013 bringing down exchange-traded spot prices to `2.20 per kilowatt hour (kWh), lower than prices under long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). In terms of use-based activity, consumer non- durables slipped back into negative territory in July \u2013 a nine-month long slump had been interrupted by tentative positive growth in June \u2013 indicating that rural consumption is still weak. On the other hand, consumer durables have been supported by the abiding strength of urban consumption. While, basic goods decelerated, capital goods excluding IRC rose by barely 0.5 per cent in July, re\ufb02 ecting subdued investment demand. The recent momentum in core industries was sustained by a sharp pick-up in steel production in August 2016 re\ufb02 ecting inter alia low base and imposition of minimum import price, anti- dumping and safeguard duties. This, in consonance with the positive trend in cement production, augurs well for construction sector \u2013 even though the output of core industries as a whole was constrained by a decline in the production of coal, crude oil and natural gas, and deceleration in re\ufb01 nery products and electricity generation. The environment for industrial activity should improve with recent policy initiatives like liberalisation of foreign direct investment (FDI) policy in defence, civil aviation, pharmaceutical and broadcasting. This is being re\ufb02 ected in the manufacturing purchasing managers the index which has remained expansionary zone since January 2016 mainly driven by new and export orders. Value added in the services sector, which constitutes around 63 per cent of total GVA, accelerated in Q1 on the back of stronger growth in public administration, defence and other services, supported by \ufb01 nancial, real estate and professional services. On the other hand, activity in the construction sector slowed down and GVA growth in trade, hotels, transport and communication slowed sequentially. In Q2, public administration and defence services would have been boosted by the implementation of the 7th CPC award and one rank one pension (OROP) from August. The robust improvement in sales of two wheelers, passenger cars and tractors in recent months suggests that GVA in the transportation sub-sector is picking up (Table III.4). 6 1 - g u A CMV: Commercial Motor Vehicles. Note: y-o-y growth rates are mapped with green cells indicating high and red cells indicating low growth rates. Source: Staff estimates based on data compiled from various sources. Construction activity remained subdued on account of stalled projects in the sector and onset of monsoon. As monsoon winds up, the construction sector is set for a turnaround on the package of measures approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) to revive stalled projects, and especially the unclogging of cash \ufb02 ows. Available information shows that the construction of highways and capital expenditure under Railways are picking up and there are similar signs in respect of the sales of commercial properties in main cities. Though backed by low base, the consumption of steel accelerated in August after two months of contraction. Port cargo continues to decelerate, mostly on account of slowdown in imports of coal as domestic production picked up, and also due to contraction in tonnage of iron ore and fertilisers. Railway freight contracted due to low haulage of coal, and foodgrains, but it is expected to turn around once kharif procurement of foodgrains starts. Growth of foreign tourist arrivals accelerated on account of the e-visa facility. Accordingly, the services PMI improved further, driven by new business and improved business expectations in Q2. The above assessments of the formation of aggregate demand and aggregate supply provide insights into the state of the economy vis-a-vis the underlying business cycle and, in turn, the trade-off between growth and in\ufb02 ation confronting the setting of monetary policy. In this context, measurement of the potential level of output i.e., the sustainable level of output in which the intensity of resource use is non-in\ufb02 ationary, becomes crucial. Bearing in mind that potential output is unobservable, that it has to be estimated and that these estimations are highly sensitive to the choice of period and methodology and the availability of data, staff has been employing the pragmatic approach. It combines a battery of methodologies, including different univariate \ufb01 lters - Hodrick\u2013Prescott (HP); Baxter-King (BK); Christiano- Fitzgerald(CF); multivariate Kalman \ufb01 lter \u2013 with estimates of the production function approach in a principal components framework to derive a proximate view of potential output, while cautioning about the limitations with which these estimates have to be used (see MPRs of September 2015 and April 2016). The non-availability of a historical pro\ufb01 le of GVA/GDP under the new series is also a major handicap to the accuracy of these estimates. Given these caveats, updated estimates of potential output suggest that the output gap \u2013 the deviation of actual output from its potential level and expressed as a percentage of potential output \u2013 remains negative, as it has been since 2015-16, but is slowly closing (Chart III.9). This is corroborated by the latest round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey which shows capacity utilisation plateauing, after declining from 2011-12 (Chart III.2). Economic activity is evolving in close alignment with staff\u2019s projections, still below its underlying potential. Persisting slack in the economy has restrained a fuller expression of aggregate demand, which remains essentially consumption-driven. The continuing weakness in investment poses a risk not only to the prospects of the recovery gaining momentum on a durable basis but also to potential output itself. There is also some evidence, anecdotal and estimation-based, that productivity is getting impaired. Key to breaking out of this low-level trap is a revival of investment, especially private, in a conducive environment of reforms in product and factor supplies that unlock productivity and competitiveness, and raise the economy\u2019s potential itself. This acquires urgency in view of the prolonged weakening of the global economy and the sense that global potential output may have become lastingly debilitated. Liquidity conditions have eased significantly, consistent with the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Bond yields touched multi-year lows. Commercial paper (CP) and corporate bond markets witnessed stronger transmission of monetary policy relative to the credit market, with issuances of CPs and corporate bonds increasing. Bank credit growth remains sluggish, albeit consistent with the nominal GDP growth outturn. Spells of turbulence have kept global \ufb01 nancial markets unsettled since the April MPR, mainly sparked by worries about weakening global growth and diminishing con\ufb01 dence in the ability of central banks to nurture a sustainable recovery. In Q1 of 2016-17, equity, bond and commodity markets traded on a subdued note, with higher volatility and investor differentiation having widened credit spreads on EME and corporate assets. The universe of negative yields expanded rapidly in this risk-averse environment. The Brexit vote of June 23, however, took markets by surprise, causing equity, currencies and bonds to plunge across the globe. Yet, recovery too was surprisingly quick, especially in the context of a black swan type event. In Q2, volatility has subsided, commodity prices have \ufb01 rmed up, credit spreads have narrowed, equity markets have rallied to new highs and portfolio \ufb02 ows to EMEs have resumed. Although uncertainty around the Fed\u2019s decision of September 21 did push up bond yields, other market segments maintained poise and risk appetite has intensi\ufb01 ed. imbibed these rigidities, they have declined more than lending rates in recent months. Q1 fully commenced with money markets transmitting the 25 bps cut in the repo rate of April 5. Liquidity conditions were in\ufb02 uenced by restraint in government expenditure and a sustained elevation in currency demand entailing a leakage from the banking system during rabi procurement period of April and May. Open market purchases and term repos of varying tenors, in addition to the Reserve Bank\u2019s normal liquidity operations, assuaged liquidity pressures. Consequently, the weighted average call money rate (WACR) and collateralised overnight rates traded tightly around the repo rate with a slight softening bias (Chart IV.1). The return of currency to the system towards the end of May and a pick-up in government expenditure in June helped to ease liquidity conditions. Domestic \ufb01 nancial markets have been resilient to these global developments and have, in fact, shown greater sensitivity to domestic cues. Even in the equity and foreign exchange segments, which are most vulnerable to global spillovers, the impact of international events has been transient. The Indian rupee turned out to be among the most stable currencies, notwithstanding fears about FCNR(B) redemptions commencing in September. In the money markets, interest rates have eased in the \ufb01 rst half of 2016-17 propelled by comfortable liquidity conditions, and volatility has fallen. Bond yields touched multi-year lows, responding to abundant liquidity and expectations of falling in\ufb02 ation cheered by a satisfactory monsoon. By contrast, credit markets have remained isolated in this generalised softening, with lending rate movements reportedly inhibited by asset quality concerns and balance sheet repair. Although deposit rates have also Two developments are noteworthy in the evolution of money market in this period. First, with the relaxation in reserve maintenance norms (to a daily minimum of 90 per cent from 95 per cent earlier) as part of the re\ufb01 nements in the liquidity management framework in April (see section IV.2), there was a moderation in banks\u2019 holdings of excess reserves (Chart IV.2). Secondly, the market response to the narrowing of the policy rate corridor to +/-50 bps on April 5 was re\ufb02 ected in a compression of money market spreads vis-\u00e0-vis the repo rate and a decline in volatility (Chart IV.3). With the evolution of liquidity condi tions passing a tipping point in June, a new phase was evident in Q2, aided by the return of currency to the banking system, stepped up government expenditure \u2013 necessitating ways and means advances (WMA) from the Reserve Bank \u2013 and stronger mobilisation of deposits. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank switched into a liquidity absorption mode with variable rate reverse repo operations, including of 28-day tenor for the \ufb01 rst time. Surplus transfer from the Reserve Bank was quickly followed by large coupon payments and redemptions in mid-August. The WACR remained below the repo rate throughout, tracked by other overnight money market rates. In fact, on 95 per cent of the trading days in the \ufb01 rst half of 2016-17 (excluding Saturdays), the WACR traded marginally below the repo rate (by about 11 bps on an average). The benign effects of comfortable liquidity conditions in the overnight segments spread through the continuum of money market rates, easing term premia and softening three-month CP and certi\ufb01 cate of deposit (CD) rates to intra-year lows. In fact, CP rates fell well below the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans of up to one- year maturity, rendering CP issuances an attractive alternative for raising working capital funds in an environment characterised by risk aversion among banks (Chart IV.4). Higher rated corporates raised `1.37 trillion in the \ufb01 rst half of the year (up to mid- September 2016) through CPs. The implementation of the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) has impacted liquidity in money markets across the world. In order to cushion these pressures, the Reserve Bank has been providing banks headroom by allowing carve-outs in the prescription of SLR cumulating to 11 per cent of NDTL, including 2 per cent available under the marginal standing facility (MSF). In this sense, the SLR has enabled a friction- free transition to the LCR relative to the cross-country experience (Box IV.1). Bond markets began Q1 on a \ufb01 rm note as investors engaged in consolidation and pro\ufb01 t-booking, although by early May, a softening bias set in as fears of a hike in the US federal funds rate receded and the Reserve Bank\u2019s open market operations lifted sentiment. As in\ufb02 ation moved up higher than expected, however, gilt yields hardened and rising international crude prices added an upside. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold net debt amounting to `106 billion during May and June. Bond markets were least impacted by Brexit, with 10-year FIMMDA generic yields moving up The phased introduction of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) since January 2015 across jurisdictions has altered volume and rates in the unsecured segment of the money market, posing challenges for the implementation of monetary policy (Bonner and Eijf\ufb01 nger, 2012; and Schmitz, 2013). Under the LCR regulation, a bank\u2019s stock of high quality liquid assets (HQLA) must exceed its projected total net cash out\ufb02 ows over the next 30 calendar days under a stress scenario. Any borrowing from the uncollateralised market of less than 30 days maturity attracts a run off rate of 100 per cent, i.e., to be repaid within 30 days, and therefore, would require 100 per cent HQLA backing. A bank can borrow and retain cash as part of HQLA to avoid a fall in LCR, but in that case borrowed liquidity cannot be used for non-HQLA asset \ufb01 nancing. This is observed to have altered banks\u2019 activity in the call money market in the post-LCR regime. Generalised method of moments (GMM) estimates in a dynamic panel data regression framework involving monthly data on bank-wise LCR positions relative to the prescribed norm, capital to risk weighted asset ratios (CRAR), gross non-performing assets (GNPA) as a ratio of total assets and a dummy* to capture the impact of the LCR on the money market show that banks operating closer to the prescribed LCR norm tend to borrow at a higher rate in the call market (Table 1). Banks with higher CRAR seem to have the advantage of borrowing at a lower rate, while banks with higher GNPA have to pay higher rates on their call borrowings. While the WACR (and call volumes) are sensitive to the LCR regulation, the overall impact on the WACR is limited to 7 bps. Thus, the accommodation provided to banks within the prescribed SLR has been critical in mitigating adverse effects of the LCR on the WACR. 0.090 -0.200 0.070 -0.004 0.060 The dummy assigns a value of one to banks with LCR positions within 10 per cent above the prescribed norm and zero otherwise; given that the prescribed LCR in India was raised to 70 per cent in January 2016, banks operating at less than 80 per cent LCR could be expected to borrow in the call market at a higher rate relative to others. References: by eight basis points only on June 23, and softening immediately thereafter. With in\ufb02 ation in India rising beyond the usual seasonal upturn at this time of the year, yields remained range-bound in June, although open market purchase operations continued to provide comfort. Starting in mid-June, gilt yields softened into Q2 with abundant liquidity and optimism generated by the satisfactory progress of the monsoon lifting sentiment, notwithstanding the peaking of in\ufb02 ation in July which the market had fully priced in. The post-Brexit resumption of portfolio \ufb02 ows into the gilt segment of the bond markets also softened yields. Trading volumes in the secondary market increased from a daily average of `489 billion in June to `1057 billion in July and `935 billion in August. A substantial part of the increase in activity was on account of global funds, pushed out of advanced economies by negative yields, and also pro\ufb01 t booking by banks. The new 10-year benchmark announced on August 29, 2016 had a dramatic effect. In the \u2018when issued\u2019 market, it closed at 6.98 per cent on September 2, when trading ceased in that segment, setting the stage for the OTC market. The 10-year benchmark yield touched a multi-year low of 6.80 per cent in the secondary market on September 23. In H1 of 2016-17, gilt yields have eased by more than 50 bps as against a policy repo rate cut of 25 bps (Chart IV.5). Market sentiment was also buoyed by the announcement of a number of measures by the Reserve Bank and SEBI to improve depth and liquidity in the market1. In the corporate bond segment, issuances fell by 4.1 per cent in Q1 indicating subdued corporate investment with a preference for re\ufb01 nancing rather than investing in new capacities. Corporate bond yields \u2013 especially on AAA corporate bonds \u2013 declined signi\ufb01 cantly in Q2, tracking gilts. This galvanised a spate of issuances to take advantage of the rate differential vis-\u00e0-vis bank lending rates. Overall resources mobilised through private placement increased by around 12 per cent in H1 (up to August) over the corresponding period of last year. While FPI investment in corporate bonds witnessed net out\ufb02 ows till August 2016 mainly due to narrowing of interest rate differentials and stable hedging costs, investment by mutual funds (excluding PSU bonds) increased by around 31 per cent over March 2016. Corporates also raised resources through issuances of masala bonds. These bonds are denominated in rupees and entail no exchange rate risk for the issuers. In the \ufb01 nancial year so far, companies have raised around `88 billion through masala bonds. With these alternative avenues, corporates have cut down substantially on their recourse to external commercial borrowings. Equity markets experienced choppy trading in Q1. The Brexit referendum triggered some panic FPI selling, but in the last week of the month, the Sensex recovered these losses and posted increases on the back of optimism over the progress of the monsoon and the Cabinet\u2019s approval of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations. Equity markets turned up in Q2, supported by rejuvenation of FPI buying interest and recovery in global equity markets over expectations of expanded accommodation in monetary policies of systemic central banks. The prospects of the GST coming into force also lifted market sentiment. Overall, the benchmark BSE Sensex posted a gain of around 21 per cent over its February 2016 level in the \ufb01 rst half of 2016- 17. Mid-cap and small-cap stocks outperformed the benchmark indices, pointing to a greater signi\ufb01 cance of domestic macroeconomic conditions relative to the global economy for these \ufb01 rms. These developments have focused interest in market valuations. The price- 1 They include: allowing FPIs to trade on the negotiated dealing system- order matching (NDS-OM) platform; permitting individual investors with demat accounts with depositories to trade directly on NDS-OM; and enabling a market making scheme by Primary Dealers in designated semi-liquid securities. Amended SEBI regulations allowed FPIs to directly access the corporate bond market without brokers in September. to-earnings (PE) ratio of the Sensex was at 20.7 at end- September as against a range between 7.3 (Russia) and 25.7 (South Africa) for other EMEs. Through the \ufb01 rst half of 2016-17, resource mobilisation through IPOs and right issues has been high \u2013 32 companies raised `162.9 billion in H1 as against `126.6 billion during the same period a year ago. What is interesting is that this recent buoyancy in IPOs also evinced strong retail interest \u2013 the average number of times the retail portion of the IPO subscription rose from about 2.4 in 2015-16 to 7.7 in 2016-17 so far. The gains made on listing mirrored this surge in retail participation \u2013 the average listing premium rose from 5.1 per cent in 2015-16 to 22.5 per cent in 2016-17. In the foreign exchange market, the rupee traded with a depreciating bias against the US dollar in Q1, mainly re\ufb02 ecting the strengthening of the US dollar against EME and commodity currencies and the yen on the back of weak macroeconomic data out of China and renewed political turmoil in Brazil. Higher than expected in\ufb02 ation readings and import payment- related foreign currency buying by oil marketing companies and PSUs also impacted the rupee\u2019s movements. FPI out\ufb02 ows, particularly from the debt segment, kept the rupee under downward pressure, which intensi\ufb01 ed with the Brexit vote; however, the rupee recovered ground swiftly, as sentiment improved and FPI \ufb02 ows returned vigorously. Viewed in relation to EME peers, rupee moved in a narrow band, even as several other currencies appreciated in nominal terms, some of them going through corrections of sizable past depreciation. The bounce back from Brexit sustained an appreciating bias in the rupee\u2019s movements into Q2, with intermittent downsides from the strength of the US dollar. Nonetheless, an overall optimism in the rupee was evident in the strong resumption of FPI in\ufb02 ows in both the equity and debt markets. While the rupee traded range-bound in the rest of Q2, uncertainty re\ufb02 ected in one-month implied volatility increased. The rupee moved in a narrow range against the US dollar and the euro in H1. It appreciated strongly against the pound sterling, but depreciated against the Japanese yen, mirroring cross-currency movements against the US dollar (Chart IV.6). In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate index (36-currency basket), the rupee exhibited stability through H1, whereas in terms of the real effective exchange rate index, it appreciated by 3.6 per cent since March 2016 (Table IV.1). In the credit market, activity weakened as non-food credit growth remained sluggish through H1 (Chart IV.7). Movements in credit \ufb02 ows, however, need to be juxtaposed against two developments which suggest that underlying credit market activity may not have been as feeble as the headline numbers suggest. First, banks have written-off/sold loans to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), which effectively compressed their loan books. Second and more importantly, more than half of the Ujawal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) bond issuances during the \ufb01 nancial year so far represent conversion/swapping of bank credit into special securities. Adjusting for the UDAY bond issuances, the \ufb02 ow of non-food credit to the economy during H1 (up to September 16, 2016) was comparable to that in the corresponding period of Appreciation (+) / Depreciation (-) (per cent) 2.3 -4.1 -3.1 -6.6 -6.8 last year (Chart IV.8). In terms of industry sub-sectors, bank credit to chemicals, textiles, food processing and mining further contracted. Non-banking sources of funding for the commercial sector, both foreign and domestic, also remained subdued. As a result, the total \ufb02 ow of resources to the commercial sector during the year (up to September 16, 2016) was lower by about 15 per cent than a year ago. The Reserve Bank instituted a new lending rate system for banks \u2013 the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) system \u2013 effective April 1, 2016 (Box IV.2). During H1 of 2016-17, the median one-year MCLR of PSBs and private sector banks declined by 15 bps and 25 bps, respectively (Chart IV.9). Banks have, however, increased the spread and term premia over the same period, effectively leaving the WALR on outstanding rupee loans unchanged. For fresh rupee loans, the WALR declined by 5 bps (April-August). Rupee loans that are being disbursed since April 1, 2016 are priced at the MCLR, and therefore, the base rate continues to account for a substantial share in the pricing of outstanding credit. A comparison of the behaviour of key components of the MCLR reveals that the marginal cost of funds has moderated in respect of both PSBs and private sector banks, driven down by the marginal cost of borrowings (Chart IV.10). On the \ufb02 ip side, the expected return on net worth has increased from an already elevated level. The benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) system introduced in 2003 fell short of its original intent of serving as the reference rate for pricing loan products linked to the actual cost of funds. Perversely, the share of sub-BPLR lending rose as high as 77 per cent by September 2008, concentrated at longer term tenors (above three years), effectively undermining the BPLR. Residential housing and consumer durables were outside the purview of the BPLR and sub-BPLR lending became a source of distortion in terms of cross- subsidization across borrower categories. The base rate system, which came into effect in July 2010, was meant to guard against the arbitrary pricing of loans prevalent under the BPLR system by disallowing loans at sub-prime rates. However, discrimination in the pricing of credit between new and old customers continued as banks often tweaked the spread over the base rate. The \ufb02 exibility accorded to banks in the determination of cost of funds \u2013 average, marginal or blended cost \u2013 rendered assessment of transmission dif\ufb01 cult. The MCLR system introduced on April 1, 2016 was designed taking into account limitations of both the BPLR and the base rate regimes. Under the MCLR system, banks determine their benchmark lending rates linked to marginal cost of funds. The MCLR consists of four components: (a) marginal cost of funds (i.e., marginal cost of borrowings comprising deposits and other borrowings, and return on net worth), (b) negative carry on account of cash reserve ratio (CRR), (c) operating costs and (d) term premium/discount for prescribed maturities. The MCLR plus spread is the actual lending rate for a borrower. The spread comprises two components, viz., business strategy and credit risk premium. In principle, the role of each component of the MCLR can be monitored and analysed. Different components of the MCLR vary widely across banks at any point in time, re\ufb02 ecting: (i) differences in the composition and maturity pro\ufb01 le of their liabilities \u2013 current, savings and time deposits - and the extent of reliance on retail vis-a-vis wholesale customers, which has a bearing on the cost of funds; (ii) divergences in the operating cost environment of banks arising from differences in the use of technology, quality of human capital and the geographical spread of bank branches; and (iii) the return on net worth expected by banks. An inter-temporal comparison of monetary policy transmission shows that the magnitude of transmission varies across regimes and policy cycles. The transmission of monetary policy is marked by long and variable time lags with asymmetric market responses to policy impulses \u2013 generally higher during a tightening phase and lower during an easing phase, irrespective of the prevailing regime for pricing of credit (Table 1). In the current environment, factors that continue to impede transmission include: (i) \ufb01 xed interest rates offered on savings deposits (though deregulated) which, along with current accounts, constitute around 35 per cent of aggregate deposits, thereby sti\ufb02 ing transmission to more than a third of deposits; (ii) no reduction in interest rates on small savings in Q2 of 2016-17, followed by a marginal reduction of 10 bps in Q3, notwithstanding a notable decline in G-sec yields; (iii) stressed asset quality of banks and pricing of risk premium re\ufb02 ecting risk aversion; and (iv) sluggish demand for bank credit. 400 150 425 125 125 -25 275 125 125 25 200 25 50 55 -5 15 37 8 -125 8 50 0 25 30 62 -13 28 Under the amended RBI Act, 1934 and related noti\ufb01 cations, the Reserve Bank is enjoined to set out the operating procedure of monetary policy and any changes thereto in the public domain. This operating procedure \u2013 embodied in the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity management framework \u2013 was published in the April 2015 MPR, Box IV.I. The central premise of the operating procedure is to achieve the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 to align the weighted average call money rate (WACR) with the repo rate through active liquidity management, consistent with the stance of monetary policy. Based on continuous assessment of the performance of the operating framework in pursuit of this objective and the evolving nature of liquidity demand in the economy, major changes were introduced in the framework in April 2016, which included: (a) narrowing the liquidiy adjustment facility (LAF) corridor around the policy repo rate from +/- 100 bps to +/-50 bps; (b) smoothening the supply of liquidity through timely use of open market purchase/ sale auctions in conjunction with normal liquidity facilities and \ufb01 ne-tuning operations; (c) progressively lowering the ex ante liquidity de\ufb01 cit in the system to a position closer to neutrality; and (d) reducing the minimum daily maintenance of the CRR from 95 per cent of the requirement to 90 per cent. Since the introduction of these re\ufb01 nements in the liquidity management framework, the Reserve Bank has injected liquidity of `1.01 trillion through open market operations (OMOs) in the \ufb01 rst half of the year. Including the liquidity impact of foreign exchange market operations, the net injection of permanent liquidity was of the order of about `1.6 trillion (Chart IV.11), which has signi\ufb01 cantly offset the in\ufb02 uence of the two key autonomous drivers of liquidity \u2013 cash balances of the Government and currency demand (Chart IV.12). In Q1, currency demand increased by `600 billion in the \ufb01 rst three weeks of April. Accordingly, `300 billion was injected through open market purchases in April and `400 billion in May to accommodate the higher liquidity de\ufb01 cit in the system, given the access to the LAF averaging around `1 trillion. Gyrations in liquidity conditions were in\ufb02 uenced by \ufb02 uctuations in Government cash balances and other frictional factors which were evened out through \ufb01 ne-tuning operations involving variable rate repo auctions of tenors ranging between 5 days and 21 days. In Q2, with the Government taking recourse to WMA and overdrafts (ODs) in the \ufb01 rst week of July, the liquidity conditions moved to a surplus. Fine-tuning term reverse repo auctions \u2013 the key instrument for absorbing surpluses \u2013 exceeded `1 trillion around this time. Easy liquidity conditions persisted in early August, reaching near balance when the Reserve Bank transferred its surplus to the Government on August 11. With government spending picking up, subdued currency demand during July and August, and proactive front-loading of liquidity by the Reserve Bank in anticipation of potential pressure associated with redemptions of FCNR(B) deposits kept liquidity conditions in surplus mode. In the early part of September, with the Government resorting to WMA again, the net LAF absorption reached `1 trillion. In anticipation of liquidity pressures arising from advance tax payments in September, the Reserve Bank conducted an OMO purchase auction of `100 billion on September 8. Liquidity de\ufb01 cit returned to a surplus mode by the end of the month. Structural and cyclical factors impeding transmission to bank lending rates, particularly stressed balance require a review of the MCLR implementation by banks, given the context of signi\ufb01 cant softening of would continue to manage liquidity proactively and taking timely and appropriate measures to insulate Global economic activity and trade remain subdued in 2016 so far. While advanced economies (AEs) confront persisting slack and low inflation, several key emerging market economies (EMEs) have had to contend with slower economic activity and sluggish investment. Since the MPR of April 2016, global growth and trade have weakened and new risks to the outlook have slanted the balance further to the downside. Industrial activity, in particular, has slumped, going into contraction in some AEs. Rising protectionism is threatening to accentuate the compression of trade volumes. While commodity prices have \ufb01 rmed up, the outlook remains subdued. Crude oil prices rose to a recent peak in Q2 of 2016 but mostly on supply disruptions across geographies. In Q3, this upturn has been curbed by higher inventories. Prices of precious metals have been buoyed by safe haven demand, a telling insight into the state of the global economy. Food prices remain elevated on harvest failures in several parts of the world. In\ufb02 ation remains subdued in AEs and has started to edge down in EMEs. International \ufb01 nancial markets were shocked by the outcome of Brexit referendum in Q2, with equity markets plunging worldwide, currency volatility heightening and investors herding into safe havens. Markets quickly stabilised, and moved up in Q3. However, incoming data can dispel this uneasy calm, as the uptick in bond yields \u2013 out of a widening negative universe \u2013 in the run-up to the Fed\u2019s September meeting has shown. Equity prices regained lost ground and currencies recovered, but uncertainty surrounding the monetary policy stances of systemic central banks will likely continue to impart volatility to currency and equity markets. Capital \ufb02 ows are returning to EMEs, though foreign direct investment has not sustained the pace it achieved a year ago. The US economy slowed in the \ufb01 rst half of 2016, despite the higher than expected upturn in Q2. The impetus from private consumption, non-residential \ufb01 xed investment and exports was offset by drops in inventory accumulation, residential \ufb01 xed investment and government spending. Investment in Q2 declined for three consecutive quarters as companies cut back spending on oil wells, equipment and inventories. In Q3, factory activity contracted for the \ufb01 rst time in six months in August amidst slumping orders and production. Labor market conditions, on the other hand, rebounded to positive territory in July from a six-month slump and continued to improve in the rest of Q3 with low levels of layoffs in August and a drop in jobless claims to a two-month low in September. In the Euro area, growth decelerated from Q1 to Q2, both sequentially and y-o-y. Net exports and consumer spending supported growth, but \ufb01 xed investment and inventories operated as drags. Industrial production contracted in July. The re-emergence of stress in some parts of the banking sector in Q3 tightened \ufb01 nancial conditions. However, economic sentiment improved in September in its major economies. The Japanese economy decelerated in Q2 after a modest improvement in Q1, as weak domestic consumption and sluggish external demand prompted companies to cut capital spending. In the UK, economic growth was stronger in Q2 than Q1, even as industrial growth was partly offset by a fall in construction activity. The outlook for Q3 is subdued with the fuller effects of Brexit yet to play out (Table V.1). Among major EMEs, growth performance in recent quarters remains divergent. The recent uptick in commodity prices has provided some relief to commodity exporters, while net terms of trade gains for commodity importers are moderating. In China, growth held steady at 6.7 per cent y-o-y in Q2 on the back of strong policy stimulus. Private investment growth, however, shrank to a record low. In Q3, factory output and retail sales grew faster than expected in August, underpinned by housing market and government infrastructure spending. By contrast, the Brazilian economy continues to face deep recession in the midst of political uncertainty undermining consumer and business con\ufb01 dence, but the recent uptick in commodity prices could alleviate P : Projection, * year-on-year, **: Seasonally Unadjusted.

In Russia, recessionary conditions are diminishing as re\ufb02 ected in the economy contracting at a slower rate in Q2 on the support of a modest pick- up in the industrial sector and transportation services. The South African economy continued to weaken in Q2, following a contraction in Q1, due to slowing demand from China and low commodity prices. China and India are projected to contribute more than half of global growth in 2016 (Chart V.1). The OECD\u2019s composite leading indicators point to stable growth in the US, the Euro area and Japan, and a pick up in growth momentum in China, Russia, Brazil and India (Chart V.2). Global trade decelerated further in H1 of 2016 in an environment of subdued demand and rising uncertainties protectionism, exacerbated surrounding Brexit, the Fed\u2019s monetary policy stance and volatile \ufb01 nancial markets (Chart V.3a). While the pace of contraction in trade volume of EMEs reduced markedly in Q2, the slowdown in the trade volume of AEs has continued since Q1 of 2015. Within EMEs, trade volume contracted in all major regions in Q2, except Central and Eastern Europe where weakening currencies have given a signi\ufb01 cant boost to exports. The pace of contraction reduced sharply in Emerging Asia, with currency depreciation supporting exports in a number of countries, and stimulus driven demand boosting imports in China (Chart V.3b). The World Trade Organisation projects that global trade volume growth in 2016 would be the lowest since the global \ufb01 nancial crisis. Global commodity prices have been largely driven by supply conditions even as demand remains soft, barring those of precious metals lifted by safe haven buying. Crude oil prices rallied between January and May on account of supply disruptions in several OPEC countries and North America and a softening of the US dollar, but eased thereafter on the build- up of inventories, particularly in the US. Prices have remained range bound since early September (Chart V.4a). Prices of precious metals have rallied on strong investor demand, weak dollar and safe haven buying. Persistently weak US economic data have been driving up investment demand for precious metals, with Brexit providing a further boost. Post Brexit, gold prices surged to a two-year high and have remained elevated so far. Iron ore prices, which soared in 2016 due to stimulus and property boom driven demand from China, have subsided lately due to increased supply from Brazil and Australia. Food prices have been generally trended upwards since January 2016, with sugar, in particular, showing a sharp increase due to drought in Brazil (Chart V.4b). Global in\ufb02 ationary pressures remain contained by weak global growth and soft commodity prices. In AEs, the general price level remained virtually unchanged despite monetary easing, although core in\ufb02 ation was \ufb01 rmer (Chart V.5a). In the US, barring medical care and shelter, most of the remaining sectors of the economy faced negative price pressures. In the Euro area, de\ufb02 ation risks increased as the economic outlook deteriorated and business and consumer sentiment weakened, with declining energy prices, strengthening of the euro, subdued wage growth and weak productivity growth accentuating these risks. Japan has also remained in de\ufb02 ation mode for the past \ufb01 ve months, induced by faltering consumption and an unrelentingly strong yen. By contrast, in\ufb02 ation remains diverse among major EMEs. In Brazil, Russia and South Africa, in\ufb02 ation has been well above the target due to weak currency, food in\ufb02 ation and structural rigidities, though these pressures have been easing in recent months. On the other hand, China, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand face benign and ebbing in\ufb02 ationary situations (Chart V.5b). By and large, in\ufb02 ation in EMEs has bene\ufb01 tted from low commodity prices, ebbing currency depreciation pressures and slack in demand, both at home and abroad (Box V.1). Exchange rate and commodity prices are two important transmission channels of in\ufb02 ation across open economies. By what percentage in\ufb02 ation changes in response to a percentage change in exchange rate and commodity prices \u2013 the pass-through \u2013 is, however, determined by several factors, of which the credibility of monetary policy in anchoring in\ufb02 ation expectations is an important one (Taylor, 2000). It is imperative to have a good measure of this pass-through in order to understand the in\ufb02 ationary process and fashion appropriate monetary policy responses. In this context, recent years have seen increased EME currency volatility, driven by policy and political uncertainties emanating from several parts of the globe. There has also been a signi\ufb01 cant decline in global commodity prices, particularly crude oil, following supply-demand mismatches, though supply disruptions have led to some \ufb01 rming up since January 2016. How much of these currency and commodity prices movements have in\ufb02 uenced in\ufb02 ation in some select EMEs is examined by estimating a reduced form equation derived from a partial equilibrium micro-founded pricing behavior of \ufb01 rms. Speci\ufb01 cally, the pricing decision of a \ufb01 rm is determined by marginal costs, mark-ups, exchange rate changes, wage costs and income in the exporting and importing countries. In reduced form, this can be speci\ufb01 ed as: where, p= consumer prices; e = exchange rate; c = costs; pc = commodity prices (crude oil), y = income (demand) and superscripts d and f are domestic and foreign country, respectively. 0.09* 0.12* 0.09* 0.03* 0.02* 0.04* 0.02 Staff estimates; *Signi\ufb01 cant at 5 per cent; **Signi\ufb01 cant at 10 per cent; Dep^: Depreciation; App^: Appreciation; ec: error correction; ERPT: exchange rate pass-through. Note: Long-run cointegration is estimated using dynamic ordinary least squares and the short-run using Arellano-Bond generalised method of moments. The Sargan test for over indentifying restrictions and Arellano-Bond autocorrelation test are found to be satisfactory for all the models. Estimates carried out in difference form for a panel of 17 EMEs1 employing a battery of estimation methods for the period 2005:Q1 to 2016:Q2 reveal that exchange rates, commodity prices, exporting country\u2019s costs and domestic demand in\ufb02 uence in\ufb02 ation in these EMEs (Table 1). However, the extent of this in\ufb02 uence has declined in the post-crisis period, even while in\ufb02 ation has become more persistent. The pass-through of exchange rate depreciation is far stronger than that of appreciation. Despite the weakening of pass-through, in\ufb02 ation in EMEs has bene\ufb01 tted from the decline in commodity prices and relative currency stability in the post-crisis period.

In Q3 so far, some AEs have eased further, as Brexit paralysed markets and added to global uncertainty. The Fed has kept its policy rate unchanged since end-2015; however, in its September meeting, it indicated that the case for a rate hike has strengthened. After pausing for several months, both the UK and Japan have renewed monetary easing as a response to Brexit. The Bank of England cut its policy rate in August and also expanded its asset purchase programme. The Bank of Japan doubled its exchange traded funds (ETF) purchases in July to contain the surge in yen to an almost two year high. In September, it shifted its policy focus from targeting base money to targeting 10-year government bond yields at zero per cent. The ECB has kept its monetary policy stance unchanged since the last cut in the policy rate in March 2016. Monetary policy stances in EMEs have varied. South Korea and Indonesia cut policy rates in Q2, with the latter easing further in September to support the economy as expectations of a rate increase by the US Fed diminished. Russia cut its policy rate by 50 basis points each in June and September on ebbing in\ufb02 ationary pressures. In contrast, Colombia and Mexico increased policy rates by 200 bps and 150 bps, respectively, during 2016 so far to counter in\ufb02 ationary pressures emanating from depreciating currencies. Brazil kept its policy rate unchanged in the face of a crippling recession even though in\ufb02 ation remained well above the target (Charts V.6a & b). Global \ufb01 nancial markets rebounded from mid- February through June 23 as positive sentiments prevailed due to continuing accommodative monetary policy stances by central banks in AEs and the widely held expectation that the UK would remain in the European Union. Better than expected global economic conditions, recovery in oil price, stimulus in China, and pushing back of a rate hike by the US Fed reinforced the calm in the \ufb01 nancial markets. The unexpected outcome of the Brexit referendum surprised \ufb01 nancial markets in June. The initial reactions were severe with large movements in bond yields, equity prices and exchange rates. However, \ufb01 nancial markets stabilised quickly, stock markets climbed to intra-year highs in August, and bond yields came off recent lows with volatility easing. Equity markets gained steadily during Q2 of 2016, as risk sentiment improved despite Brexit uncertainties and US economic data providing mixed signals. However, the sharp sell-off around the world triggered by Brexit on June 23 led to a record loss of US$ 3 trillion in market capitalisation in the next two trading days. Volatility surged immediately, but also receded quickly when markets realised that the exit would be a long drawn process. Equity markets subsequently recouped losses, barring UK and European banks. Japanese equity markets rebounded quickly as various measures to stabilise markets were announced. Euro area equity prices, which dropped by around 9 per cent immediately after Brexit, gradually returned to mid-June levels. The impact was less pronounced in the US, as market expected a delay in policy tightening by the Fed even as US payrolls data and corporate earnings beat expectations. EME equity markets performed relatively well in Q2 of 2016 supported by global low policy rates and low volatility. In May, they were impacted by anticipation of a rate hike by the Fed and concerns relating to growth and political risks in some economies. The initial risk-off and \ufb02 ight-to-safety response to the Brexit referendum in June was fully offset by mid- July. In Q3, equity prices have gained by about 4.4 per cent in AEs and 8.3 per cent in EMEs (Chart V.7). Sovereign bond yields, which had been falling in major AEs, rose in the later part of April due to a global sell-off triggered from Europe, which spread to the US. In May, bond markets traded range-bound, though US treasury securities remained more attractive relative to sovereign securities of other AEs offering negative yields. Post Brexit, increased risk-off behaviour of investors led to a sharp fall in bond yields across major AEs that continued till about mid-July. Thereafter, yields recovered and hardened till mid-September on concerns over major central banks\u2019 ability to continue with unconventional asset purchases. They have recently softened again after the FOMC held rates unchanged in September. Bond yields in EMEs have also eased, buoyed by dovish monetary policy stances of some central banks and rise in commodity prices. In\ufb02 ows to EME bond markets were modest in May on rising prospects of a Fed rate hike and concerns about growth and political risks in a number of EMEs. However, in June, in\ufb02 ows turned up sharply following dovish signals from the ECB and reduced expectations on tightening by the US Fed, barring some transitory sell-offs around the Brexit referendum. The search for yields in the bond markets of EMEs has further intensi\ufb01 ed in Q3, with investors taking advantage of record low interest rates in AEs and chasing carry trade. Consequently, yields consistently eased in major EMEs, except in Turkey and South Africa. In currency markets, the divergence in growth and monetary policy in AEs remained the major driving factors. The US dollar depreciated against trading partner currencies during March to late April, largely re\ufb02 ecting revised expectations on the path of the US policy rate. It strengthened subsequently with the widening of long-term bond yield spreads between the US and the Euro area.

The pound sterling, which strengthened against the US dollar in April, started weakening in May on Brexit concerns and fell sharply on the day of the outcome. Since then, it has depreciated by 12.4 per cent against the US dollar (Chart V.8). Emerging market currencies have remained susceptible to both global and domestic factors. While the Chinese renminbi has depreciated modestly since April, the Turkish lira and the Mexican peso have weakened signi\ufb01 cantly. The South African rand has turned weaker since mid-August due to economic weakness and escalation of political concerns. By contrast, the Brazilian real gained against the US dollar in Q2 and Q3, driven by global liquidity, bottoming commodity prices and changing domestic political dynamics. The Russian ruble, which rallied between January and June, has stabilised, barring some pressures in mid-July and early August due to bearish oil market conditions and political tensions. In sum, risks to global economic activity and trade are skewed to the downside. While EMEs seem to be recovering, growth in major AEs remains subdued. In\ufb02 ation is expected to remain benign. Financial markets, despite the recent calm, remain vulnerable to swings in investor sentiment, driven by policy and political uncertainty. ", "file8": "Underneath current benign inflation conditions, there are broad-based inflation pressures, which make the inflation outlook for 2017-18 challenging. Growth in real gross value added is expected to accelerate in 2017-18, underpinned by strong consumption demand even as investment activity remains muted and external demand uncertain. Under the monetary policy framework ushered in by amendments to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, the monetary policy decision has been vested in a six member monetary policy committee (MPC). Following its decision to lower the policy repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) at the time of the October 2016 Monetary Policy Report (MPR), the MPC decided to hold the policy rate in the December 2016 and February 2017 meetings of its bi-monthly schedule. Four features distinguish these initial decisions under the new regime. First, there was a calibrated shift in the policy stance from accommodative to neutral. Second, there was an overwhelming preference for waiting out the transitory effects of demonetisation and the unsettled political climate globally. Third, each decision was taken by unanimity. Fourth, within the consensus, members\u2019 decisions appear to have been driven by individualistic approaches to arriving at them, as revealed in their written public statements. The recent experience of MPCs in the UK, Sweden, Brazil, Thailand, Czech Republic and Hungary suggests that rate decisions have been based on unanimity (Chart I.1). Other recent cases in point are the decisions of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in its December 2016 and February 2017 meetings, and the Bank of England\u2019s MPC in its meetings during October-February. Differences have been typically confined to the size of the change in the policy rate rather than contesting the overarching policy stance.1 Existing research on monetary policy decision making suggests that divergences stem mainly from (i) MPC members\u2019 policy preferences \u2013 the relative weight on price stability and output stabilisation \u2013 in their reaction functions, and (ii) assessment of expected economic conditions \u2013 the evolution of inflation and output gaps.2,3 Does the formative experience of the MPC in India suggest similar policy preferences and assessments of the outlook? It is too early to tell. 1 Riboni, Alessandro and Francisco Ruge-Murcia (2014), \u201cDissent in Monetary Policy Decisions\u201d, Journal of Monetary Economics, 66, pp.137-154.

The analysis of macroeconomic developments presented in chapters II and III explains why both inflation and output growth have undershot the forecasts set out in the October 2016 MPR. In part, these deviations reflect the impact of demonetisation. Turning to the outlook, recent domestic and global events warrant revisions to the baseline assumptions on initial conditions set out in the October 2016 MPR (Table I.1). First, international crude oil prices have fluctuated widely over the last six months, hardening initially on the back of the agreement by Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to curtail production becoming credible.4 More recently, these prices have eased with shale production stepping up, US inventories rising sizeably and a vast amount of past supply.5 Nonetheless, oil prices are now ruling around 10 per cent above the level (US$ 46 per barrel) assumed in October 2016. Domestic petrol and diesel prices increased by around `5.5 per litre and `4.2 per litre, respectively, between November 2016 and February 2017 and were cut by around `4.9 per litre and `3.5 per litre, respectively, effective April 1, 2017 (Chart I.2). To remain within BE 2016-17 (3.5 per cent) To remain within BE 2017-18 (3.2 per cent) Second, the foreign exchange market has experienced international bouts of volatility developments. The Indian rupee depreciated sharply vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar during November 8-28, 2016 in the aftermath of the US presidential election results. Since then, the rupee has recovered lost ground and appreciated beyond the October 2016 level (`67 per USD). triggered by Notes: 1. Crude oil (Indian basket) represents a derived basket comprising sour grade (Oman and Dubai average) and sweet grade (Brent) crude oil processed in Indian refineries in the ratio of 71:29. Third, global growth and trade have evolved at a sluggish pace, as expected. Looking ahead, their pace is expected to accelerate modestly in 2017, benefitting from the expected fiscal stimulus in the US and the strengthening recovery from recent macroeconomic strains in major emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). A sobering thought, however, is that global growth has repeatedly disappointed initial expectations in the past few years (Chart I.3). Consequently, downside risks suffuse the domestic outlook for 2017-18. 4 On November 30, 2016, OPEC members agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d) to 32.5 mb/d, effective January 1, 2017. 5 Rising output from countries not included in OPEC accord is also reported to be undermining the effectiveness of the deal (\u201cOil\u2019s Promised Land Slips Away on OPEC Leaks\u201d, Bloomberg, February 5, 2017). low Headline levels during November 2016-February 2017, much lower than projected in the October 2016 MPR. Yet, the persistence of inflation excluding food and fuel inflation declined to significantly poses a challenge to the inflation outlook. Also, there is considerable uncertainty as to how prices will pan out over the coming months. As vegetable price declines were likely on account of demonetisation- driven distress sales in addition to seasonal factors,6 remonetisation could fuel a sharp reversal in vegetable prices, going forward. This development imparts uncertainty to the near-term outlook for inflation. Households inflation expectations adaptively, based on past movements in salient prices, especially those of food and fuel. The March 2017 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of urban households indicated an increase of 20-50 bps in inflation expectations over the December round, reversing partly the sharp decline of 2-3 percentage points recorded in the previous (i.e., December) round. Three months and one year ahead inflation expectations were 7.5 per cent and 8.8 per cent, respectively. The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate also edged higher (Chart I.4). firms surveyed in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey in its January-March 2017 round (Chart I.5). Staff costs in the manufacturing sector are also expected to increase in Q1:2017-18. Nominal wage growth in rural areas decelerated in December- January, partly on account of demonetisation. Manufacturing and services sector firms in Nikkei\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 survey for March 2017 reported pressures from both input prices and output prices. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in March 2017 expected CPI inflation to pick up The hardening of global oil, metal and other commodity prices that is driving the recent surge in India\u2019s wholesale inflation is imparting input price pressures for firms. Pricing power is also expected to improve, as reflected by manufacturing 6 While headline inflation moderated to 3.2 per cent in January 2017, inflation excluding vegetables was 4.5 per cent. Taking into account the revised baseline assumptions, (five years ahead) increased marginally by 10 bps to 4.8 per cent. Their longer-term inflation expectations RBI staff\u2019s baseline path for headline CPI inflation is (10 years ahead) remained unchanged at 4.5 per cent, expected to take it from its current level of 3.7 per cent close to the Reserve Bank\u2019s medium-term inflation per cent in Q2. It is then forecast to edge higher to Timely and reliable forecasts of inflation are critical inputs for setting forward-looking monetary policy. Forecasting inflation is challenging in all countries, both advanced and emerging, but it is rendered tenuous in emerging economies on account of recurrent supply shocks. Most central banks, therefore, use a suite of models, supplemented with informed judgement, for obtaining reasonably robust forecasts. Underlying this preference is a tacit recognition that all models are mis- specified in some dimension and at some time points. In this context, a forecast combination approach \u2013 combining forecasts from alternative models through a judicious weighting system \u2013 finds favour among practitioners. Forecast combinations can act as a useful hedge against bad forecast performance of individual models, especially when inflation is volatile (Hubrich and Skudelny, 2017). vis-\u00e0-vis individual models, the following eight time series models are analysed: (i) a random walk (RW) model; (ii) a first-order autoregression (AR) model; (iii) a Phillips curve (PC) model; (iv) a moving average model with stochastic volatility (MA-SV); (v) a three-variable vector autoregression (VAR) model; (vi) a three-variable VAR with one exogenous variable (VARX) model; (vii) a Bayesian VAR (BVAR) model; and (viii) a Bayesian VARX (BVARX) model.7 Three approaches are used for combining the forecasts of the individual models: (i) a simple average of individual model forecasts; (ii) a performance-based weighted average, based on time varying weights (TVW) derived from the individual forecast performance of the past three years; and (iii) time varying geometrically backward decaying weights (TV-GDW) (i.e., a larger weight is given to the model\u2019s recent performance). Quarterly data from Q1:2000 to Q3:2016 are used to estimate these models. In order to empirically validate if a forecast combination approach in the Indian context shows promising results 7 The VAR and BVAR models have three endogenous variables [output growth, CPI inflation and the policy repo rate], while the VARX and BVARX models have four variables [three endogenous variables (as defined previously) and one exogenous (oil prices) variable]. For a truly pseudo-real out-of-sample comparative assessment, the exogenous variables (oil price in the VARX/BVARX models and output gap in the Phillips curve model) for the out-of-sample forecasting horizon are modelled as AR processes. Notes: 1. Charts above represent the ratio of RMSE of individual models and combination models vis-\u00e0-vis the benchmark RW model. 2. RW: Random Walk Model; AR: first-order Autoregression Model; PC: Phillips Curve; MA-SV: Moving Average Model with Stochastic Volatility; Forecast performance is measured by the inverse of the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of individual models and their combinations (relative to the benchmark RW model) for two alternative forecasting horizons (one quarter ahead and four quarters ahead) (Chart 1). The results suggest that (a) performance-based forecast combinations improve over both individual models and simple averaging; (b) the relative forecasting performance improves considerably as the horizon is extended from one quarter to four quarters, a feature especially helpful from the monetary policy perspective, given transmission lags. Overall, the results suggest that combining forecasts from a range of models outperforms an individual model. This is the approach that RBI staff adopts, as explained in the September 2015 MPR. 5.1 per cent in Q3 on account of the demonetisation- induced base effect before moderating to 4.9 per cent in Q4:2017-18, with risks evenly balanced around this trajectory (the 50 per cent confidence interval for inflation in Q4:2017-18 is in a range of 3.4-6.4 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence interval is in a range of 2.6-7.2 per cent) (Chart I.7). Forecasts from the structural model indicate that inflation may evolve in a stable manner through 2018-19 and reach 4.6 per cent in Q4:2018-19 under the baseline scenario, with the monetary policy stance remaining unchanged. There are three major upside risks to the baseline inflation path \u2013 uncertainty in crude oil prices; exchange rate volatility due to global financial market developments, especially if political risks materialise; and implementation of the house rent allowances under the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award. The likely impact of these shocks to headline inflation is explored in Section I.3. The proposed introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) in 2017-18 also poses some uncertainty for the baseline inflation path, particularly on account of one- off but somewhat uncertain duration of price effects that are typically associated with the introduction of taxes on value added in the cross-country experience (see the October 2016 MPR for a review). With the effects of demonetisation turning out to be short-lived and modest relative to some doomsday expectations, the outlook for 2017-18 has been brightened considerably by a number of factors. First, with the accelerated pace of remonetisation, discretionary consumer spending held back by demonetisation is expected to have picked up from Q4:2016-17 and will gather momentum over several quarters ahead. The recovery will also likely be aided by the reduction in banks\u2019 lending rates due to large inflows of current and savings accounts (CASA) deposits, although the fuller transmission impact might be impeded by stressed balance sheets of banks and the tepid demand for bank credit. Second, various proposals in the Union Budget 2017-18 are expected to be growth stimulating: stepping up of capital expenditure; boosting the rural economy and affordable housing; the planned roll-out of the GST; and steps to attract higher foreign direct investment (FDI) through initiatives like abolishing the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). Turning to forward-looking surveys, the consumer confidence moderated in the March 2017 round of Reserve Bank\u2019s survey (Chart I.8). Respondents were less optimistic about the prospects for economic conditions, employment, and income a year ahead. Sentiment in the corporate sector improved during January-March 2017, according to the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey (Chart I.9). The improvement was led by optimism on future production, order books, exports, employment, financial situation, selling prices and profit margin. Amounts mobilised Third, global trade and output are expected to expand at a stronger pace in 2017 and 2018 than in recent years, easing the external demand constraint on domestic growth prospects. However, the recent increase in the global commodity prices, if sustained, could have a negative impact on our net commodity importing domestic economy. Finally, the pace of economic activity would critically hinge upon the outturn of the south-west monsoon, especially in view of the rising probability being assigned to an el ni\u00f1o event in July-August, 2017. through initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent months and filings of red herring prospectuses with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) have been higher, which suggest investment optimism in the period ahead. Both manufacturing and services firms expected output to be higher a year from now, according to the purchasing managers\u2019 survey for March 2017. Surveys conducted by other agencies indicate a decline in optimism over their previous rounds (Table I.2). Repo Rate (end period) Yield of 91-day Treasury Bills (end period) Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in March 2017 expected real GVA growth to accelerate from 6.5 per cent in Q4:2016-17 to 7.6 per cent in Q4:2017-18, led by growth in services and industry (Chart I.10 and Table I.3). @: Median forecasts; GNDI: Gross National Disposable Income. Sources: RBI staff estimates; and Survey of Professional Forecasters (March 2017). Considering the baseline assumptions, the fast pace of remonetisation, survey indicators and updated that real GVA growth will improve from 6.6 per cent in Q1:2017-18 and 7.4-7.6 per cent in the remaining three quarters of 2017-18, with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path (Chart I.11). Looking beyond 2017-18 and assuming a normal monsoon, a congenial global environment, no policy induced model estimates yield real GVA growth of 8.1 per cent The baseline projections of growth and inflation presented in the preceding section are based on the assumptions set out in Table I.1. As usual, there are uncertainties surrounding these assumptions which could produce deviations from baseline projections. This section assesses the sensitivity of the projected baseline paths of growth and inflation to plausible alternate scenarios. Conversely, if some of the OPEC members do not adhere to the agreed production cuts and/or the shale gas producers continue to ramp up production, global prices could soften below the baseline. Should crude prices slip under this scenario to around US$ 45 per barrel by 2017-18, inflation could moderate by around 15 bps with growth benefitting by around 5 bps. The baseline scenario assumes that global growth will accelerate during 2017 and 2018. Risks to the baseline could emanate from: (a) US fiscal expansion being less The September 2016 announcement by OPEC of agreement on production cuts by members was met with scepticism. The signing of the agreement in end-November, however, led to a sharp jump in global crude oil prices. If OPEC sticks to the agreed production cuts of 1.2 mb/day till the next review of the agreement in May 2017, and the global crude oil production balance moves to a deficit by Q1:2017-18,8 upside risk to the crude oil trajectory over baseline estimates will heighten. Any supply disruptions due to geo-political developments could accentuate these upside risks. Assuming that crude prices increase to around US$ 60 per barrel under this scenario, inflation could be higher by around 30 bps and growth could be weaker by around 10 bps (Charts I.12 and I.13). than expected or marked by delays; (b) the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy response to expansionary fiscal policy being larger than expected, especially in the context of a recent assessment that the US economy is \u201cclosing in on full employment\u201d; (c) the now pervasive spectre of protectionism affecting global trade; (d) continued concerns over the Chinese credit cycle; (e) volatile global crude oil and commodity prices; and (f) the implications of all these factors for international financial markets. Feedback loops can exaggerate the impact of several of these factors on global growth.9 Assuming that global growth in 2017 and 2018 remains the same as was recorded in 2016 (i.e., 30-50 bps below the baseline assumption), real GVA growth and inflation could turn out to be around 20 bps and 10 bps, respectively, below the baseline. the US presidential elections, the risk of renewed turbulence in global financial markets on account of global downsides materialising and associated volatility in domestic financial markets remains a clear and present danger to the Indian economy. A five per cent depreciation of the Indian rupee, relative to the baseline assumption, could push up inflation by 10-15 bps in 2017-18. The depreciation, however, could have a favourable impact on growth in 2017-18 through a boost to net exports. In contrast, the combination of a benign global macroeconomic and financial environment, the expected acceleration in domestic growth and the policy initiatives to attract FDI flows can lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency, with a soothing impact on domestic inflation. A five per cent appreciation of the Indian rupee, relative to the baseline assumption, could soften inflation by 10-15 bps in 2017-18. The pace of global economic activity could be higher if the policy stimulus in the US turns out to be larger than currently expected. In this scenario, assuming global growth is 50 bps higher, domestic growth could turn out to be around 25 bps above the baseline. Inflation could be higher by around 10 bps on the back of higher domestic demand as also imported impulses from higher global commodity prices. The 7th CPC recommended an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) of 8-24 per cent of basic pay. The higher HRA would have a direct and immediate impact on headline CPI through an increase in housing inflation. Assuming a rate of increase in the HRA as proposed by the 7th CPC is implemented from early 2017-18 onwards and the State Governments implement a similar order of increase with a lag of one quarter, CPI inflation could be 100-150 bps higher than the baseline for 2017-18.10 The HRA impact on inflation is expected to persist for 6-8 quarters, with the peak effect occurring around 3-4 quarters from implementation. In addition, indirect effects could occur from elevated inflation expectations. Recognising that the domestic foreign exchange market witnessed heightened volatility in the aftermath of Rainfall dependence of Indian agriculture makes the broader economy vulnerable to monsoon outcomes. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is yet to release its forecast of the south-west monsoon for 2017. Hence, the baseline scenario assumes a normal south-west monsoon. However, the occurrence of el ni\u00f1o is assuming a rising probability, as stated earlier, dampening the prospects of agricultural production.11 Assuming the growth of output of agriculture and allied activities suffers by one percentage point, overall GVA growth could be lower by around 20 bps in 2017-18. The concomitant increase in food prices could result in headline inflation rising 30 bps above the baseline. To sum up, economic activity should recover in 2017- 18 on the back of the fast pace of remonetisation and the government\u2019s focus on capital expenditure, rural economy and housing. The global economic environment may improve modestly, albeit amidst several uncertainties. Headline inflation is projected to increase during 2017-18, calling for close vigilance and readiness for an appropriate monetary policy response, if warranted. 9 Kose, M. Ayhan, Csilla Lakatos, Franziska Ohnsorge and Marc Stocker (2017), \u201cThe Global Role of the U.S. Economy: Linkages, Policies and Spill- overs\u201d, Policy Research Working Paper 7962, World Bank. 10 This increase in inflation will be the statistical direct effect of higher HRA, as house rents have a weight of 9.5 per cent in the CPI. 11 In March 2017, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) indicated increasing odds (50-55 per cent) for el ni\u00f1o forming towards the second half of 2017, while the Australian Bureau of Meteorology assessed the likelihood of el ni\u00f1o forming in 2017 at approximately 50 per cent. Consumer price inflation has eased significantly, mainly due to the large decline in food inflation, especially vegetables. Excluding food and fuel, however, inflation has remained sticky. Input costs have firmed up and pose upside risks to the path of inflation going forward. The MPR of October 2016 had projected CPI inflation1 moving in a narrow range of 5.0 to 5.3 per cent during Q3 and Q4 of 2016-17, on expectations of food inflation moderating and crude prices remaining benign. Food inflation came off its July 2016 peak and eased during August-October 2016. The shock of demonetisation, however, veered the inflation trajectory sharply below its projected path, essentially on account of an abrupt compression in food inflation. Prices of vegetables sank into deflation and pulled down headline inflation during November 2016-January 2017. Notwithstanding the hardening of global crude oil prices in the wake of the agreement on production cuts by OPEC in late November, the negative wedge between actual and projected inflation widened through the second half of 2016-17 (Chart II.1). Headline inflation fell off its July cliff and was already traversing a declining trajectory during August through October when demonetisation hit in November. It triggered a downward spiral that took inflation down to 3.2 per cent in January 2017, an all-time low in the history of all India CPI- Combined (Chart II.2). The entire fall in inflation during November 2016 to January 2017 can be explained by the deflation in prices of vegetables and pulses. As a result, unfavourable base effects, which should have raised headline inflation during December 2016 to January 2017, were overwhelmed by a collapse in the month-on-month (m-o-m) momentum, bringing down headline inflation by around 100 basis points (Chart II.3). In February, however, the drag from these transitory effects began to ebb and headline inflation edged up on a pickup in food and fuel price pressures. Despite the sharp fall in food inflation in the second half of the year, the distribution of inflation across all categories was largely centred around 4.5 per cent with continuing high kurtosis and a positive skew (Chart II.4). Diffusion indices for goods, services and the overall CPI were all well above 50 over the financial year, suggesting that even as headline inflation fell to a historic low, it was not broad-based (Chart II.5). 1 Headline inflation is measured by year-on-year changes in all-India CPI Combined (Rural+Urban). In retrospect, a historical decomposition shows that it was the large shock delivered by demonetisation and the associated wage shock that explained much of the overall change in the inflation trajectory in the second half of 2016-17. Past monetary policy tightening continued to have visceral effects in containing inflation (Chart II.6a). In contrast, firmer crude prices and gradually closing output gap turned out to be sources of upside pressures, masked by the size of the demonetisation shock. Non-food inflation remained stubbornly sticky, hardened by the unchanging contribution of durable goods and services to overall inflation for much of the financial year (Chart II.6b). Inflation in the food and beverages category (with a weight of 46 per cent of CPI) turned out to be the active component of overall inflation in the second half of 2016-17. Four factors stand out in the recent experience: First, prices of perishables played the most decisive role, even during the three months preceding immediately demonetisation. following demonetisation, perishables became even more prominent, with vegetable price movements becoming pivotal after a decline of 21 per cent during November 2016 to February 2017. Transactions in fruits and vegetables have always been cash intensive. Anecdotal evidence points to distress sales by farmers, given their perishable nature. Vegetable prices usually do exhibit a seasonal moderation during November- February every year; during the 2016-17 season, however, the decline in vegetable prices was more pronounced than in previous years. Second, the vegetable prices decline troughed in January 2017 and thereafter showed a m-o-m increase of 0.1 per cent in February. Third, the seasonal decline in prices of vegetables is typically driven by potato, onion and tomato prices, which together constitute close to 40 per cent of the vegetables index. This time around, potato and tomato prices did exhibit seasonal easing but what was noteworthy was the plunge in the prices of other vegetables \u2013 cabbage, cauliflower, palak/other leafy vegetables, brinjal, gourd, peas and beans \u2013 which usually contribute little to the observed seasonality (Chart II.7). Fourth, inflation in perishables excluding vegetables averaged 5 per cent since November, considerably above the average headline inflation (Chart II.8).2 The spatial and temporal dynamics of food prices post-demonetisation show that within the food group, the decline in vegetable prices was particularly large and seen across states and across wholesale and retail markets (Box II.1). Excluding vegetables, food inflation would have been higher by 2.7 percentage No commentary on inflation in the food and beverages category in the second half of 2016-17 would be complete without incorporating an analysis of the extraordinary developments in prices of pulses. With a weight of 5.2 per cent in the food group and only 2.4 per cent in the CPI, pulses contributed 13 per cent of the rising CPI inflation trajectory during the first half 2016-17. In the second half so far, prices of pulses turned into deflation and, with a contribution of (-) 2.5 per cent, aided in bringing down headline inflation to historic low in the CPI series. Inflation in arhar and urad, which had spiked pulses inflation during 2 The perishables index in CPI (weight of around 26 per cent) was constructed as a sub-index of frequently purchased items (with 7-day recall period) and includes items such as vegetables, egg, meat and fish, milk and products, fruits, and processed foods. Other perishables exclude vegetables. 12 State-wise CPI food inflation data for the period January 2013 to January 2017 were analysed at a monthly frequency in a panel framework in order to make a comparative assessment of spatial, temporal and intra-food group fixed effects in driving food inflation. Dynamic panel estimation1 was conducted on seasonally adjusted annualised m-o-m CPI food inflation. The results showed that while fixed effects were insignificant for most states, heterogeneity in inflation rates in sub-categories of food groups was significant. Even if the fiscal year 2016- 17 alone is considered, intra-food group fixed effects continued to remain significant for most groups. However, vegetables and pulses stood out in terms of magnitude and direction when compared with the usual patterns (Chart 1a and 1b). In the context of demonetisation, the panel analysis also showed significant time fixed effects for November 2016 brought about by vegetables, suggesting unusual decline in prices post demonetisation. Furthermore, the fall in retail vegetable prices seemed to have broadly mirrored the fall in wholesale prices post demonetisation. Daily seasonally adjusted prices of potato and tomato, available for 88 centres across India, were used for analysing vegetable price margins post demonetisation (9 November - 31 December 2016), and remonetisation (January - February 2017). 1: Estimated using Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond \u201csystem\u201d Generalised Method of Moments estimators. Using cluster analysis based on k-means clustering technique, the wholesale and retail prices were grouped into three major clusters \u2013 low, medium and high price clusters \u2013 based on the data of the pre-demonetisation period (September-October 2016). Post demonetisation, price moderation was observed across medium and high price clusters in the wholesale and retail markets. With progressive remonetisation, the prices in these vegetables started rising in both the wholesale and retail markets. The 45 degree line in Chart 2 represents the level where wholesale and retail prices are equal. In the case of tomato, retail prices fell even below wholesale prices for some centres, indicating a fall in retail margin post demonetisation. In the case of potato prices, the movement was mostly along and above the 45 degree line implying that margins were not impacted. The movement in margins* can also be seen from Chart 3. In the case of tomato, margins collapsed post demonetisation. As remonetisation progressed, margins rose again. These movements in margins were statistically significant**. In the case of potato, the analysis also showed that some centres experienced higher retail prices post demonetisation compared with wholesale prices, suggesting that in some cases the widening of retail-wholesale margins was centre-specific. 2015-16 and the beginning of 2016-17, declined sharply during September 2016 to February 2017 so much so that arhar prices at the mandi level in the major producing states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka dropped below the minimum support price (MSP). Gram prices, on the other hand, were an outlier, with inflation in this item rising dramatically before moderating in Q4:2016-17. After two consecutive years of production shortfall, adequate rainfall and better area coverage drove up pulses output during 2016-17 and mitigated price pressures considerably. Favourable supply side measures taken by the government such as imports at zero import duty3, extension in stock limit of pulses, raising MSPs in order to incentivise pulses production and maintaining buffer stocks also helped in reining in price pressures. Within the food group, there were upside price pressure points in sugar, cereals and other food items such as prepared meals. Slippage in production during 2015-16 and 2016-17 caused double-digit inflation in sugar prices during the year (Chart II.9a and b). Under cereals, inflation in respect of rice has eased during October 2016 - January 2017, while inflation in wheat continued to firm up. A number of price control measures have been undertaken by the government for containing the price rise in the case of sugar and edible oil, including imposition of stock- holding limits, discouraging exports, and reduction in import duty on certain edible oils. In the fuel group, the moderation in inflation in the first half of the financial year reversed and it picked up from December 2016, driven by LPG and kerosene. The rise in LPG broadly mirrored the turnaround in international LPG prices. In the case of kerosene, the uptick was driven by the increase in subsidised kerosene prices by a calibrated `0.25 per litre per month during July 2016 to February 2017, in addition to rising international prices. The weighted contribution of firewood and chips to overall fuel 3 In case of tur, the import duty has been increased to 10 per cent. 6 1 - r p A *The heat map visually elaborates the evolution of inflation.

CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained sticky at around 5 per cent during most of the second half of 2016-17 (Chart II.11a). Housing and \u2018clothing and footwear\u2019 sub-groups were the main contributors, accounting for 36.2 per cent of inflation in the category as a whole. Other upside pressures in the group emanated from the firming up of international crude oil prices since December 2016 and the lagged pass-through to domestic prices of petrol and diesel that are embedded in transport and communication. With excise duty increase of around `12 per litre for both petrol and diesel under additional revenue mobilisation (ARM) measures, the mark-up of domestic over global prices has become more pronounced. With softening of international crude oil prices since early February 2017, domestic pump prices of petrol and diesel were reduced with a lag in the beginning of April 2017 (Chart II.12). Excluding volatile components such as petrol and diesel, inflation in this group (CPI, excluding food and fuel) averaged 4.7 per cent between September 2016 and February 2017 (Chart II.11a). Some moderation in February came about on account of the goods component in this category \u2013 gold and silver in \u2018personal care and effects\u2019; pharmaceuticals in health; and garments in the clothing sub-groups \u2013 although more readings need to be monitored to assess whether this softening will endure (Chart II.13a). By contrast, the contribution of the services component in all these sub-groups remained sticky, especially housing and education services (Chart II.13b). Given the incidence of large and frequent supply shocks on food and non-food items, trimming the inflation distribution by removing specific portions of upper and lower tails of the distribution is widely used to assess underlying inflation movements, with the weighted median being a specific case of trimming. Trimmed means, the weighted median and exclusion- based measures of CPI inflation revealed a central tendency of 4.7 per cent during September 2016 to February 2017 (Chart II.11b). Notwithstanding some moderation in February, the downward inflexibility in inflation excluding food and fuel has infused significant upside risks into the near-term outlook. The direct and indirect impact on housing inflation of the 7th CPC house rent allowance award \u2013 once implemented by the Government \u2013 and the size and duration of the \u2018GST effect\u2019 are other upside risks to inflation in CPI in this category. An important development in the second half of 2016-17 is the divergence that has set in between inflation measured by the CPI and by other measures. This conveys valuable insights into the profile of CPI inflation as it evolves in the months ahead. Inflation measured by the sectoral consumer price indices undershot headline CPI inflation, reflecting, inter alia, the higher weight of food in the former as also the absence of items such as gold and silver that were recent pressure points. Inflation in terms of the wholesale price index (WPI) was closely co-moving with CPI inflation during October-December 2016, but it shot up in January and further in February to demonetisation and revealed its underlying trajectory in the February 2017 reading, cost push pressures appear to be coalescing. Domestic farm and non-farm input costs escalated significantly in the second half of 2016-17 on account of the rise in global crude oil prices, the firming up of metal prices and expectations of expansionary US fiscal spending (Chart II.15). close to three percentage points above CPI inflation, driven by a sharp pick-up in international commodity prices. GDP and GVA deflators rose in the beginning of the year, but edged down closer to CPI inflation from Q3:2016-17 (Chart II.14). Coal inflation surged in January and February, with Coal India Limited linking its premium quality coal to international prices which hardened on account of supply disruptions in Australia and China towards the end of 2016. Substantial price pressures were also observed in high speed diesel, naphtha, furnace oil, cotton yarn and fibres all of which drove up inflation in industrial input costs to the highest level since early 2011. In the farm sector, price increases relating to high speed diesel and pesticides, particularly weedicides, largely contributed to the upturn in farm input costs. An analysis based on the Supply and Use Table (SUT) of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) comprising 140 products/services and 66 industries shows that a one per cent increase in crude oil, metals and coal prices could translate into an increase in WPI inflation by 15 bps, 20 bps and 5 bps, respectively, and in CPI inflation by 6 bps, 7 bps and 2 bps, respectively.4 Even as retail inflation and its measurement by other metrics has shrugged off the transitory drag of 4 Using SUT, the first round pass-through impact of 1 per cent increase in domestic prices of certain commodities (due to international price pressure), is estimated on WPI inflation. Onward transmission from wholesale to retail inflation is then estimated in a vector autoregression (VAR) framework with the interest rate, WPI headline inflation and CPI headline inflation as endogenous variables.

Turning to wages and staff costs, rural wage growth for both agricultural and non-agricultural labourers picked up through October-November 2016 before moderating in December and January (Chart II.16). The divergence between agricultural and non-agricultural wage growth remains wide, reflecting the increase in demand for farm labour due to the invigoration of agricultural activity. In the organised sector, corporate sector performance points to a moderation in per employee staff cost of listed private sector companies (Chart II.17a). A caveat in interpreting these developments is that the value of production grew at a slower pace than staff costs pushing up unit labour costs (i.e., the ratio of staff cost to value of production) for both manufacturing the and moderation seen in the latest reading (Chart II.17b). Firms polled in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey reported a sharp pick-up in the cost of raw materials as also in staff cost. Most of the firms expect to pass on the increase in costs into selling prices. Similar sentiments about acceleration in input costs were reported by both manufacturing firms and service providers in purchasing managers\u2019 indices. Polled companies expect that the increase in costs will strengthen output price inflation. companies, notwithstanding Going forward, the inflation path will be shaped by the implementation of house rent allowances under the 7th CPC award and the introduction of the GST; both these developments are likely to provide a push to headline inflation, the impact of which could last for 12-18 months. Moreover, several parts of the corporate sector, which have been struggling with balance sheet stress for a protracted period, await a recovery in demand that will rekindle pricing power of firms so that they can rebuild their bottom lines. While input costs have firmed up, the outlook for inflation will hinge upon a reasonably accurate assessment of the quantum of input price increases that the firms may pass through to their output prices. Further, should the recent softening in crude oil prices \u2013 caused by build-up in oil stocks in the US, legacy oversupply from OPEC last year, and possible failure of production controls by OPEC and Russia \u2013 continue, inflation trajectory could soften. Finally, with the rising probability of el ni\u00f1o, as discussed in Chapter 1, the path of food inflation may be impacted by the outcome of the monsoon in the coming year and in this regard, supply management measures that have successfully led to deceleration in food inflation from double digits in 2012-13 and 2013-14 to close to 5 per cent in 2016-17 so far, will play a crucial role. The slowdown in aggregate demand, which set in at the beginning of H2:2015-16, became accentuated in H2: 2016-17, although consumption demand remained resilient. Aggregate supply conditions were underpinned by the robust performance of agriculture and steady government expenditure. Economic activity has been losing momentum since H2:2015-16 on a combination of structural and cyclical factors; in H2:2016-17, this trajectory was dented further by the transient impact of demonetisation. Both private and government consumption demand have held up well against this slowdown, together accounting for 90 per cent of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in H2:2016-17 on a weighted contribution basis. Investment demand, which had sunk into contraction in H1, recovered from Q3:2016- 17. Net exports have been growing strongly since Q3:2015-16 but in Q3:2016-17, they turned negative with imports starting to expand at a higher pace than exports as domestic demand strengthened. The ebullient rebound in agricultural activity on the back of normal monsoon and record foodgrains production have boosted rural incomes and supported consumption. In contrast, the modest pick-up in industry in H2:2016-17 and the slower growth in services suggests that investment demand is still sluggish. Going forward, implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the measures taken in the Union Budget to boost the rural economy, infrastructure, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and low cost housing should help invigorate domestic demand. However, a sustained revival of investment holds the key to stepping up the pace of economic activity closer to its medium-term potential. GDP growth would have slumped to 5.9 per cent in H2:2016-17 as against the headline print of 7.0 per cent1. Private consumption remained the mainstay of domestic demand, notwithstanding some deceleration expected in the last quarter of the year. On a seasonally adjusted basis, however, q-o-q growth suggests that the slowdown in aggregate demand bottomed out in Q3 and an upturn commenced in Q4 on the back of a tentative recovery in exports and investment (Chart III.1, Table III.1). Private final consumption expenditure remains the bedrock of domestic demand, contributing over half of overall GDP growth in H2:2016-17 (Chart III.2). Its underlying resilience stood out in the face of cash constraints of demonetisation, with data pointing to an acceleration of growth in this period on a sequential basis. The expansion of consumer purchasing power in this period can be explained by a combination of factors: improved rural consumption demand due to (i) robust agricultural activity; (ii) sharp uptick in Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) expenditure (15 per cent Aggregate demand measured by y-o-y changes in real GDP at market prices moderated through 2016-17, with the slowdown being pronounced in the second half of the year. Fiscal stimulus in the form of the 7th Central Pay Commission\u2019s (7th CPC) award supported aggregate demand strongly; without the support of government final consumption expenditure (GFCE), 1 Keeping in view the provision made by the Central Government for additional expenditure on account of pay and pension in its budget for 2016-17, its overall impact was estimated at around 30 bps in the GVA projected by the Reserve Bank for 2016-17 (RBI Annual Report, 2015-16).

In terms of lead indicators for estimating private final consumption expenditure, the surge in private consumption finds reflection in the acceleration in agriculture GVA, telephone connections, indirect tax collections and manufacturing index of industrial production (IIP) (Chart III.3). After four consecutive quarters of either sharp deceleration or contraction, gross fixed capital formation turned around in Q3 and accelerated further in Q42. On the basis of lead indicators, this reversal in investment demand in spite of demonetisation effects can be explained by the pick-up in capital goods imports and moderation in the pace of contraction in domestic capital goods production as also improvement in profits of software companies (Chart III.4). Some momentum in investment activity is also visible in sectors such as electricity transmission, roads and renewable power. Nonetheless, it may be premature to interpret these proximate developments as green shoots of durable revival of investment demand. A wider scan shows that capex spending, especially in large brownfield projects in sectors such as iron and steel, construction, textiles and power, remains weak amidst an environment of uncertainty surrounding growth, both global and capacity in many sectors. According to the Centre for proposals, which capture the future pace of investment activity, has recovered in Q4 from its decadal low level in Q3, driven by government projects. The new investment projects increased to `2.57 trillion preceding nine quarters (Chart III.5a). The value of stalled projects decreased by 51 per cent during the quarter, mainly accounted for by government sector projects (Chart III.5b). The problem of stalled projects continues mainly because of lack of environmental Seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation has remained below its average (since Q1:2013-14), reflecting weak demand and raising concerns on the sustainability of the recent pick-up in private investment (Chart III.6). Decomposition of time series into trend and cycles of various frequencies, juxtaposed with a Markov switching exercise to detect regime shifts also suggests that the recent upturn may not yet confirm a definitive reversal in investment demand (Box III.1). Going forward, an increase in allocation of capital expenditure by 10.7 per cent in the Union Budget 2017-18 is expected to generate some multiplier effects, but the catalytic effects of fiscal crowding in setting off a turnaround in the investment cycle is largely contingent on revival in private investment Gross domestic investment in India has been muted in a prolonged phase that set in during the post global financial crisis (GFC) period. Capacity utilisation has remained low and industrial activity depressed in an environment characterised by subdued global and domestic demand. Consequently, when gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) posted positive growth in Q3:2016-17 after three consecutive quarters of contraction, one question has evoked considerable interest: Is the recent upturn indicating a turning point in the investment cycle and what are the implications for growth? The Markov switching model of Hamilton (1989) was applied on growth rates (annualised seasonally adjusted q-o-q) of investment [chart (a)] to check whether the recent surge in the investment growth rate is, in fact, a turning point. Markov-switching probabilities suggest that the inflexion point in the investment cycle to a higher growth regime has still not materialised. Similar exercise on GDP growth rates [chart (b)] also does not suggest any turnaround. Furthermore, output and investment growth cycles (annualised q-o-q) are also examined using Wavelet analysis which offers the possibility of decomposing the time series data into several series of orthogonal sequences of scales representing different periodicities/ frequencies. Charts (c) and (d) present the wavelet transformation of GDP and GFCF growth rates [first panel in Charts (c) and (d)] into a low frequency scale that represents the long-run trend in the growth rates [second panel in Charts (c) and (d)] and four relatively higher frequency levels [third to sixth panel in Charts (c) and (d)]. The addition of these low frequency and high Notes: 1. Using Daubechies 4 wavelet at level 4 (Smooth wavelets like the Daubechies 4 give better approximations to continuous functions).

Cross wavelet and wavelet coherence software were provided by A. Grinsted http://www.glaciology.net/wavelet-coherence.

Black thick contour represents 5 per cent significance. frequency decompositions produces the observed data. Long-term GDP and GFCF growth rates seem to have moderated in the years following the global financial crisis. The moderation in the long-term investment cycle has been much sharper than the output growth cycle. The lower frequency cycles (of periodicities 2-4 years) of output growth do not show any visible signs of a turnaround in the recent period. However, the investment cycle (of periodicity 2 years) indicates some increase [fourth panel in Chart (d)] consistent with the higher GFCF growth rates recorded in H2:2016-17. The red coloured regions inside the black thick contours of the cross wavelet coherence in Chart (e) represent the high and significant co-movement between output and investment cycles at different time points (in x-axis) and at different cycle lengths represented by period (in y-axis). This indicates that output and investment cycles strongly co-moved in the 2-4 year cycle during the pre-crisis period, but co-moved only in the 3-4 year cycle in the recent period. Therefore, the uptick in the 2-year period cycle for investment might not immediately translate into higher output growth. Yogo, M.

A binding constraint is the heightened risk aversion among banks, many laden with double-digit percentage of stressed assets to gross advances, to finance sectors that are excessively leveraged. Sector- specific slack and demand substitution through cheaper imports in some segments due to excess global capacity are other drags on the revival in investment. tobacco products. Receipts from the service tax grew by 17.1 per cent due to imposition of Krishi Kalyan cess at 0.5 per cent from June 1, 2016. Relatively robust indirect tax collections and lower spending on subsidies also entailed a wider divergence between GVA and GDP growth rates. Another key component of aggregate demand - government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) - continued to provide strong support to aggregate demand in H2:2016-17 due to the implementation of the 7th CPC award and OROP. Lower spending on all major subsidies - food, fertilisers and petroleum - contained Central Government\u2019s revenue expenditure at the budgeted level for 2016-17. Although there was a shortfall in realisation of budgeted receipts from disinvestment and spectrum auctions, buoyant indirect tax collections and non-tax revenues helped in realising the fiscal deficit target even as capital expenditure did not experience any cutbacks, unlike in previous years (Table III.2). In fact, the revised estimates (RE) of capital expenditure were 13.3 per cent higher than budgeted estimates (BE), reflecting improvement in expenditure quality. Union excise duty collections grew by 34.5 per cent on a y-o-y basis on account of the upward revision in clean environment cess, imposition of infrastructure cess on certain motor vehicles, additional excise duty on jewellery articles and increase in excise duty on The Union Budget, 2017-18 deferred the target for the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) to GDP ratio of 3.0 per cent to 2018-19 from 2017-18. Nevertheless, the government remained committed to the spirit of fiscal consolidation as the Centre\u2019s GFD is budgeted to decline by 0.3 percentage point to 3.2 per cent in 2017-18 through an increase in non-debt receipts, particularly tax revenues and disinvestment proceeds.

Growth in merchandise exports as well as imports turned positive for the first time in eight quarters; however, a stronger pick-up in imports than in exports expanded the trade deficit in Q3 and the first two months of Q4.

Future fiscal consolidation is contingent upon efficient revenue mobilisation - broadening the tax base; and incentivising digital payments. Notwithstanding the slowdown in global demand, evident in weak imports by advanced economies (AEs), India\u2019s exports to AEs resisted this slowdown and actually increased in Q2 and Q3:2016-17 alongside the pick-up in exports to emerging market economies (EMEs) which had accounted for a large part of the decline in India\u2019s exports over the last two years. In fact, export shipments to EMEs registered positive growth for the first time since Q3:2014-15. The latest available data in respect of 21 States suggest an increase in GFD to gross state domestic product (GSDP) ratio to 3.4 per cent in 2016-17 (RE) against 3.0 per cent budgeted. Net of Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) bonds, however, the ratio was lower at 3.0 per cent. For 2017-18 (BE), The GFD-GSDP ratio of 21 states works out to 2.6 per cent (Table III.3). The deterioration in State finances during 2016-17 will impact the overall fiscal position of the general government. Significantly, the turnaround in India\u2019s export growth in Q3 was led by non-oil exports with almost the entire The Centre\u2019s borrowing programme was conducted as per the planned issuance schedule within the overall contour of debt management strategy. Combined gross market borrowings of the Centre and States (dated securities) during 2016-17 increased by 9.6 per cent over the previous year (Table III.4). Increased borrowing by the state governments may exert pressure on the finite pool of investible resources and crowd out private investment. increase in oil exports accounted for by the increase in international crude oil prices. Exports of some labour- intensive sectors such as ready-made garments, gems and jewellery, and leather and products experienced transient pressures from demonetisation. All broad categories of imports, viz. oil, gold and non-oil non- gold imports, increased during October-February 2016-17 (Chart III.7). Gold imports, which rose in November after demonetisation and declined sharply in the next two months, increased in February 2017 due to domestic stockpiling ahead of festive (Akshaya Tritiya) and wedding season. Strong price effects caused by Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut pushed up the growth of oil imports in nominal terms even as import volumes declined in recent months. proposals and the change in the monetary policy stance of the Reserve Bank. FPIs in both the equity and debt segments recorded net inflow of US$ 11.6 billion in February and March 2017. FPIs have been more bullish about the continuance of the domestic reforms, especially after decisive outcomes in recent State elections. Inflows in the debt segment were largely influenced by domestic and global interest rate differentials. Higher repayments caused net outflow of external commercial borrowings during April-February of 2016-17. Net outflow of US$ 18.0 billion of non-resident deposits during October 2016 to January 2017 reflected the redemption of FCNR (B) deposits. in H2:2016-17 Net services exports moderated (October 2016 - January 2017) in relation to the corresponding period of 2015-16. Among services exports, India\u2019s software exports face uncertainty from global headwinds, especially from the likely restrictions relating to the H1-B visas. A higher flow of tourist arrivals augured well for exports of travel services. The net outgo due to investment income payments in Q3, however, was marginally lower than in the corresponding period of 2015-16. Private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas, declined by 3.8 per cent in Q3 from their level a year ago. Despite a lower merchandise trade deficit, current account deficit at 1.4 per cent of GDP in Q3 was almost at the same level as a year ago, though higher than the preceding two quarters. While net FDI inflows at US$ 13.2 billion in H2:2016- 17 (October 2016 - January 2017) moderated from the level a year ago, net portfolio flows turned positive in Q4. On a cumulative basis, net FDI inflows, however, rose to US$ 33.9 billion in April-January 2016-17 as compared with US$ 31.6 billion a year ago, suggesting India is becoming a preferred investment destination. The bout of global risk aversion that caused net (FPI) outflow of during November 2016 to January 2017 subsided subsequently as foreign portfolio investors turned net buyers in response to the Union Budget In real economic activity gets more comprehensively captured through Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices across all the sectors of the economy. Real GDP at market prices is derived by adding net indirect taxes (product taxes minus product subsidies) to real GVA at basic prices. Independently estimated private and government final consumption, gross fixed capital formation and net exports do not add up to this total, resulting in discrepancies in GDP, especially in quarterly estimates. Output growth in terms of GVA at basic prices decelerated in H2:2016-17 relative to H1 and a year ago, with the impact of demonetisation on manufacturing and services sector activity turning out to be smaller and transient relative to the underlying moderation that has been in evidence since H2:2015- 16 (Table III.5). The agriculture sector remained resilient and rebounded on the strength of a normal monsoon after two consecutive years of near drought conditions, vigorous sowing activity and effective supply management by the Government. Seasonally adjusted q-o-q annualised GVA movements also confirm the weakening of growth in H2:2016- 17vis-\u00e0-vis H1 (Chart III.8a). For H2, the October MPR had projected GVA growth of 7.7 per cent. It had noted that the actual outcome for Q1 had matched projections given in the April 2016 MPR.

The CSO\u2019s estimates for Q2: 2016-17 GVA at 6.7 per cent undershot RBI staff\u2019s April projections sizeably, suggesting greater than expected loss of momentum (Chart III.8b). The projected pace of acceleration in agriculture on the back of favourable base effects did not materialise and output from allied activities slowed more than expected. Furthermore, the anticipation of an investment-driven boost to electricity generation and mining and quarrying was belied. Construction activity also weakened more than projected on weaker demand. The sharper loss of momentum was further evident in CSO\u2019s subsequent data releases. The rise in crude oil prices, which adversely affected corporate bottom lines, also contributed. In addition, the knock-on effects of demonetisation, especially in the industrial sector and some sub-components of the services sector pulled down GVA growth out of alignment with the October MPR projections, but these effects were much more muted and transitory than the loss of momentum in Q2 on the more endemic factors large unanticipated described earlier. Moreover, data revisions relating to 2014-16 also contributed to the deviations from the October MPR projections. These developments were closely monitored and reassessments were made in the December 2016 and February 2017 MPC resolutions in which the annual GVA growth projection was pared to 7.1 and 6.9 per cent, respectively. The impact of demonetisation on the overall GVA growth was mitigated by a significantly higher growth in agriculture and public administration and defence The strong performance in foodgrains was not, however, matched by the horticulture sector. Its growth decelerated during 2016-17 as per advance estimates. Yet, livestock, barring wool production, grew at a robust pace, providing an alternate source of income to the rural population and supporting GVA from agriculture and allied activities as a whole. and other services (PADO) components of the services sector. Even after excluding government spending, the momentum of GVA growth remained broadly unchanged in Q3: 2016-17 (Chart III.9). The growth of agriculture and allied activities accelerated in H2: 2016-17 on a y-o-y basis as well as sequentially, reflecting the record foodgrains production. Furthermore, adequate soil moisture, a reasonable northeast monsoon in the initial part of the season and comfortable reservoir levels (above the 10-year average) resulted in an increase in sowing of rabi crops by 5.7 per cent over a year ago. Higher sowing, particularly in wheat, pulses and oilseeds, coupled with other factors such as timely announcement of minimum support prices (MSPs) (especially for pulses) and availability of key agricultural inputs supported agricultural activity. It is important to note that rabi sowing in all subsequent weeks after the announcement of demonetisation remained higher than a year ago - except for the week ended November 18, 2016 - suggesting that there was no impact on sowing activity per se. Value added in the industrial sector decelerated in H2:2016-17 on a y-o-y basis, led by manufacturing. Sequentially, however, activity in the sector gained momentum in the same period, buoyed mainly by the better performance of the mining and quarrying sectors. Organised industry remained largely resilient in the face of demonetisation. The deceleration in the industrial sector was discernible even before the demonetisation - the IIP contracted by 0.3 per cent in the period April-October 2016 as compared with a growth of 4.8 per cent in the same period of the previous year. This deceleration was partly on account of the negative base effect relating to insulated rubber cables, which pulled down IIP (Chart III.10). Trimmed off insulated rubber cables, IIP growth during April- October 2016 was 3.0 per cent. The subsequent waning of the negative base effect helped in propping up IIP, aided by a pick-up in momentum. The mining and quarrying segment slowed down from the beginning of 2016-17, mainly reflecting tepid coal production. Post demonetisation, the growth of The dwindling of wheat stocks below the quarterly buffer norm during August 2016 till date prompted an increase in wheat imports. Import of pulses also grew significantly during the year. The record production of wheat and pulses in 2016-17 is expected to augment stocks substantially and keep prices under check. the mining and quarrying sector, which is less cash intensive, accelerated sequentially. This was on account of improvement in coal production, although natural gas and crude oil production continued to contract. The impact of demonetisation on the manufacturing sector was transient - after contracting in December 2016, manufacturing output bounced back in January 2017. The manufacturing PMI, which had slipped in the contractionary zone in December 2016, expanded in January-March 2017. The performance of listed private companies remained resilient as sales and net profit growth improved at the aggregate level, although the performance of non-information technology (non- IT) service sector companies continued to be lacklustre (Chart III.11). Sales in cash intensive sectors such as fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and motor vehicles declined in Q3 vis-\u00e0-vis the previous quarter (Chart III.12a and b). However, lead indicators such as passenger car sales and consumer durables suggest that this impact was short-lived. implementation of the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme, the outlook for electricity generation has brightened considerably. The electricity sector recorded a sharp increase in H2:2016-17 on a y-o-y basis. Although thermal electricity remained weak, non- conventional sources such as solar and wind energy have registered higher production while pulling down the price. With India taking significant strides in expanding non-conventional sources of energy, helped by an enabling policy environment, and with the expected improvement in the financial health of power distribution companies (DISCOMs) after The slowdown in the services sector, which became evident from Q1:2016-17, was sharper in H2:2016- 17. Some services sectors were adversely impacted by demonetisation, albeit temporarily, especially construction and realty. The implicit CSO data for Q4, however, suggests that these effects to be waning. Steel consumption and cement production - lead indicators of construction activity - remained positive from Q2:2016-17, although there was a sharp decline in cement production since December (Chart III.13). view of growing protectionist and anti-globalisation sentiments in the US. As alluded to earlier, public administration and defence continued to exhibit robust growth throughout 2016-17 due to higher expenditure on account of the 7th CPC award and OROP. Given the commitment to fiscal consolidation, however, double digit growth in these segments may not sustain in 2017-18. Overall, for the services sector, lead/coincident indicators suggest some recovery in Q4 from a prolonged downturn and the more immediate hit from demonetisation. The government\u2019s continuing thrust on building infrastructure - as evident from a significant increase in both road projects awarded and constructed - and rural housing, should revive the construction sector in the period ahead. Trade, hotels, transport and communication are the other sectors, which are shrugging off the effects of demonetisation and gearing up for a revival. Tourist arrivals have picked up strongly in recent months. In the transport segment, major lead indicators such as commercial and passenger vehicles sales have revived from the lows of November/December 2016. The efficacy of monetary policy critically depends on an accurate assessment of resource utilisation. In this context, a good fix on potential output is vital but challenging since it is unobservable. Estimation of potential output has to deal with uncertainty as real time measures of aggregate activity contain a considerable amount of noise and are often subject to significant revisions. The introduction of a new base year for national accounts (2011-12) and the continuing unavailability of a time series for previous years for ensuring appropriate degrees of freedom in econometric estimation are major impediments in this endeavour. Demonetisation added some uncertainty to the growth outlook, but its impact was transitory. Financial, real estate and business services have faced subdued conditions for the past four quarters as constraints on account of slowing bank credit pulled down its growth. Credit growth has continued to remain tepid, although insurance premiums witnessed a surge. The real estate segment, which largely reflects value addition by listed real estate companies, was impacted by demonetisation as evident in a sharp fall in the BSE realty index. Subsequently, these losses have been recouped as these transitory effects wore off. For a fair assessment of the output gap for India, which indicates deviation of actual output from its potential level and expressed as percentage of potential output, the revised GVA data were augmented with forecasts applying different univariate filters such as the Hodrick-Prescott filter, the Baxter-King filter, the Christiano-Fitzgerald filter and a Multivariate Kalman (MKV) filter4. A MKV filter is particularly useful as it juxtaposes demand conditions with movements 4 Hodrick, R. J., & Prescott, E. C. (1997). \u201cPostwar US Business Cycles: An Empirical Investigation\u201d . Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, pp.1-16. The business services segment largely reflects the performance of IT companies. Sales and profit of these companies remained robust. Nonetheless, the outlook for this segment is clouded by uncertainty in Baxter, M., & King, R. G. (1999).\u201d Measuring Business Cycles: Approximate Band-Pass Filters for Economic Time Series\u201d.

The estimated output gap measures were aggregated by using principal components to get a composite measure, which indicates that the output gap (actual minus potential), is gradually closing (Chart III.14). Growth prospects are expected to strengthen in 2017- 18 on account of several factors. First, discretionary consumer demand held down by demonetisation is expected to bounce back. Second, economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transportation as well as in the unorganised sector is getting rapidly restored. Third, demonetisation-induced ease funding conditions has led to a sharp improvement in transmission of past policy rate reductions into marginal cost-based lending rates, and in turn, to lending rates for healthy borrowers, which should spur a pick-up in both consumption and investment demand. Fourth, the emphasis in the Union Budget for 2017-18 on the rural economy and affordable housing should also be positive for growth. Domestic market segments were shaped by local factors in an environment of heightened volatility in global financial markets. Large surplus liquidity in the money market post-demonetisation was managed with a mix of conventional and unconventional instruments. Volatility in the foreign exchange market remained contained, notwithstanding portfolio outflows. Credit growth, particularly to industry, remained depressed on asset quality concerns and weak investment demand. Equity and debt markets exhibited episodic price movements before stabilising by the end of the year. Since the October 2016 Monetary Policy Report (MPR), the appetite for risk in global financial markets has been punctuated by bouts of volatility triggered by the largely unanticipated US presidential election results in November, apprehensions of intensified protectionist measures by the US, and monetary policy tightening with unexpected hawkish guidance by the Fed in December. Thereafter, markets responded positively to the expectations of a significant reset of the policy mix in the US by the new administration sharpening focus on the fiscal policy. The strengthening of the US dollar, hardening of bond yields, a surge in equity markets on easing global deflation risks and a stronger growth outlook for advanced economies (AEs) triggered capital outflows from emerging market economies (EMEs). Consequently, fixed income markets and exchange rates in EMEs came under pressure. Volatility in markets of most EMEs, however, remained contained, unlike during the taper tantrum. More recently, EMEs have witnessed a resumption of portfolio flows. Domestic financial markets were impacted by twin shocks \u2013 demonetisation and the US presidential election results. The Union Budget announcements, the shift in the monetary policy stance of the Reserve Bank and new data releases relating to inflation and economic activity also influenced market movements. Demonetisation drove a wall of liquidity into the money market. War-time liquidity management by the Reserve Bank, however, limited the extent of softening of money market rates relative to the policy repo rate within the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor. G-sec yields moved in either direction, driven by different factors. While the announcement of a policy rate cut in October and demonetisation imparted a softening bias, tightening of monetary policy in the US, application of the incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR) to absorb surplus liquidity, the status quo on monetary policy by the Reserve Bank in December and the shift in the monetary policy stance in February 2017 to neutral hardened yields. The rupee displayed two-way movements up to mid-January, but since then, it has appreciated on resumption of portfolio inflows in both the debt and equity segments. Surplus liquidity conditions impelled and lubricated the transmission of monetary impulses to deposit and lending rates. However, credit growth, particularly to industry, remained sluggish on risk aversion by banks due to high levels of stressed assets and weak demand in view of the depressed investment cycle and the presence of spare capacity in manufacturing. IV.1.1 Money Market: In Q3 of 2016-17, the October policy repo rate cut was transmitted fully in the money market, amidst easy liquidity conditions. The unprecedented surge of liquidity after the announcement of demonetisation (details set out in Section IV.3) shocked the market. The efficacy of liquidity absorption operations by the Reserve Bank can be gauged from the fact that the weighted average call money rate (WACR) \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 traded at only about 14 bps below the repo rate between November 9, 2016 and end- December 2016; it coursed 6 bps below during October 2016 to November 8, 2016. In Q4, the stepped-up pace of remonetisation resulted in some reduction in the liquidity surplus, which was still massive relative to the historical experience. A calibrated change in the mix of instruments for liquidity absorption from open market operations (OMOs) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) to reverse repo operations under the Reserve Bank\u2019s LAF imparted a further softening bias to the WACR, to the policy repo rate, which has spilled over to even 3-month money market rates, as discussed subsequently. The 3-month treasury bill (T-bill) rate has often stayed closer to the fixed reverse repo rate \u2013 or the floor of the LAF corridor \u2013 rather than the policy repo rate. Narrowing of the LAF corridor under such conditions can help in finer alignment of the operating target to the repo rate. This, in turn, could make overall money market conditions more consistent with the monetary policy stance. which traded at 25 bps below the repo rate, on average. The usual year-end liquidity pressure stemming from banks\u2019 balance sheet adjustments and tax payments to the Government did not spike money market rates, as the post-demonetisation liquidity overhang remained substantial. Other overnight money market rates, viz., collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (CBLO) and market repo, also traded in sync with the WACR, albeit with a downside bias of about 35 bps (Chart IV.1). Country practices on the width of the policy corridor point to a considerable diversity, suggesting that the choice of the width of the corridor is time- and country- specific (Table IV 1). In the Indian context, the recent overhang of large surplus liquidity \u2013 despite full absorption through the use of both conventional and unconventional instruments \u2013 has imparted a persistent downside bias to money market rates relative Demonetisation-induced surplus liquidity conditions also impacted the market micro structure, which had a bearing on volumes and rates. In the call money market, lending volumes of co-operative banks increased significantly. Their share in average daily call volumes rose to more than 50 per cent post- demonetisation (up to February 2017), from the average of 36 per cent during April-October 2016. These reported trades, as opposed to the transaction-based Negotiated Dealing System-Call (NDS-CALL) rates, pulled down the overall WACR, especially during later hours of the trading days. In the collateralised segments, mutual funds increased their lending in both the CBLO and market repo segments, enabled by large mobilisation of short-term funds, and consequently, collateralised rates traded below the WACR. Banks were active on the borrowing side in both the CBLO and market repo segments (accounting for about 74 per cent and 79 per cent of total daily average volumes, respectively, in February 2017), taking advantage of their lower cost of funds. Although many banks arbitraged between the various segments of the money market and the Reserve Bank\u2019s LAF window, persistently high structural surplus liquidity heavily weighed on money market rates. Nonetheless, volatility in the WACR estimated from an IGARCH1 (1,1) model has been muted (Chart IV.2). In view of surplus liquidity, banks reduced recourse to certificates of deposit (CDs), issuance of which declined sharply to `407 billion and `850 billon during Q3 and Q4 (up to March 17, 2017) of 2016-17 as against `1,446 1 To model time varying conditional volatility recognising persistence of shocks to volatility, an Integrated Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (IGARCH) model is used which is a restricted version of the GARCH model, where the persistence parameters sum up to one. billion and `2,607 billion, respectively, during Q3 and Q4 of previous year (Chart IV.3). Liquidity also imparted a softening bias to the weighted average discount rates in primary issuance markets for commercial paper (CP). In the secondary markets, 3-month CD and 91-day T-bill rates softened by about 25 and 63 bps, respectively, while the 3-month CP rate declined by 30 bps. yield curve shifted downwards. Later during the month, however, yields moved up marginally tracking rising global yields on expectations of a Fed rate hike in December 2016. Second, G-sec yields softened significantly after the announcement of demonetisation and the resultant surge of liquidity in the system (Chart IV.5). The yield on the benchmark 10-year paper dropped from 6.80 per cent on November 8, 2016 to 6.19 per cent on November 24, 2016 (touching an intra-day low of 6.11 per cent on November 25, 2016, i.e., below the policy repo rate). Yields aligned with the policy rate in the first week of IV.1.2 Government Securities Market: Yields in the government securities (G-sec) market remained volatile in H2, induced by three major events (Chart IV.4). First, G-sec yields softened in October 2016 following the 25 bps policy repo rate cut by the Reserve Bank and the December 2016. Trading volumes in the secondary market reached an all-time high of `2,051 billion on November 21, 2016. In the primary market, 91-day T-bill yields plummeted to 5.86 per cent on November 23, 2016. market (Chart IV.6). From October 2016 to January 2017, there were net FPI outflows of around `336 billion from the Indian G-sec market. Since February, however, there have been net FPI inflows of about `229 billion. Yields hardened in December 2016 due to a number of factors: imposition of incremental CRR to absorb surplus liquidity in the banking system; portfolio outflows from the debt market following the hike in interest rate by the US Fed accompanied by the hawkish statement about future rate hikes; expectations of fiscal stimulus in the US (which pushed up US bond yields); rising crude oil prices; and the status quo on monetary policy announced by the Reserve Bank. Third, G-sec yields hardened in February 2017 and the yield curve steepened in response to the unexpected shift in the monetary policy stance of the Reserve Bank from accommodative to neutral, higher CPI inflation excluding food and fuel, and bunching of Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) bonds with State Development Loans (SDLs) issuances, as discussed subsequently. The generic 10-year yield rose on the date of announcement of the change in the monetary policy stance in February by 31 bps to 6.93 per cent. The average daily closing of generic 10-year yield increased from 6.96 per cent in February 2017 to 7.13 per cent in March 2017. Higher domestic yields since February, inter alia, have contributed to the return of portfolio flows to the debt Fiscal developments had a bearing on G-sec yields during Q4. The Central Government reduced its market borrowings in Q4 of 2016-17 by `180 billion through dated securities and `510 billion through T-bills, which reduced the supply of sovereign paper in the market. The Government announced net market borrowings for 2017-18 in the Union Budget at `4,232 billion (BE), which included planned buyback of securities of `750 billion. The Union Budget has also provided for `250 billion for switching of securities, which is a debt management strategy that aims at reducing near-term redemption pressure and elongating the maturity of debt. State Governments\u2019 reliance on market borrowings for funding their fiscal deficit has increased steadily in recent years. Large issuances of SDLs by States have been exerting upward pressure on yields (Chart IV.7). The spread of SDLs cut-off over the 10-year G-sec increased persistently in the second half of 2016-17 \u2013 from 28-49 bps in October 2016 to 86-114 bps in March 2017. As regards UDAY bonds, issuances during the previous year were at a fixed spread of 75 bps over the corresponding/10-year FIMMDA G-sec yields. The spreads for issuances of UDAY bonds during 2016-17, however, came down to the range of 35-75 bps, following the modification in the issuance strategy to invite bids from all the market participants. IV.1.3 Corporate Bond Market: The corporate bond yield (AAA 5-year benchmark) softened from 7.52 per cent in October 2016 to 7.33 per cent in January 2017, tracking the movements in G-sec yields on surplus liquidity conditions after demonetisation. However, after the February monetary policy announcement, the corporate bond yield hardened to 7.65 per cent before declining to 7.56 per cent at end-March 2017. Taking advantage of low yields and tight credit market conditions because of stressed assets in the banking system, corporates mobilised higher resources from the corporate bond market, i.e., `2,502 billion during October 2016 \u2013 February 2017 as against `1,957 billion during the corresponding period of the previous year (Chart IV.8). Private placements constituted 97.8 per cent of the total amount mobilised. Indian corporates also raised large resources by way of bonds from international markets (Chart IV.9). (i) enhancing the aggregate limit of partial credit enhancement (PCE) provided by banks to 50 per cent; (ii) permitting brokers in corporate bond repos; and (iii) allowing consolidation and re-issuance of corporate Foreign portfolio investment in the corporate bond market declined during November 2016 to January 2017 on account of risk-off strategies followed by international investors. Portfolio flows turned positive from February due to global risk-on portfolio shifts and also to take advantage of higher domestic yields. Several measures were announced to deepen the corporate bond market: terms of amount) increased by 63.8 per cent during H2, which was a record high. In US dollar terms, the turnover increased from US$ 6.0 billion in H2:2015-16 to US$ 9.7 billion in H2: 2016-17. gained by 6.3 per cent in H2:2016-17 (Chart IV.10). In October 2016, the stock market remained volatile due to factors such as increasing prospects of an interest rate hike by the US Fed in December and consequent portfolio outflows, and mixed corporate results for Q2. Following the 25 bps cut in the repo rate by the Reserve Bank in October 2016, it gained modestly. During November 2016, the BSE Sensex plunged by 4.6 per cent on uncertainty over the impact of demonetisation on economic growth and corporate earnings and also portfolio equity outflows triggered by the risk-off market reactions to the US presidential election results. Demonetisation had a relatively greater impact on cash sensitive sectors such as FMCG, consumer durables, auto and realty vis-a-vis the overall Sensex. The downward bias persisted during December on sustained selling by foreign institutional investors, subdued auto sales data for November, persisting concerns about Q3 earnings, and the interest rate increase by the US Fed but with unexpected hawkish guidance. The stock market revived in January 2017 due to value buying by domestic institutional investors, better than expected quarterly corporate results for Q3, revival of foreign portfolio equity investment from mid-January and positive cues from global markets. The recovery continued in February 2017 on proposals made in the Union Budget, particularly a lower fiscal deficit target for 2017-18, exemption of category I and category II foreign portfolio investors from taxation on indirect transfers, and an unchanged capital gains tax rate for the capital market. FPIs stepped up buying following the status quo maintained by the US Fed and positive cues from global equity markets. The impact of demonetisation on sectoral indices was transitory as they have recovered their losses and scaled higher than their pre-demonetisation levels. in March, which was already priced in by markets, the dovish stance improved appetite for risk assets, including in EMEs. On expectations that the State election results would provide the impetus for reforms, the BSE Sensex (29,974) and Nifty (9,265) closed at all time highs on April 5, 2017. IV.1.5 Foreign Exchange Market: In the foreign exchange market, the rupee moved in a narrow range against the US dollar and appreciated against the euro and pound sterling in H2 of 2016-17 (Chart IV.11). In Q3, the weakness of the rupee against the US dollar mainly reflected the strengthening of the dollar following the US presidential election outcome; FPI outflows (both in equity and debt); increased demand from oil importers for foreign currency; FCNR(B) redemption pressures; and the policy rate cut in October 2016. The US dollar strengthened in anticipation of an expansionary fiscal policy and tighter monetary policy by the Fed. Consequently, the rupee depreciated against the US dollar by 2.9 per cent (from `66.71 per US dollar on November 8 to `68.72 on November 28). The rupee regained about half of the lost ground by the first week of December 2016, but came under renewed downward pressure till end-January 2017 in response to the Fed policy rate hike. From February 2017 onwards, the rupee has appreciated due to equity portfolio inflows on policy announcements made in the Union Budget and easing of concerns about In March, the stock market gained further on better than expected Q3 GDP growth estimates in India released by the CSO, PMI for both manufacturing and services for the month of February pointing to expansion after the demonetisation-induced contraction, and approval of the draft Central GST (CGST) and Integrated GST (IGST) bills by the GST Council.2 Despite the Fed rate increase 2 This marked a crucial step in the run up to the planned introduction of GST by July 1, 2017, which will replace the existing numerous central and state taxes. Appreciation (+) / Depreciation (-) (per cent) the speed of Fed policy rate hikes. Factors such as India\u2019s low current account deficit, the emphasis of monetary policy on the 4 per cent inflation target, the transient impact of demonetisation on economic activity, and the commitment to fiscal prudence announced in the Union Budget provided stability to the exchange rate. The rupee gained further in March as FPI inflows, especially equity, were boosted by the outcome of State elections, which augur well for accelerating the pace of reforms. In terms of both 36-currency nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and real effective exchange rate (REER), the rupee appreciated by 6.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively, between end-March 2017 and end-March 2016 (Table IV.2). per cent by March 17, 2017. Several factors, however, overstate this slowdown. As outlined in the October 2016 MPR, credit flows were impacted by loan write-offs and swapping of bank credit into special securities under the UDAY (Chart IV.12). In addition, the use of specified bank notes (SBNs) for repaying loans would have also dampened the growth rate of bank credit. From the demand side, a depressed investment cycle, persisting excess capacity in manufacturing, and deleveraging on the part of corporates to improve their credit ratings (as explained in Chapter III) have contributed to the slowdown in credit growth. IV.1.6 Credit Market: In the credit market, y-o-y growth in non-food credit decelerated through H2 to a low of 4.7 per cent in early January before picking up to 5.1 The deceleration in credit growth also highlights the role of supply side factors \u2013 stressed assets and capital constraint \u2013 in hindering a revival in the credit cycle (Box IV.1 and Chart IV.13). The \u201ccapital crunch hypothesis\u201d, i.e., capital constrained banks cutting back on lending, was highlighted as a key factor that worsened the US recession in the early 1990s (Bernanke and Lown, 1991). Since then, theoretical and empirical literature has firmly established the role of a \u201ccapital channel\u201d that operates from the supply side of credit, as opposed to the typical focus of monetary policy transmission on the demand side (Rivera, 2015). Two arguments are highlighted in the debate on the role of bank capital in conditioning the credit cycle. First is the endogenous money view, which indicates that banks can always fully meet the demand for loans from all credit-worthy borrowers, and no funding constraint (posed by the composition of liabilities in terms of equity versus debt) can prevent banks from doing so. This macro view is in sync with the Modigliani and Miller argument on the irrelevance of capital structure as applied to banks, i.e., the composition of liabilities of banks should not influence the price and quantity of credit. Second, the post-Keynesian emphasis on credit rationing under which borrowers, that cannot meet tighter credit standards set by banks (say, amidst a recession or heightened uncertainty that may change the risk assessment of banks), fail to access credit. Thus, not all demand for credit is met. When banks face a loss of confidence (arising, for example from unanticipated large increase in stressed assets), they need more capital to bolster their loss absorbing capacity. Raising capital from equity holders, however, becomes difficult, costlier and unattractive in such a situation, forcing banks to deleverage instead. This may also reflect the natural eventual outcome of the lack of market and regulatory discipline and the tendency to evergreen bad loans. An adverse feedback loop sets in, under which inadequate capital leads to cut backs on lending to viable projects. In turn, this deepens a recession, which increases stressed assets and reduces capital further. (CRAR) significantly influence credit growth. While better capitalised banks exhibit higher credit growth, banks with higher GNPAs experience weaker credit growth (Table 1). Low net interest margin (NIM) is an indicator of efficient intermediation. However, when faced with large stressed assets, banks may either (i) strive to maintain/increase their NIMs and/or (ii) reduce supply of credit. Panel data (quarterly data of 72 banks for the period Q2 of 2010 to Q4 of 2016) regression results suggest that credit risk proxied by the stressed assets (i.e., restructured assets plus gross NPAs) to total assets ratio has a positive and statistically significant relationship with NIM of banks as a percentage of their total assets (Table 2). Regression results also indicate that one (positive) standard deviation shock to stressed assets could lead to about 0.15 standard deviation increase in NIM. Using panel data for the Indian banking system (quarterly data of 66 banks for the period Q1 of 2009 to Q4 of 2016) and applying four different models (i.e., fixed effects, random effects, difference and system generalised method of moments (GMM) following Arellano-Bond/Bond-Bover) to check for the robustness of estimates, it is found that the gross non-performing assets (GNPA) and capital to risk weighted assets ratio Notes: NIM = (Interest income minus interest expense) to total assets (in per cent). Stressed assets = (Restructured assets plus gross NPAs) to total assets (in per cent).

Hansen test for over identification restrictions and Arellano-Bond test for residual auto correlations are found to be satisfactory. *:Significant at 1% level. It is observed that banks could protect their NIM up to Q3:2014-15. Thereafter, however, their NIM declined, which also coincided with the sustained deceleration in credit growth. After the Asset Quality Review initiated in April 2015, decline in income associated with the explicit recognition of NPAs lowered the NIM. This amplified risk aversion and led to further deceleration of credit growth.

However, the overall flow of financial resources to the commercial sector in 2016-17 (up to mid-March) was lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year due to lower lending from banks. Among non-bank sources, funding from foreign sources increased due to marginally higher FDI inflows and a sharp increase in short-term credit. Financing through domestic sources increased primarily due to higher funding from NBFCs, subscription to commercial paper by non-banks and private placement by non-financial entities, notwithstanding diminished public issues (Table IV.3). Sectoral data on flow of credit indicate that deceleration in credit, though broad-based, was characterised by a There was decline in credit in 12 of the 18 major While the availability of funding from banks remained weak, the flow of credit from NBFCs3 during the first three quarters of 2016-17 was about 50 per cent higher Monetary policy transmission strengthened in H2 of 2016-17, aided by the surfeit of liquidity. The share of low cost current account and savings account (CASA) deposits in aggregate deposits with the SCBs went up to 39.2 per cent (as on March 17, 2017) \u2013 an increase of 4.0 percentage points relative to the pre- demonetisation period. Given the prevailing risk aversion, banks reduced their term deposit rates. The median term deposit rate and the weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) fell by 37 bps and 32 bps, respectively, during November 2016-March 2017.4 Combined with the sharp increase in CASA deposits, the overall cost of borrowings declined, 3 Data pertain to loans and advances extended by about 400 NBFCs (NBFCs-D and NBFCs-ND-SI that submit quarterly returns to RBI) and adjusted for their borrowings from banks, financial institutions and through CPs. 4 WADTDR pertains to November 2016 to February 2017. 1 2 Gross private placements by non-financial entities @ 3 Net issuance of CPs subscribed to by non-banks 4 Net Credit by housing finance companies # 5 Total accommodation by the 4 RBI regulated All India Financial Institutions @ 6 NBFCs-D and NBFCs-ND-SI (net of borrowings from banks/FIs/CPs) # 7 Public issues by non-financial entities @ 1 External Commercial Borrowings / FCCB @ 2 ADR/GDR Issues excluding banks and financial institutions @ 3 4 Note: Data are provisional. #: Up to December. *:Up to January. @: Up to February.

The one-year median MCLR declined by a cumulative 70 bps since November 2016, even as the policy rate remained unchanged. This is significant, given that the decline during the preceding seven months (April-October 2016) \u2013 when the repo rate was cut by 50 bps \u2013 was only 15 bps (Chart IV.16). Post-demonetisation (up to March 2017), 27 public sector banks have reduced their one-year median MCLR in the range of 50 to 105 bps, and 19 private sector banks have done so in the range of 25 to 148 bps. In comparison with deposit rates and the MCLR, transmission to actual lending rates has been less complete during the post-demonetisation period. During November 2016 \u2013 February 2017, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) of banks in respect of fresh rupee loans declined by 69 bps, whereas the WALR on outstanding rupee loans declined by 13 bps only over the same period. Transmission to lending rates for outstanding rupee loans vis-\u00e0-vis fresh rupee loans has been limited essentially on account of two factors. First, a major portion of loans contracted prior to the introduction of MCLR (i.e., April, 2016) has continued to be priced at the base rate5; in fact, loans contracted at the base rate still constitute about 67 per cent of banks\u2019 loan portfolios. Second, even under the MCLR- based pricing of credit, the interest rate is typically reset on the existing loans on an annual basis, implying that most loans under the MCLR regime contracted up to 5 Individual borrowers can, however, migrate to MCLR based pricing of loans from erstwhile BPLR/base rate based pricing on mutually acceptable terms. December 2016 would not have benefited from the sharp reduction in the MCLR. An analysis of factors hindering transmission using quarterly bank level data (for the first three quarters of 2016-17) suggested the presence of a positive correlation between the spread (i.e., WALR on outstanding/fresh rupee loans over MCLR) and stressed assets of banks, implying that banks charge additional risk premiums on their performing assets to compensate for the interest income losses from NPAs. Among the various components of the MCLR, it is only the term deposit rates that are seen to respond to the changes in policy rate. Another factor which has impeded monetary policy transmission is the interest rates on small savings which are not in alignment with movements in market interest rates. Although the government has announced to revise the interest rates on small savings in line with the change in G-sec yields, this is not fully implemented (Box IV.2). The amended RBI Act 1934 requires the Reserve Bank to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time, if any, in the public domain. This operating procedure \u2013 embodied in the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity management framework \u2013 was published in Box IV.I of the April 2015 MPR. The operating procedure is guided by the objective of aligning the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 the weighted average call money rate (WACR) \u2013 to the repo Although G-sec yields (10-year maturity) declined through 2016-17 (by about 79 bps), small savings rates remained unchanged for Q2 and Q4:2016-17, and were reduced only by 10 bps each for Q3:2016- 17 and Q1:2017-18. At the time of the introduction of the formula based reset of rates linked to G-sec yields for Q1:2016-17, interest rates on small savings were broadly aligned to the interest rates derived from the formula for fixing the interest rate on small savings. This spread between the actual rate of interest and the formula based interest rate increased to a range of 61 to 95 bps in Q1:2017-18 for different savings instruments (Table). The wide spread between small savings rates and bond yields makes small savings more attractive vis-\u00e0-vis bank deposits and discourages banks to fully adjust their deposit interest rates on fear of losing deposits, thereby hampering monetary transmission. Formula** based GoI announced point)** of corresponding rate through active liquidity management, consistent with the stance of monetary policy. The framework was modified in April 2016, details of which were presented in the October 2016 MPR. Consistent with the assurance given on proactive management of both permanent and frictional liquidity under the modified liquidity management framework of April 2016, and the guidance of moving the system from an average deficit equivalent to one per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) to a position of neutrality, the Reserve Bank injected permanent liquidity to the tune of `1.9 trillion during April-October 2016, primarily through open market purchase auctions of `1.1 trillion. The balance reflected the liquidity impact of forex market operations of the Reserve Bank and repurchase of securities by the Government. Following the announcement of demonetisation on November 8, 2016 and the subsequent surge in bank deposits, the Reserve Bank expanded the range of instruments for absorbing a record level of surplus liquidity. At the beginning of Q3, injection of permanent liquidity consistent with the assurance given under the modifications to liquidity management framework in April 2016, had already moved the system to an average surplus of `293 billion in Q2. As cash balances of the government increased and festival related currency demand drained liquidity out of the banking system, the average system wide surplus declined to `63 billion in October. After demonetisation, currency in circulation declined by `8,997 billion (up to January 6, 2017). The ICRR was in place for one fortnight (ended on December 9, 2016). It helped in draining excess liquidity from the system to the extent of about `4,000 billion. With the enhancement of the limit on issuance of securities under the MSS from `300 billion to `6,000 billion on December 2, 2016 by the Central Government, the Reserve Bank withdrew the ICRR. Thereafter, it managed surplus liquidity conditions through the use of fine tuning reverse repos and the MSS. In Q4, remonetisation progressed at an accelerated pace, with currency in circulation increasing cumulatively by about `4,373 billion (Chart IV.18). This reduced the liquidity surplus in the system to `3,141 billion by end-March 2017. This sudden increase in liquidity in the banking system, coupled with the weak demand for credit (as explained in Section IV.1), necessitated a significant step up in the liquidity absorption operations by the Reserve Bank so that money market rates remained consistent with the policy repo rate. The Reserve Bank used a mix of both conventional and unconventional instruments, viz., (i) temporary application of an ICRR of 100 per cent on the increase in NDTL of banks between September 16 and November 11, 2016; (ii) open market sales of cash management bills (CMBs) issued under the MSS to manage the large surplus liquidity; and (iii) variable rate reverse repos of various tenors (Chart IV.17). The peak level of liquidity absorbed reached `7,956 billion on January 4, 2017 (`2,568 billion absorbed through reverse repos and `5,466 billion through CMBs under the MSS). In anticipation of the liquidity surplus declining further due to remonetisation, the Reserve Bank increasingly resorted to reverse repo operations to absorb the surplus liquidity released by maturing CMBs, especially from January 14, 2017. The Reserve Bank absorbed daily average surplus liquidity of `4,024 billion in Q3 (after demonetisation) and `5,932 billion in Q4. This ensured the alignment of the WACR with the policy repo rate, albeit with a soft bias. (SLR) position of banks was about 11 per cent on an average in Q4 of 2016-17 (up to February), which included investment in CMBs under the MSS and excess liquidity parked with the Reserve Bank under reverse repo operations (Chart IV.20). Looking ahead, liquidity conditions are expected to remain in surplus in the short-run, which the Reserve Bank would continue to modulate so that money market rates remain consistent with the operating target and the stance of monetary policy. Progressively greater use of term reverse repos to absorb the surplus liquidity should contribute to the development of the term money market. The change in the monetary policy stance from accommodative to neutral in February 2017 has altered market expectations, but the transmission of past cumulative 175 bps cut in the repo rate to lending rates remains incomplete. Resolution of stressed assets and recapitalisation of public sector banks will be critical to ease risk aversion by banks. This will enhance the flow of credit to productive sectors and also improve monetary policy transmission. Post-demonetisation, currency in circulation contracted as SBNs were returned by the public and correspondingly, deposits with banks increased sharply (Chart IV.19). Although a sharp moderation in the currency deposit ratio led to an increase in the money multiplier, it could not offset the impact of the contraction in base money (by about 22 per cent as on March 17, 2017 from the period immediately prior to demonetisation) on broad money (M3). Structural surplus liquidity enabled banks to meet the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement, which was tightened from 70 per cent to 80 per cent in January 2017. The excess statutory liquidity ratio Global economic activity and trade picked up modestly from the later part of 2016. The firming up of commodity prices led to some uptick in inflation in major advanced economies (AEs). Recessionary conditions ebbed in key commodity exporting emerging market economies (EMEs), setting the stage for a turnaround in EMEs as a group. Since the MPR of October 2016, global growth picked up modestly towards end-2016, and is projected to improve further in 2017 by multilateral agencies. Growth in EMEs moderated in 2016, but is set to improve with the ebbing of recessionary conditions in key commodity exporting countries. Even though world trade appeared to have emerged out of a trough, new risks have emerged from an increasing tendency towards protectionist policies and heightened political tensions. Commodity prices have risen since late 2016 on improvement in US economic indicators such as strong labour market and consumer spending; infrastructure spending in China; and geopolitical concerns. Crude oil prices firmed after the OPEC announced curtailment of production. Inflation edged up on expectations of reflationary fiscal policies in the US, rising energy prices and a mild strengthening of demand. a large slippage in net exports, even though retail sales, consumer confidence and the purchasing manufacturers\u2019 index (PMI) suggested sustained momentum. Domestic demand grew (q-o-q) at the fastest pace in almost two years. Consumer confidence reached a 16-year high in March, though retail sales had slowed down in February. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (ISM) index suggested manufacturing expanded at its fastest pace in three years in February. In the Euro area, GDP growth accelerated in H2:2016. Relatively low oil prices and sustained employment gains have provided support to household incomes. Improving consumer confidence and the PMI, which rose to a six-year high in March, indicate that activity continued to expand in Q1:2017. Nonetheless, the region remains vulnerable to a number of headwinds such as the formal beginning of the Brexit process, upcoming elections in several constituent countries and tightening of financial conditions. International financial markets were impacted by the US election results and expectations of monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve, underpinned by hawkish forward guidance. Financial markets in EMEs briefly turned volatile after the US election due to large capital outflows leading to plunges in currency and equity markets. Nevertheless, average volatility remained contained by historical standards since Q4:2016. Bond yields hardened across the globe in tandem with US yields, before softening somewhat since mid-March. Strengthening of the US economy further buoyed the equity markets, while the increasing likelihood of more rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2017 hardened bond yields in AEs. The US dollar appreciated to a multi-year high in December and remained bullish. The Japanese economy continued to recover at a modest pace even as the momentum weakened in H2:2016. Increases in private consumption and fixed investment were moderate, although there was some uptick in exports and industrial production towards end-2016. The manufacturing PMI improved during January and February but moderated again in March 2017. In the UK, economic growth gained momentum in H2: 2016, notwithstanding the uncertainties surrounding the negotiations relating to Brexit, as exports rose substantially following the weakening of the pound. However, manufacturing growth weakened for two consecutive months in February, indicating the possibility of a slowdown in 2017 (Table V.1). The US economy bounced back strongly in Q3:2016, underpinned by robust consumer spending and continuing improvement in the labour market. GDP growth decelerated sharply in Q4:2016 due to Economic activity in EMEs continued to be divergent. In China, even though y-o-y GDP growth improved in Q4:2016, supported by policy stimulus and the rising property market, q-o-q growth showed a sharp loss of momentum. Industrial production and PMI has eased in Russia, with the improvement in the mining and manufacturing sectors, rise in oil prices and policy initiatives that included a more flexible exchange rate and bank recapitalisation. In South Korea, Thailand and Mexico, GDP growth lost some momentum in Q3 and Q4:2016. According to the IMF, growth in both AEs and EMEs will pick up in 2017. The OECD\u2019s composite leading indicators (CLIs) point to growth accelerating in the US, Japan, China, Brazil and Russia, stable momentum in the Euro area and tentative signs of emerging momentum in the UK. However, manufacturing activity remains weak in some countries as underscored by the PMIs (Chart V.1). World trade growth improved in Q4:2016, largely supported by EMEs as imports by AEs moderated. In January 2017, exports rebounded sharply in China and Brazil. Exports also increased in some East Asian economies. Merchandise and services trade improved (in nominal terms), although it remained below its long-term average (Chart V.2). E : Estimate, P : Projection, *: y-o-y growth. Sources: Bloomberg and IMF. stabilised, but there are rising concerns about high indebtedness and financial stability. Consequently, the growth target for 2017 has been reduced to about 6.5 per cent by the government. In Brazil, the economic situation seems to have improved with the rise in commodity prices and several measures such as reforming the bankruptcy law announced by the authorities to revive growth. Economic contraction The IMF and the World Bank project higher growth in world trade volumes in 2017. The World Trade Outlook Indicator of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the global PMI for new export orders also indicate strengthening of world trade growth momentum in Q1:2017. There are, however, several downside risks emanating from heightened policy uncertainty in the US and the UK from proposals to retreat from multilateral/regional trade agreements, raising of tariffs and non-tariff barriers and consequent retaliation. Furthermore, the medium-term trade outlook is expected to remain weak and is unlikely to revert to its pre-crisis level as several structural factors have led to a decline in the income elasticity of world trade. The recovery in world trade could, however, diverge significantly across various regional blocs (Box V.1). Since the second half of 2011, global trade growth has remained slower than the expansion in world GDP, while in the 25 years before the global financial crisis, trade growth was twice the GDP growth. Thus, the income elasticity of trade has fallen sharply in the post-crisis years. Two main developments with roughly equivalent contributions, viz., compositional effects and structural factors, have been the driving forces in the slowdown in trade vis-\u00e0-vis economic growth. Compositional effects include shift in economic activity and trade from AEs towards EMEs, the declining share of the import-intensive component of global demand and shift in trade from manufacturing to services. These factors may not necessarily be structural and could revert in the medium-term when the global economy recovers fully. Structural factors, which set in well before the global recession, reflect fundamental shifts working through at least three channels. First, lower transportation costs, removal of increase in multilateral global trade agreements, which contributed to expansion in global trade, have waned. Second, global value chains (GVCs) have slowed down sharply, partly due to rising labour costs in EMEs and partly on account of rising protectionism. Third, financial deepening which facilitated export activity has diminished. The interplay of these factors suggests that the relationship between growth and trade may be approaching a new normal (ECB, 2016). Following Constantinescu et al. (2015), an error correction model (ECM) on monthly data for the period January 2000 to July 2016 was specified as follows: where \u0394 denotes first difference, mt is world trade volume and yt is income represented by world IIP, is a constant, and t is the error term. The short-run trade elasticity is represented by , while the long-run trade elasticity is given by \u2013 Bai-Perron tests suggest at least three regimes in the model, viz., January 2000 to October 2008; November 2008 to April 2011; and May 2011 to July 2016, broadly coinciding with the pre-crisis period, the crisis period and the post-crisis period. Over the three regimes, the long-run elasticity continuously declined from 1.9 to 0.8. As for the short-term elasticity, it increased sharply to 0.9 during the crisis period from 0.5 in the pre-crisis period, before falling to 0.4 in the succeeding regime. Thus, global trade is unlikely to grow as fast as in the past even when global growth recovers fully in the medium-term. However, recovery in regional trade growth could diverge significantly as shown by a VAR analysis.1 The (contd.) 1 It consists of two endogenous variables (world IIP growth and corresponding region trade growth) with three lags based on lag length selection criteria. All variables are seasonally adjusted using X12 ARIMA and in log difference form. impulse response functions (IRFs) of trade to a shock to world IIP growth show: (i) the impact is more on AEs than EMEs; (ii) among AEs, the impact is most on Japan, followed by the US and the Euro area; and (iii) among EMEs, the impact is most in Latin America but highly fluctuating, while Africa and the Middle East are the least affected (Charts a and b). Global supply/demand conditions and expectations of a faster pace of economic recovery continued to drive commodity prices. Crude oil prices rose to a multi- year high in December 2016 after OPEC members agreed to cut production in end-November 2016 (Chart V.3). Since then, crude oil prices have remained largely range bound as shale production is expected to increase on the back of a higher oil rig count in the US (Chart V.4a). Demand may, however, remain subdued without a sharp turnaround in growth of major oil importing EMEs. Strengthening of the US dollar may also put downward pressure on crude oil prices as there is generally an inverse relationship between US dollar and oil prices. This is also borne out by recent data from January 1, 2013 to March 31, 2017, which show significant negative correlation of 0.94 between dollar index and crude oil prices (WTI, Brent and Dubai Fateh). Prices of base metals were also bolstered markedly during November and December 2016 by strong demand from China and expectation of higher infrastructure spending in the US as proposed by the new administration. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) food price index, which had moderated during Q4:2016, increased markedly in the first two months of 2017, primarily driven by cereal prices. Gold prices fell significantly in Q4:2016. Expectations of an increase in fiscal spending in the US buoyed risk- on sentiment, leading to a fall in safe haven demand in November. The increase in long-term yields following the rate hike by the Federal Reserve in December led to a further fall in demand for gold. In 2017 so far, gold prices have recovered somewhat on political uncertainties in the US and Europe (Chart V.4b). With commodity and oil prices rebounding, spare capacity getting absorbed and inflation expectations firming up, there has been some uptick in inflation in major AEs in the recent period. Given the persisting economic slack, however, inflation remained below targets in most AEs. In the US, inflation sequentially accelerated in November and December to reach a level that was the highest since September 2014. However, core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation remained stable at around 1.8 per cent during January and February 2017. Furthermore, 1-year USD inflation swap rate, which is an indicator of inflation expectations, has been stable since March 2017. In the Euro area, inflation accelerated sequentially during December 2016 to February 2017 to 2.0 per cent, the highest since February 2013. However, core inflation remained steady and below 1.0 per cent. Similarly, in the UK, inflation rose to 2.3 per cent in February 2017 from 1.6 per cent in December, the highest since June 2014. By contrast, inflation in Japan, which turned positive in October after six consecutive months of deflation, remained low (Chart V.5a). Inflation in major EMEs behaved divergently, driven by exchange rate movements and idiosyncratic factors. In China, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, inflation remained low and well within the targets of central banks, despite some mild uptick in January due to food prices. In contrast, inflation ebbed in Brazil and Russia, helped by currency appreciation on the backdrop of recovery in commodity prices. In other major EMEs, inflation pressures remain a concern. In Turkey, high inflation trended further upward in recent months due to currency depreciation. High inflation has persisted in South Africa due to agricultural supply bottlenecks (Chart V.5b). has kept its monetary stance unchanged since the last easing effected in August in response to Brexit. The monetary stance was also left unchanged by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) in its meeting in March 2017. In major EMEs, the monetary policy stance has been driven by both domestic factors and the anticipation of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve. China raised its short term rates in March for the third time in three months. Turkey raised its policy rate in November to stem currency depreciation in the midst of domestic political uncertainty. Mexico raised its policy rate four times during November 2016 to March 2017 to counter currency depreciation and contain additional inflationary pressures arising from in gasoline prices by the government. In contrast, Brazil cut its policy rate four times between October 2016 and February 2017 to contain economic recession as inflationary pressure eased. Chile also reduced its policy rate in March 2017 (Chart V.6). In sum, monetary policy stance in EMEs has remained divergent. Even though the monetary policy stance has generally remained accommodative globally, the stimulus provided through asset purchase programmes appears to have passed its peak. With incoming data showing strengthening of the US economy, the Federal Reserve raised the target federal funds rate twice in December 2016 and March 2017. The Federal Reserve expects economic conditions to evolve in a manner that warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate. In contrast, the ECB extended the bond purchase programme to end-December 2017. For longer-lasting and smoother transmission of monetary stimulus, the extent of monthly purchases was reduced from the 60 billion, while 80 billion minimum maturity for bond purchases from two years to one year. The ECB has kept its policy rate unchanged since March 2016. The Bank of England In a generally improving macroeconomic environment beginning in the second half of 2016, global financial markets were influenced by three events, viz., the US election, expectations and materialisation of the policy rate hike by the Federal Reserve, and uncertainty surrounding the Brexit roadmap. reducing Sovereign bond yields in AEs rose further in Q4:2016. Expectations of fiscal stimulus and a quicker pace of normalisation in monetary policy led to a significant increase in US Treasury bond yields. Even as term premia increased, market-based measures of inflation compensation also contributed significantly to the rise in yields. In the Euro area, rising bond yields in late 2016 were boosted by the ECB\u2019s decision to reduce the quantum of monthly purchase of assets and to resort to purchase of shorter-dated and lower- yielding securities in December 2016. A rise in yield in the US also played a role in firming up of yields in the Euro area. Sovereign yields in the UK rose due to better than expected macroeconomic outcomes that obviated further monetary policy easing, and the rise in inflation following the sharp depreciation in the pound. In contrast, bond yields in Japan remained more or less flat at around zero as a result of active control of the yield curve by the Bank of Japan (Chart V.7a). In emerging markets, bond yields behaved divergently. Yields rose in many EMEs after the US election, especially in countries with greater trade linkages with the US such as Mexico. In China, better economic performance and an uptick in inflation also partly fuelled a rise in long-term bond yields. In contrast, bond yields declined in Brazil as the central bank cut the policy rate to counter recession. Similarly, bond yields declined in Russia as recovery in oil prices and currency appreciation helped in moderating inflation expectations. The optimism generated after the US election, alongside the strengthening of the global recovery in the later part of 2016, led to a strong rally in global equity markets. The MSCI World Index, which measures global equity prices, increased by 9.7 per cent between November 1, 2016 and April 3, 2017. In the US, equity prices of financial sector companies registered the largest gains on prospects of less regulation of the sector and higher interest earnings due to rising bond yields. In the Euro area, the improving macroeconomic environment played a major role in the recovery of equity prices, helped by improvement in the financial position of some European banks. In the case of Japan, the depreciation of the yen, which boosted corporate earnings via better export earnings, played a major role. Equity prices in EMEs fell initially due to capital outflows and on concerns of increasing trade protectionism and rising borrowing costs. Subsequently, however, equity prices recovered in most EMEs as capital outflows ceased and then reversed, as the initial exuberance about the US economy subsided and the stance of the Federal Reserve turned less hawkish. In Brazil and Russia, the recovery in commodity prices also buoyed equity markets (Chart V.7b). Currency markets have been driven mainly by anticipation of policy initiatives by the new US administration and monetary policy stances in major AEs. The US dollar appreciated against most currencies beginning early November. It reached a 14-year high in December, before some reversal in Q1:2017 on uncertainty in realisation of Trump administration\u2019s policy initiatives and expectations of a slower pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The euro depreciated against the US dollar on political uncertainty. The pound was volatile against the US dollar \u2013 it gained during late November and early December on expectations of a favourable deal with the EU, but depreciated in January 2017 on resurfacing of uncertainty in the deal. The Japanese yen depreciated as yield spreads between Japan and the US/Euro area widened, before narrowing somewhat in Q1 of 2017. Risk-on and risk-off behaviour and search for yields have been important drivers of portfolio flows in the recent period. During 2016, cross border capital flows were impacted mainly by the heightened uncertainty and abrupt political and policy changes. However, in the most recent period, portfolio flows have returned to EMEs, shrugging off the rise in interest rates in the US, as EMEs continue to provide attractive bond yields and return on equities. The currencies of EMEs have also depreciated sharply since November 2016. Central banks in several EMEs such as Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia and Turkey intervened in currency markets to stem the depreciation, leading to losses of reserves. Despite intervention, the Mexican peso depreciated sharply due to its close trade and financial linkages with the US. The Turkish lira depreciated due to its domestic political problems. Initial depreciation of currencies in major commodity exporting EMEs such as Brazil, Russia and South Africa reversed, as the rise in commodity prices provided tailwinds (Chart V.8). To sum up, the modest turnaround in global recovery since the latter part of the previous year is projected to strengthen further. While AEs are likely to consolidate economic recovery, the ongoing slowdown in EMEs could reverse. Despite some firming up, inflation in AEs is expected to largely remain stable going by the 1-year inflation swap rate in the US. Economic activity and financial markets will continue to be impacted by political and policy uncertainties as well as monetary policy moves by major AEs. ", "file9": "Taking NBFCs Inflation is expected to pick up from its recent lows as favourable base effects reverse and enhanced house rent allowances are disbursed to central government employees. Economic activity is expected to recover, with an improvement in the services sector, even as investment activity remains anaemic. Since the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) of April 2017, the macroeconomic setting for the conduct of monetary policy has undergone signi\ufb01 cant shifts. The gradual \ufb01 rming up of global growth, especially in advanced economies (AEs), has whetted a renewed search for returns that has buoyed global \ufb01 nancial markets. Capital \ufb02 ows to emerging market economies (EMEs) have resumed strongly, albeit with some differentiation in favour of jurisdictions that have relatively resilient fundamentals. These \ufb02 ows are likely to abate to an extent due to the upcoming unwinding of quantitative easing (QE) by the US Federal Reserve. In India, the slowdown of economic activity that set in from Q1 of 2016-17 and became pronounced in the second half of the year appears to have extended into the \ufb01 rst half of 2017-18. Looking ahead, some improvement in services may counterbalance the persisting weakness in industrial production. In\ufb02 ation underwent a dramatic decline, reaching a historic low in June, but as the prints for July and August portend, a gradually rising trajectory may take hold over the rest of 2017-18. Alongside these developments, there has been an improvement in external viability; the foreign exchange reserves were around 11.5 months of imports in September 2017 and over 4 times short- term external debt. Against this backdrop, the monetary policy committee (MPC) met in June and August under its pre-announced bi-monthly schedule. Following up on its decision to keep the policy rate unchanged in April 2017, the MPC maintained status quo in its June 2017 meeting. While taking note of the signi\ufb01 cant easing of in\ufb02 ation, the MPC observed that there is considerable uncertainty around the evolving in\ufb02 ation trajectory. Accordingly, it persevered with a neutral stance, while remaining watchful of incoming data, and noted that premature action risked disruptive policy reversals later and loss of credibility. In its August 2017 meeting, the MPC decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points (bps), noting that (i) the baseline path of headline in\ufb02 ation excluding the impact of house rent allowances (HRA) awarded under the recommendation of the seventh central pay commission (CPC) was likely to fall below the projection made in June to a little above 4 per cent by Q4; (ii) in\ufb02 ation excluding food and fuel had fallen signi\ufb01 cantly since May after remaining sticky through 2016-17; (iii) the roll-out of the GST during July 2017 had been relatively smooth; and (iv) the monsoon was expected to be normal. It judged, therefore, that several upside risks to the baseline in\ufb02 ation path had either reduced or not materialised. These factors opened up some space for monetary accommodation, especially after accounting for risks to the growth outlook. An interesting development has been the changing pro\ufb01 le of voting in the MPC. After a unanimous vote in its April meeting, the MPC\u2019s decision in June was by a majority. While \ufb01 ve members voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged, one member voted in favour of a 50 bps cut in the policy repo rate. In the August meeting of the MPC, four members voted for a policy repo rate cut of 25 bps, one member voted for a cut in the policy repo rate by 50 bps and one member voted for status quo. These patterns re\ufb02 ect diversity, individual experiences and intellectual independence. This development is in consonance with the cross- country evidence on MPCs with external membership (Table I.1). Chapters II and III present analyses of macroeconomic developments during 2017-18 so far that explain why in\ufb02 ation and growth of gross value added (GVA) undershot staff\u2019s projections set out in the April 2017 MPR. Moving on to the outlook, staff\u2019s assessment of the likely evolution of domestic and global macroeconomic and \ufb01 nancial conditions over 1 the forecast horizon remains broadly consistent with the baseline assumptions made in the April 2017 MPR (Table I.2). First, the spatial and temporal distribution of the south-west monsoon has been uneven and de\ufb01 cient in some parts of the country, which is expected to lead to a decline in kharif output. Second, global crude oil prices have moved in a relatively wide range of US$ 44- 57 per barrel over the past six months. Futures prices juxtaposed with the outlook for global production, demand and inventories suggest that crude prices could be around US$ 55 per barrel during the second half of 2017-18 (Chart I.1). Third, the exchange rate of the rupee has exhibited two-way movements vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar since March 2017 with an appreciating bias until July 2017, given the strength of capital in\ufb02 ows and the weakening of the US dollar US$ 50 per barrel during FY 2017-18 `65/US$ Normal for 2017 3.4 per cent in 2017 3.6 per cent in 2018 To remain within BE 2017- 18 (3.2 per cent of GDP) No major change US$ 55 per barrel during 2017-18: H2 Current level 5 per cent below LPA 3.5 per cent in 2017 3.6 per cent in 2018 To remain within BE 2017- 18 (3.2 per cent of GDP) No major change vis-\u00e0-vis other major currencies. The rupee has, however, reversed some recent gains with the announcement of the unwinding of QE by the Fed. Fourth, the outlook for global growth and trade remains broadly unchanged from the April 2017 assessment, with some acceleration relative to 2016 for both AEs and emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) (Chart I.2). During 2018, AEs are expected to lose some momentum, with \ufb01 scal policy in the US projected to be less expansionary than expected in April. In contrast, EMDEs are expected to sustain the recent pick-up in growth. Increases in international air freight and container port throughput along with the plateauing of export orders suggest that the world trade volume growth, after some strengthening in the third quarter of 2017, could moderate towards the end of the year.1 This could have implications for staff\u2019s baseline outlook for external demand. The softness in headline in\ufb02 ation observed during April-June 2017 is projected to reverse in the coming months. First, the prices of food items, especially of vegetables \u2013 which declined sharply in Q1 (April-June) as against the typical seasonal \ufb01 rming up in these months \u2013 have started edging higher. Second, the Central Government has implemented the increase in HRA for its employees effective July 2017. Third, there was a broad-based rebound in the various underlying measures of in\ufb02 ation in July-August 2017, reversing in large part the softness seen during April-June. In\ufb02 ation expectations of economic agents play a key role in shaping the actual outcome through wages and price-setting behaviour. Quantitative in\ufb02 ation expectations of urban households eased by 30-60 bps in the September 2017 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey from the June 2017 round.2 Respondent households expected in\ufb02 ation to be 7.2 per cent three months ahead and 8.0 per cent a year ahead. In terms of qualitative responses, however, the proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate rose over both the three-month and the one year horizons (Chart I.3). Manufacturing \ufb01 rms polled in the September 2017 round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey expected some softening in inputs costs a quarter ahead, both for raw materials and staff costs.3 The respondents also expected some moderation in selling prices, indicating weak pricing power (Chart I.4). In the Nikkei\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 survey for September 2017, \ufb01 rms in the manufacturing sector faced input and output price pressures from higher tax rates and prices of steel and petroleum products; \ufb01 rms in the services sector in August 2017 faced price pressures from higher tax rates. Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in September 2017 expected CPI in\ufb02 ation to pick up to 4.5 per cent by Q4:2017-18, with the ebbing away of favourable base effects (Chart I.5)4. Their medium- term in\ufb02 ation expectations (5 years ahead) remained 2 The Reserve Bank\u2019s inflation expectations survey of households is conducted in 18 cities and the results of the September 2017 survey are based on responses from 4,996 households. 3 The September round results are based on responses from 1,141 companies. 4 30 forecasters participated in the September round of the Reserve Bank\u2019s survey of professional forecasters. unchanged at 4.3 per cent, while the longer-term in\ufb02 ation expectations (10 years ahead) rose by 10 bps to 4.1 per cent. Taking into account the revised assumptions on initial conditions, signals from forward looking surveys and estimates from structural and other models, CPI in\ufb02 ation is projected to pick up from 3.4 per cent during August 2017 to 4.2 per cent in Q3:2017-18 and 4.6 per cent in Q4, re\ufb02 ecting the combined effects of unfavourable base effects, the upturn in food prices and the impact of the increase in the HRA (a statistical effect on the CPI index) announced by the Central Government (Chart I.6). The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent con\ufb01 dence intervals for in\ufb02 ation in Q4:2017-18 are 3.3-6.0 per cent and 2.6-6.8 per cent, respectively. For 2018-19, assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous shocks, structural model estimates indicate that in\ufb02 ation is expected to increase from 4.6 per cent in Q1 to 4.9 per cent in Q3 and then soften to 4.5 per cent by Q4:2018-19 as the statistical impact of the Central Government\u2019s HRA enhancement fades. The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent con\ufb01 dence intervals for Q4:2018-19 are 2.7-6.5 per cent and 1.7- 7.5 per cent, respectively. There are upside as well as downside risks to these baseline forecasts. The major upside risks emanate from the expected increases in salaries and allowances by State Governments; the possible \ufb01 scal slippages due to farm loan waivers by some States and potential stimulus measures by the Central Government (Box I.1); short-term uncertainty around the GST impact; and the expected decline in the production Five States \u2013 Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka and Rajasthan \u2013 have announced farm loan waivers in 2017-18 so far. Two of these states \u2013 Uttar Pradesh and Punjab \u2013 have made provisions for the likely increase in expenditure in their budgets for 2017- 18. During 2014-2016, three States \u2013 Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu \u2013 had announced farm loan waivers aggregating `470 billion, but staggered over \ufb01 ve years. There are reports of a few more States considering farm loan waivers. Furthermore, against the backdrop of the growth slowdown, the Central Government might undertake policy actions to provide a boost to growth. Slowing growth could also have some adverse impact on tax revenues. The Central Government\u2019s \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit could potentially widen on account of these factors. Taking these developments into considerations, the combined (Centre plus States) \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit to GDP ratio may increase by around 100 bps in 2017-18. there are reports Higher \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cits per se can lead to an increase in in\ufb02 ation expectations and actual in\ufb02 ation (Catao and Terrones, 2005). Moreover, budget constraints might force some of the States to reduce their capital expenditure. If capital/infrastructural constraints are binding, a reduction in capital expenditure may turn out to be in\ufb02 ationary as costs \u2013 including time value/ opportunity cost of delays and material damages \u2013 go up as a result of capacity restraints becoming even more acute and due to attendant \u201ccongestion charges\u201d. Higher market borrowings on the back of higher de\ufb01 cits can also put upward pressure on borrowing costs for the Centre and the States, which could spill over to the broader economy. the \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit and in\ufb02 ation, higher is the impact of an increase in the \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit on in\ufb02 ation (Mitra et al., 2017) (Chart A).5 With the combined \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit budgeted at 5.9 per cent for 2017-18, empirical estimates suggest that an increase in the \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit to GDP ratio by 100 bps could lead to a permanent increase of about 50 bps in in\ufb02 ation.

Empirical assessment suggests that: (a) there exists a long-run relationship between \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cits and in\ufb02 ation in India; (b) causality runs from \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cits to in\ufb02 ation; and (c) the impact of \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cits on in\ufb02 ation is non-linear, i.e., higher the initial levels of 5 The empirical relationship between in\ufb02 ation and \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit \u2013 the long-run as well as the short-run dynamics \u2013 is examined using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Cointegration approach proposed by Pesaran et al.

The variables are de\ufb01 ned as follows: \uf050 = log(1+CPI In\ufb02 ation); X = (GFD/GDP)2; OG = Output gap; LC = log of crude oil prices; LE = log of exchange rate (Rupees per US dollar). The non-linear relationship between in\ufb02 ation and \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit is captured by using log of in\ufb02 ation as the dependent variable and including the square of the \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit/ GDP ratio as an explanatory variable. These data transformations allow for the in\ufb02 ation-\ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit elasticity to change across in\ufb02 ation rates and \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit ratios. The empirical analysis uses quarterly data for 2006-17. of kharif foodgrains. In terms of downside risks, adequate food stocks and effective supply management measures by the government could keep food in\ufb02 ation lower than expected and pull down headline in\ufb02 ation below the baseline. The April 2017 MPR had projected an acceleration in real GVA for 2017-18 on the back of (a) a recovery in discretionary spending spurred by the pace of remonetisation; (b) the reduction in banks\u2019 lending rates on fresh loans brought about by demonetisation- induced liquidity; (c) the growth stimulating proposals in the Union Budget 2017-18; (d) a normal south- west monsoon; and (e) an improvement in external demand. Stressed balance sheets of banks and the possibility of higher global commodity prices were seen as downside risks to growth prospects. Some of these expectations have materialised, whereas the recovery in discretionary and investment spending has been weaker than expected and kharif foodgrains production is expected to be lower than last year in view of the shortfall and irregular rainfall during the south-west monsoon this year. The uncertainty about the implementation of GST also appears to have had some impact on economic activity, although it is expected to be offset by productivity-enhancing effects in the medium- and long-run. Consumer con\ufb01 dence dipped in the September 2017 round of the RBI\u2019s survey on declining optimism Overall optimism in the manufacturing sector for the quarter ahead improved in the September round of the RBI\u2019s industrial outlook survey on account of better prospects for production, order books, capacity utilisation, exports and pro\ufb01 t margins, even as the current assessment dropped further (Chart I.8).

Source: RBI staff estimates; and Survey of Professional Forecasters (September 2017). In the September round of the RBI\u2019s survey, professional forecasters expected real GVA growth to pick up from 5.6 per cent in Q1:2017-18 to 7.2 per cent in Q4:2017-18 and to 7.5 per cent in Q2:2018-19, led by improvement in industry and services sector activity (Chart I.9 and Table I.4). Taking into account the outturn in the \ufb01 rst half, the baseline assumptions, survey indicators and model forecasts, real GVA growth is projected at 6.7 per cent for 2017-18 \u2013 6.4 per cent in Q2, 7.1 per cent in Q3 and 7.7 per cent in Q4 \u2013 with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path. For 2018-19, structural model estimates indicate that real GVA may grow by 7.4 per cent, assuming a normal monsoon, \ufb01 scal consolidation in line with the announced trajectory, and no major exogenous/policy shocks (Chart I.10). Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models are workhorse tools for policy analysis by a number of central banks. In the RBI, efforts are underway to develop such a model to enrich analytical inputs for the conduct of future monetary policy (Box I.2). The baseline projections of growth and in\ufb02 ation are inter alia conditional on the assumptions set out in Table I.1. A caveat is that the baseline growth and in\ufb02 ation trajectories do not incorporate the impact of the likely increases in pay and allowances by State Built on microeconomic foundations, DSGE models emphasise agents\u2019 inter-temporal choice and assign a central role to agents\u2019 expectations around the determination of macroeconomic outcomes. These models are able to generate outcomes from policy simulations (or counterfactuals) that are not explicitly susceptible to the Lucas (1976) critique of traditional reduced-form macro-econometric models using representations that may not be robust to shifts in the underlying economic structure induced by changes in policy. Given the general equilibrium nature, the DSGE models can capture the interplay between policy actions and agents\u2019 behaviour (Sbordone et al, 2010). The earliest DSGE model, representing an economy without distortions, was the real business cycle model that focused on the effects of productivity shocks (Kydland and Prescott, 1982). Since then, there has been considerable improvement in speci\ufb01 cation and estimation techniques. Current DSGE models embody a wider set of distortions and shocks than earlier generation efforts (Christiano et al., 2005; Smets and Wouters, 2007). where \uf062 is the subjective discount factor, \u00b5 is the inverse of the Frisch inter-temporal elasticity, W stands for real wages, t is the rate of in\ufb02 ation and rt is the gross nominal interest rate. There is a continuum of intermediate goods producing \ufb01 rms that manufacture Yt(i) units of differentiated intermediate good i using the following technology: where zt is an exogenous productivity shock which follows a random walk with drift. The representative intermediate goods producing \ufb01 rm chooses the price Pt(i) to maximise the total market value, subject to the demand schedule of the \ufb01 nal goods producer, technology constraint and quadratic price adjustment , where \uf057 is the degree of cost given by price adjustment cost. Solving the \ufb01 rst order condition of this optimisation exercise produces the non-linear new Keynesian Phillips curve given by Several central banks, both in AEs and EMEs \u2013 Bank of Canada; Bank of England; European Central Bank; Central Bank of Chile to name a few \u2013 have developed such models for policy analysis and employ them extensively to evaluate alternative policy scenarios and instrument choices. A prototype New Keynesian DSGE model for India would need to be calibrated to country speci\ufb01 c conditions. Drawing on Ireland (2004), the economy is hypothesised to be inhabited by a representative household which maximises a lifetime expected utility function, subject to an inter-temporal budget constraint. The felicity function7 depends on consumption (C) and labour (l) supplied to the intermediate goods producing sector. The \ufb01 rst-order condition of household optimisation consists of (i) the Euler equation which relates the real interest rate to the inter-temporal marginal rate of substitution; and (ii) an inter-temporal optimality condition linking the real wage to the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and consumption. where \uf074 is the price elasticity of output8. The equation states that the \ufb01 rm sets prices as a mark-up over marginal costs, taking into consideration quadratic price adjustment costs (Mumtaz and Zanetti, 2013). As Ireland (2004) explains, the intermediate \ufb01 rm \ufb01 xes its mark-up of price Pt(i) over marginal cost in proportion to \uf074/(\uf074\u20131) in the absence of costly price adjustment. With price adjustment cost, a \ufb01 rm\u2019s actual mark-up would deviate from the desired mark-up and gravitate towards the latter over time. The central bank sets the nominal interest rate according to the Taylor rule: where rss and yss are the steady-state interest rate and steady-state output, respectively, and \uf065t is an exogenous (Contd...) 7 The household maximises provides rate between t and t+1.

The household uses this money to purchase new bonds of value , where is policy shock. Equations (1)-(5), along with the market- clearing condition, constitute the system of equations which can be solved using standard DSGE methods. 9 The model parameters can be calibrated to various Indian studies (Patra and Kapur, 2012). In this prototype model, it is possible then to run counter-factual exercises, e.g., simulate the economy wide effect of an expansionary monetary policy a la the reduction in the policy repo rate as in the third bi-monthly monetary policy statement of August 2, 2017. An expansionary monetary policy shock reduces interest rate and raises Governments for their employees. This section makes an assessment of the balance of risks around the baseline projections from a set of plausible alternative scenarios. In the baseline forecasts, the crude oil (Indian basket) price is assumed to average around US$ 55 per barrel in the second half of 2017-18 on the expectation that the global oil supply would be suf\ufb01 cient to meet increasing global demand. However, supply 9 A multi-sectoral model can enrich the dynamics by accommodating \ufb01 nancial frictions re\ufb02 ecting the role of credit from banks as well as non-bank \ufb01 nancial institutions, the external sector, the agriculture sector and the Government sector. Illustratively, such models can replicate the economic implications of \ufb01 scal stimulus or pass-through of international shocks. output, consumption and in\ufb02 ation, as illustrated in Chart B. Christiano, L.J., L. Eichenbaum, and C.L. Evans (2005), \u201cNominal Rigidities and Dynamic Effects of a Shock to Monetary Policy\u201d, Journal of Political Economy, 113 (1), 1-45. disruptions due to geo-political developments with oil demand remaining robust could push crude oil prices higher. The upward pressures on oil prices could, however, get mitigated by the increased production of shale gas in response to higher prices. Assuming that crude oil prices reach US$ 65 in the second half of 2017-18 in this scenario, in\ufb02 ation could be higher by about 30 bps in 2017-18. Real GVA growth could weaken by around 15 bps in 2017-18 due to the direct impact of higher input costs as well as spillovers from lower world demand. If, in contrast, crude oil prices soften below the baseline due to oversupply by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and/or weaker than anticipated global demand and in particular, fall to around US$ 50, in\ufb02 ation may moderate by about 15 bps, with a boost to real GVA growth of around 5-10 bps above the baseline in 2017-18 (Charts I.11 and I.12). Global demand is expected to be higher in 2017 and 2018 in the baseline scenario with both upside and downside risks to the outlook. On the downside, the expected demand boost from expansionary US \ufb01 scal policy may not materialise, given recent developments in the US. In China, growth has remained resilient, but concerns over its sustainability remain in view of the large overhang of debt. Persisting disconnect between market participants\u2019 assessment and that of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) over the pace of US monetary policy normalisation could trigger volatility in \ufb01 nancial markets, especially in view of stretched market valuations. The ensuing tightening of global \ufb01 nancial conditions in a milieu of inward-looking protectionist tendencies could amplify downside risks, especially for EMEs. Assuming global growth turns out to be 50 bps below the baseline, domestic growth and in\ufb02 ation could fall below the baseline forecasts by around 20 bps and 10 bps, respectively. However, reduced political risks in the euro area could lead to a more sustained and stronger cyclical rebound, providing a boost to global growth. Assuming that global growth is higher by 25 bps, real GVA growth and in\ufb02 ation could turn out to be around 10 bps and 5 bps, respectively, above the baseline. The exchange rate of the Indian rupee has exhibited two-way movements vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar during the \ufb01 rst half of 2017-18. Going forward, the normalisation of monetary policy in the US (and possibly other central banks in AEs) and protectionist policies of major AEs and EMEs could lead to some volatility in the foreign exchange market and downward pressures on the exchange rate. A depreciation of the Indian rupee by around 5 per cent relative to the baseline could raise in\ufb02 ation by around 20 bps in 2017-18, while producing some positive impact on net exports and growth. On the other hand, in view of the robust growth prospects of the Indian economy in a cross- country perspective and the various initiatives to attract foreign direct investment, India is likely to remain an attractive destination for foreign investors and this could lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency. An appreciation of the Indian rupee by 5 per cent could soften in\ufb02 ation by around 20 bps but also deliver a negative impact of 10-15 bps on real GVA growth. The substantial softening of headline in\ufb02 ation in the \ufb01 rst quarter of 2017-18 re\ufb02 ected the absence of the usual seasonal pick up in food prices in the post-winter period, especially pulses and vegetables. These food price dynamics may have both structural and cyclical elements, although it is dif\ufb01 cult to disentangle them at this juncture. If the softening in food in\ufb02 ation observed since the second half of 2016 is largely structural, then the momentum in food prices in the rest of 2017-18 could be negligible and headline in\ufb02 ation could be below the baseline by up to 2 percentage points. If however, low food in\ufb02 ation turns out to be largely cyclical, food prices are likely to revert to trend. Assuming that the momentum in the food prices in the coming months is in line with the average of the past \ufb01 ve years, headline in\ufb02 ation may turn out to be 100 bps above the baseline. The impact of increased salaries and pensions of Central Government employees in 2016 and the implementation of HRA effective July 2017 has been embedded in the baseline forecasts. Assuming that State Governments implement a similar order of increase in their pay and allowances, CPI in\ufb02 ation could go up to 100 bps above the baseline on account of the direct statistical effect of higher house rents with possible indirect effects emanating from higher demand and increase in in\ufb02 ation expectations. As noted earlier, there are upside risks to the Central Government\u2019s \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit from possible measures to provide a boost to domestic demand and from lower tax revenues. Assuming that the Central Government\u2019s \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit/GDP ratio widens by 50 bps in 2017-18, in\ufb02 ation could be around 25 bps above the baseline. To conclude, the growth outlook is expected to improve in the second half of 2017-18, although it could be weighed down by still sluggish investment and export activity. Higher food prices and the increase in house rent allowances by the Central Government for its employees are expected to result in an increase in headline in\ufb02 ation in the second half of 2017-18. There are upside risks to the in\ufb02 ation outlook from (i) the lower kharif foodgrains output; (ii) farm loan waivers by some State Governments and possibility of Central Government stimulus; and (iii) the implementation of higher pay and allowances by the State Governments for their employees, which will impact the baseline projections of growth and in\ufb02 ation as they materialise. Consumer price inflation fell sharply in the first quarter of 2017-18, driven down by a collapse in food inflation and a marked moderation in inflation in other components. The trajectory reversed in July and August as vegetable prices spiked and prices of other goods and services firmed up. Input costs tracked movements in international commodity prices, while wage growth in the organised and rural sectors firmed up modestly. The MPR of April 2017 had projected consumer price index (CPI) in\ufb02 ation1 to increase to 4.2 per cent in Q1:2017-18 and further to 4.7 per cent in Q2 on the expectation that the compression imposed by demonetisation on perishable food prices would wane, and the usual seasonal uptick that characterises pre-monsoon months would take over. In the event, in\ufb02 ation developments in the \ufb01 rst half of 2017- 18 were foreshadowed by the prolonged impact of food supply shocks. Consequently, actual in\ufb02 ation outcomes were pushed much below their projected path. First, food prices sank into de\ufb02 ation in May and June 2017. Second, crude prices fell in April, remaining soft and range-bound in ensuing months; combined with an appreciating exchange rate, this resulted in a sharp disin\ufb02 ation in petrol and diesel prices in the early part of 2017-18. In the fuel group, lique\ufb01 ed petroleum gas (LPG) prices declined in the \ufb01 rst quarter of 2017-18, tracking international prices. Third, in\ufb02 ation excluding food and fuel also eased signi\ufb01 cantly in Q1:2017-18, pending price revisions ahead of goods and services tax (GST) implementation. The cumulative impact was that headline in\ufb02 ation plunged to 2.2 per cent in Q1:2017-18 and 2.9 per cent in the \ufb01 rst two months of Q2 \u2013 signi\ufb01 cantly lower than the assessment made at the time of the April MPR. Although these forces continue to drive a wedge between actual and projected in\ufb02 ation in terms of levels, a directional alignment is gradually occurring since July (Chart II.1a). Large and unanticipated supply shocks have produced at least two systematic deviations of actual and projected in\ufb02 ation in terms of the new index (Chart II.1b). Both capture signi\ufb01 cant underlying shifts in demand-supply balances in key in\ufb02 ation-sensitive goods and services, which should have warranted policy responses of a scale and range beyond the narrow remit of monetary policy. After the January 2017 trough, consumer price in\ufb02 ation increased for two months in succession to reach 3.9 per cent in March. Thereafter, in\ufb02 ation started declining sharply to reach a historic low 1 Headline in\ufb02 ation is measured by year-on-year changes in all-India CPI Combined (Rural + Urban). of 1.5 per cent in June (Chart II.2), driven by the base effects that took the prices of food items down dramatic decline was accentuated by the dampening monsoon. In\ufb02 ation excluding food and fuel also declined sharply from 5 per cent in March to 3.8 per of goods and services constituting this category came from favourable base effects offsetting positive but weak momentum (Chart II.3a, b and c). The sharp disin\ufb02 ation in CPI from 3.7 per cent in the second half of 2016-17 to 2.5 per cent in the \ufb01 rst half of this year impacted the in\ufb02 ation distribution. The moderation in the central tendency of the distribution was also accompanied by an increase in kurtosis and a considerable negative skew, as against a positive skew during the corresponding period a year ago (Chart II.4). On a seasonally adjusted basis, prices of most items registered increases and the diffusion indices2 for goods, services and the overall CPI were well above 50 (Chart II.5). In July and August 2017, the incidence of delayed spikes in prices of vegetables within an overall \ufb01 rming up of prices of goods and services in the run up to the GST implementation reversed the trajectory of headline in\ufb02 ation and diffusion indices rose sharply, indicating renewed broad-basing of price pressures. A historical decomposition3 of in\ufb02 ation shows that large supply shocks dominated the disin\ufb02 ation of the \ufb01 rst half of 2017-18, contributing 3.6 percentage points to it. This con\ufb01 rms the vulnerability of the Indian economy to exogenous shocks, viz., oil prices, and disruptions impacting the agriculture sector in 2 The CPI diffusion index, a measure of dispersion of price changes, categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen, remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month. A reading above 50 for the diffusion index signals a broad expansion or the extent of generalisation of price increases and a reading below 50 signals a broad- based de\ufb02 ation. 3 Historical decompositions are used to estimate the individual contribution of each shock to movements in in\ufb02 ation over the sample period based on a Vector Auto Regression (VAR) with the following variables (represented as the vector Yt): annual growth rate in crude oil prices in Indian rupees, in\ufb02 ation, output gap measured by using the Hodrick\u2013Prescott \ufb01 lter, annual growth rate of rural wages and the policy repo rate. The VAR can be written in companion form as: Yt =c + A Yt-1 + et; where et represents a vector of shocks [oil price shock; supply shock (in\ufb02 ation shock); output gap shock; wage shock; and policy shock]. Using Wold decomposition, Yt can be represented as a function of deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation allows to decompose the deviation of in\ufb02 ation from the deterministic trend as the sum of contributions from various shocks. spite of the diversi\ufb01 cation and weather proo\ufb01 ng of the agricultural sector sought to be achieved by policy interventions over time. These developments may warrant a re-appraisal of the scope and quality of food management strategies that seem prone to failure in the face of shocks in either direction. In the past too, supply shocks, of which large one-sided deviations of in\ufb02 ation from projections are merely a symptom, drove disin\ufb02 ation episodes. The softening of oil prices in conjunction with exchange rate appreciation and the negative output gap, possibly due to weak credit growth, also contributed to the disin\ufb02 ation (Chart II.6a). Drilling down into granular constituents, non-durable goods, which account for 66 per cent of the CPI basket and include items such as petrol and diesel in addition to food items, were the main drivers of the disin\ufb02 ation. The contribution of services, on the other hand, remained broadly unchanged. The reversal in July and August was driven by in\ufb02 ation in non-durables which rebounded, led by food prices (Chart II.6b). Turning to a disaggregated analysis of food in\ufb02 ation, this recent experience with a disin\ufb02 ation episode yields several lessons that should inform the setting of macroeconomic policies going forward in order to pre-empt widespread distress in the farm economy or at least, to mitigate it. The precipitous decline in food prices appears to have overwhelmed supply downshift in momentum commenced as early as the \ufb01 rst quarter of 2017-18, affording lead time for course 2016 to June 2017 [(-)2.3 per cent] was in stark contrast rate of 6.3 per cent (Chart II.7). Two factors stand out in this experience as noteworthy. First, the unusually coincided with larger than usual arrivals in mandis which did not get contemporaneously picked up by agri-information alerts. Also highly unusual were the suspects \u2013 potatoes; onions; tomatoes \u2013 indicating the extent of dislocation caused by oversupply, since other vegetables do not typically exhibit signi\ufb01 cant seasonal swings. Second, there was a massive cent by July-August 2017 contributed by all items in the pulses group (Chart II.8). It was preceded, second half of 2015-16 which should have \ufb02 ashed in lead monitors of the pulses economy. In the absence of corrective action, the combination of augmented availability and inadequate procurement/marketing operations yielded a supply glut with which food supply management logistics failed to cope. As regards speci\ufb01 c components in the food category, pulses constitute 2.4 per cent of the CPI and 5.2 per cent of the food category. The decline in prices of pulses contributed (-)1.4 percentage points to the food de\ufb02 ation during May and June and (-)0.7 percentage points to headline disin\ufb02 ation (Chart II.9). Historically, domestic production and imports of pulses have consistently lagged behind the level of domestic demand, resulting in in\ufb02 ationary pressures on the headline. Drawing upon this experience, the Government put in place several measures to augment supply during 2016-17, which inter alia included increasing the minimum support prices (MSPs) to incentivise farmers to increase acreage (MSP for kharif and rabi pulses increased in the range of 7.7-9.2 per cent and 14.3-16.2 per cent, respectively, in 2016-17); continuing zero import duty on pulses to augment domestic availability of pulses at reasonable prices (import duty of 10 per cent was imposed on tur in March 2017 to prevent prices from falling below MSPs); restricting exports (tur, moong and urad dal have been made free for exports, effective September 15, 2017); creating buffer stocks of pulses for the \ufb01 rst time through involvement of agencies such as the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED), and the Small Farmers\u2019 Agri Business Consortium (SFAC); discouraging hoarding by putting stock limits on pulses for traders (which were lifted in May 2017); and taking measures for revitalising the agriculture sector in general.4 With the domestic availability of pulses (domestic production and imports) increasing to 29.6 million tonnes in 2016-17 from 22.2 million tonnes in 2015- 16, the prices of pulses declined below their long- term trend as well as the MSPs in several mandis (Charts II.10a, b and c). This re\ufb02 ected the large gap in procurement relative to supply and the unanticipated shock to farmers\u2019 expectations on price support. In the case of vegetables, prices fell signi\ufb01 cantly since August 2016, with statistical tests suggesting a trend 4 Measures, inter alia, include issuing soil health cards to all farmers to provide information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendation on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and its fertility; Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana to help expand cultivated area with assured irrigation, reducing wastage of water and improving water use ef\ufb01 ciency; onboarding 455 markets (out of 585 regulated market) in 13 states on the e-marketing platform under the National Agriculture Market scheme (eNAM) \u2013 as on September 8, 2017, 47.95 lakh farmers and 91,500 traders have registered on the e-NAM portal. break5 that altered their evolution incipiently under the cover of the transitory effects of demonetisation. A sequence of positive shocks brought about this sub- trend deviation. What started off as the reversal of the summer spike in August was followed by the sharp and more than seasonal winter price correction. Fire- sales post demonetisation set the stage for a plunge in the prices of other vegetables (cabbage; cauli\ufb02 ower; palak/other leafy vegetables; brinjal; gourd, peas and beans) during November-December 2016, which usually exhibit little seasonality, as stated earlier. Finally, there has been an unusually soft pickup in vegetable prices during the early months of 2017 (Charts II.11 and II.12). This was due to large arrivals of key vegetables during these months. These 5 Monthly series of the CPI vegetable price index from January 2012 to June 2017 is decomposed into trend, cyclical, seasonal and irregular components using a univariate unobserved components model (UCM). The Supremum Wald test indicates a statistically signi\ufb01 cant break in August 2016, with the post-break trend sloping negatively. Comparing the observed vegetable price index with an index constructed by imputing the pre-break trend on to the post-break decomposition reveals a 6-10 percentage points deviation in in\ufb02 ation in 2017. Several caveats are in order: (i) the break is at the end of the sample; (ii) the post-break trend is negative sloping which means that reduction in prices on an enduring basis, controlling for other shocks and seasonality, is unlikely; and (iii) the July and August 2017 data already indicate a sharp reversal in vegetable prices. These need to be considered while interpreting the break as a structural change.represented as a function of deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et. This formulation allows the decomposition of the deviation of in\ufb02 ation from its deterministic trend as the sum of contributions from various shocks. developments underscore the need for high frequency data and monitoring of prices, mandi arrivals, supply- demand balances and stock positions, especially with respect to horticulture. In Q2 so far, food in\ufb02 ation has edged up on the back of a sharp rise in vegetables prices, driven by a spike in tomato and onion prices (Chart II.11). In the case of tomatoes, sudden price movements propelled in\ufb02 ation in the item from (-)40.8 per cent in June 2017 to 49.9 per cent in July and further to 94.0 per cent in August. This was mainly on account of supply disruptions due to farmers\u2019 agitations in Maharashtra in June and adverse weather conditions in important production centres. In early August, upside pressures also built up in onion prices, pushing onion in\ufb02 ation to 49.3 per cent in August from (-)10 per cent in July, reportedly due to damage caused by July rains and large procurement by a few State Governments. The sharp increase in these prices in retail markets re\ufb02 ects a statistically signi\ufb01 cant increase in margins6 in Q2:2017-18. Further analysis based on CPI regional prices data suggests that there is no signi\ufb01 cant difference in the changes in vegetable prices in urban and rural areas \u2013 the spike in vegetable prices has uniformly impacted rural and urban India.7 Among other food items, prices of spices moved into de\ufb02 ation territory since June 2017 on account of a fall in prices of chillies, dhania and black pepper. As per the 3rd advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture, production of spices recorded a growth of 17.4 per cent in 2016-17, up from 14.4 per cent a year ago. Sugar in\ufb02 ation, which was in double digits during 2016-17 (averaging 20 per cent), also eased in 2017-18 so far (up to August), largely due to measures 6 Margin is measured as the difference between the retail and the wholesale price. The increase in margins is statistically signi\ufb01 cant at 5 per cent level. The kernel density function also suggests signi\ufb01 cant increases in onion and tomato prices and margins across a majority of the centres during July and August as compared to May and June 2017. 7 Based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) framework. facilitating imports and on expectations of higher domestic production. In\ufb02 ation in prices of animal proteins and milk has declined as momentum was weak and base effects favourable. Cereal in\ufb02 ation remained low and moved with a softening bias due to higher availability \u2013 production was higher and stocks were up by 5.09 million tonnes.8 Import duty on wheat that was reduced to zero in December 2016 was re-imposed in March 2017. In the fuel and light group, in\ufb02 ation picked up at the start of the \ufb01 nancial year but softened transiently in May-June before resuming an upturn in July and August. The decision to allow oil marketing companies (OMCs) to raise subsidised kerosene and LPG prices in a calibrated manner has enhanced the responsiveness of prices of domestic household fuel items to international price benchmarks. The contribution of electricity to overall fuel in\ufb02 ation remained more or less unchanged in H1:2017-18 in relation to the corresponding period of last year, while that of \ufb01 rewood moderated (Chart II.13). Growth in electricity generation9 decelerated during Q1:2017- 18 to 5.3 per cent (from a robust base of 10 per cent last year) on account of subdued performance of the manufacturing sector; though it has accelerated 8 Total stock of rice, wheat and coarse cereals as at end-August 2017 compared to end-August 2016. 9 Electricity generation is based on the index of industrial production (IIP). signi\ufb01 cantly in the months of July and August with a growth rate of 7.5 per cent (from 2.1 per cent last year) with reports of surge in rural demand for irrigation. The long-term thermal-based power tariff through power purchasing agreements (PPA) by distribution companies (DISCOMs), the dominant source of electricity, has remained broadly unchanged. However, spot price of electricity reported on energy exchanges, which was broadly the same as last year till April 2017, have started rising from May 2017 onwards. Turning to the underlying in\ufb02 ation dynamics, CPI in\ufb02 ation excluding food and fuel edged down by 120 basis points during the year up to June. The softness in prices of petrol and diesel within the transport and communication group contributed substantially to the observed moderation in Q1 (Chart II.14). Excluding petrol and diesel prices from this category too, in\ufb02 ation moderated (Chart II.15). The sudden and sharp decline in in\ufb02 ation excluding food, fuel, petrol and diesel in Q1:2017-18 was driven by goods as well as services. Among goods, much of the moderation was in prices of personal care and effects due to a fall in the rate of change of domestic gold prices in tandem with international prices. In\ufb02 ation in respect of goods within the health sub-group and clothing also eased, pending price revisions held back ahead of GST, while clearance sales depressed in\ufb02 ation in the case of clothing (Chart II.16a). Services in\ufb02 ation eased during Q1:2017-18 in a broad- based manner. In\ufb02 ation in respect of education services moderated signi\ufb01 cantly, possibly on account of the revised school fee payment cycle for central school boards for the academic year. Lower in\ufb02 ation was recorded in transportation fares as fuel prices remained range-bound, coupled with food in\ufb02 ation \u2013 a major determinant of the cost of living \u2013 being lower than in the recent past. Prices of mobile communication expenses eased signi\ufb01 cantly, triggered by pricing war in the telecommunication sector. Housing in\ufb02 ation also moderated in Q1, re\ufb02 ecting lower rates of increase in rentals (Chart II.16b). Thereafter, in July and August, there was a broad based pickup in CPI in\ufb02 ation excluding food and fuel. In\ufb02 ation in transport and communication registered sharp increase driven by petrol and diesel (Chart II.14). Household goods and services; pan, tobacco and intoxicants; health; recreation; and clothing and footwear sub-groups also rose. This partly re\ufb02 ected the hike in the service tax rate under GST and the impact of GST on certain goods, especially packaged/ processed food; clothing and footwear; and recreation and amusement services. Housing in\ufb02 ation reversed with the implementation of house rent allowance (HRA) increases by the Centre from July. As a result, all other exclusion based measures also registered a pickup in Q2 so far (Chart II.15). The GST was rolled out in July 2017. The assessment at the current juncture is that price changes are not likely to have any material impact on headline in\ufb02 ation. However, in case the price increases show downward rigidity due to uncertainty in GST implementation, in\ufb02 ationary impact may emerge (Box II.1). In May 2017, the base year of wholesale price index (WPI) was revised from 2004-05 to 2011-12 to align it with the base year of other macroeconomic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP) and the index The goods and services (GST) has been implemented from July 1, 2017 with the GST Council broadly approving a \ufb01 ve-tier rate structure, viz., 0 per cent for commodities such as fruits, vegetables, milk, handloom, select agricultural implements and newspapers; 5 per cent for coal, sugar, tea, coffee, edible oil, economy air fares among others; 12 per cent for select processed foods among others; 18 per cent for non-durables and most of the services; and 28 per cent for most consumer durable goods and recreation services. Non-processed food items, education, health care, real estate, electricity and fuel items like petrol and diesel are exempted from the GST. A rate of 3 per cent has also been speci\ufb01 ed for gold. The major indirect taxes that were subsumed under the GST include the excise duty, the service tax, Central sales tax and State value added tax (VAT). In order to arrive at the direct impact of the GST structure on the CPI, a comparison of the existing excise and State VAT/sales tax rates on CPI items vis-\u00e0-vis the GST rate structure is in order. Almost half of the CPI basket comprises food items that attracted zero excise and sales tax and they continue to be taxed at the zero rate under the new GST rate structure. Furthermore, petrol and diesel are outside the purview of the GST on which the existing taxation system (VAT and central excise duty) will continue. Hence, the impact of GST on CPI stems mainly from the tax rate differentials in respect of the remaining elements of the CPI basket. From an item level mapping of the earlier tax rates and the new GST rate structure, it is observed that among the major sub-groups, much of the increase in prices post-GST is estimated to occur in prepared meals, clothing and footwear and other sub-groups dominated by services such as recreation and amusement. The increase in prices of these items is to a large extent likely to be offset by declines in post- GST goods prices \u2013 particularly those in the household goods and services sub-group and personal care and effects as well as in select food sub-groups such as spices and pulses. Overall, taking into account the weighted contribution of the changes in the major sub-groups, CPI prices could increase by around 10 basis points on account of the new GST rate structure (Chart 1). As such, it is not expected to have any signi\ufb01 cant impact on CPI in\ufb02 ation. Estimates by other agencies also point to a muted impact of the new GST rate structure on CPI in\ufb02 ation10. However, as noted in the October 2016 MPR (Box II.I: In\ufb02 ation Impact of GST \u2013 Cross Country Evidence), the cross-country experience shows a one-off increase in prices in the \ufb01 rst year following the introduction of GST. This is likely on account of \ufb01 rms choosing to increase prices initially in response to the uncertainties surrounding the implementation of a new tax system and its impact on business processes. Similar behaviour by \ufb01 rms in India in response to GST implementation could result in some upside risk to the in\ufb02 ation assessment presented here. A dip stick survey was conducted by the Reserve Bank in select cities to assess the impact of implementation of GST on prices of eighteen commodities. The survey results suggest that the weighted average price of these commodities, with a weight of around 10.0 per cent in the CPI basket, is likely to have gone up by 0.8 per cent including the regular price change. Post-GST price rise is witnessed in textiles, footwear and utensils, whereas prices of two-wheelers and 10 The Economic Survey 2016-17 expects that the impact of GST will be de\ufb02 ationary in nature. While some analysts see CPI in\ufb02 ation recording a marginal uptick on the back of pickup in prices of food and tobacco, and services, few analysts expect that the impact of GST on in\ufb02 ation will depend on a variety of factors such as the ef\ufb01 ciency with which the input tax credit mechanism works and producers pass on tax cuts into \ufb01 nal prices. some fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) items have moderated. In case prices of commodities that have gone up show downward rigidity, the weighted average price increase could be higher at 1.5 per cent [Table 1, Column (4)]. of industrial production (IIP). The revision in the base year is also intended to capture structural changes in the economy and to improve the quality, coverage and representativeness of the index. In addition to an updated item basket, the revised WPI has included two new features in line with international best practices: (i) the use of the geometric mean for compilation of item-level indices; and (ii) the exclusion of indirect taxes from wholesale prices, thus bringing it conceptually closer to a producer price index. Re\ufb02 ecting these changes, headline WPI in\ufb02 ation in the new series declined by an average of one percentage point as compared with in\ufb02 ation calculated from the index with 2004-05 as base year during April 2013 to March 2017. After peaking in February, WPI in\ufb02 ation fell sharply up to June, but ticked up again in July and August following a sharp pickup in food prices. Between April and July, CPI trimmed means11 have softened; however, in August these registered an increase. Median in\ufb02 ation, a particular case of the trimmed mean, also declined, averaging 4.2 per cent since March 2017 (Chart II.17a). In\ufb02 ation measured by sectoral consumer price indices continued to undershoot headline CPI in\ufb02 ation, re\ufb02 ecting inter alia the higher weight of food in the former. Changes in GDP and gross value added (GVA) de\ufb02 ators have moved along with WPI in\ufb02 ation since the beginning of the year (Chart II.17b). In July and August, the movement in WPI in\ufb02 ation was consistent with that of headline CPI and all sectoral CPIs. 11 Trimmed means lessen noise by removing select proportions of upper and lower ends of the distribution corresponding to a chosen percentage of trim. They are used as indicators of underlying in\ufb02 ation behaviour. Underlying cost conditions have largely co-moved with measures of in\ufb02 ation, with the pickup in the last quarter of 2016-17 turning out to be transient. Industrial and farm costs captured under the WPI eased signi\ufb01 cantly in Q1:2017-18 (Chart II.18). The fall in global crude oil prices and the easing of metal prices due to the slowdown of demand from China12, 12 This is due to China\u2019s efforts to rein in its shadow banking sector from which credit in the form of off-balance sheet lending has gone to the metal sector through wealth management products. With the tightening of credit, China\u2019s economy and its metal demand have been slowing (IMF Commodity Market Monthly, June 9, 2017). the world\u2019s biggest metals consumer, also contributed to the signi\ufb01 cant decline in domestic farm and non- farm input costs as they got passed on to inputs such as high speed diesel, aviation turbine fuel, naptha, bitumen, furnace oil and lube oils. In Q2, metal prices rose from the June trough, underpinned by expectations of strong global demand, particularly from China. However, prices moderated somewhat by end-September. Among other industrial raw materials, domestic coal prices remained range-bound while prices of other inputs such as \ufb01 bres, oil seeds and pulp either declined or moved with a softening bias; and among farm sector inputs, diesel prices declined sharply, tracking international prices. Prices of other agricultural inputs such as electricity, fertilisers, pesticides and tractors softened. Due to excess inventory, supply of fertiliser remained comfortable despite deceleration in production in Q1:2017-18 which softened prices. Tractor shipments decelerated to 8.0 per cent in Q1:2017-18 (12.1 per cent last year) largely due to destocking in the pre-GST period, with discounts imparting low momentum to prices. However, the decline in in\ufb02 ation in both farm inputs and industrial raw materials was arrested in the August prints as the prices of urea, high speed diesel and other minerals oil rose tracking international prices. Following the monsoon and the pickup in agricultural activity, demand for agricultural labourers remained strong in 2017-18. This was re\ufb02 ected in a modest increase in the rate of wage growth for rural agricultural labourers, a key determinant of farm costs (Chart II.19). In the organised sector, the decline in growth of unit employee costs in listed private sector companies in manufacturing during 2016-17 reversed to register an uptick in Q1:2017-18. However, unit employee costs for companies in the services sector continued to decline in a pattern that has set in since Q2:2016-17.13 Unit labour costs14 in the manufacturing 13 Results for Q1:2017-18 are provisional. 14 Unit labour costs is de\ufb01 ned here as the ratio of staff cost to value of production. sector continued to rise as staff cost growth outpaced the growth in value of production.15 The growth in the ratio of staff costs to value of production in the manufacturing sector accelerated modestly in the \ufb01 rst quarter of 2017-1816 after declining for the last two quarters of 2016-17 (Chart II.20). The value of production for manufacturing companies declined (probably due to de-stocking undertaken by the companies with respect to pre-GST sales) and staff costs rose marginally. The cost of raw materials, based on responses of manufacturing \ufb01 rms covered in the Reserve Bank\u2019s industrial outlook survey, remained high in Q1:2017- 18, albeit with some moderation in relation to the previous quarter, possibly re\ufb02 ecting softer commodity prices. Firms assessed that the cost of raw materials remained elevated in Q2 as well; however, their inability to increase selling prices suggests that pricing power is still weak. The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) also suggest that the cost of raw materials remained high in Q1 and Q2:2017-18, but failed to impact selling prices in view of weak pricing power. In contrast, the services PMI reported a sharp 15 Results for Q1:2017-18 are based on 363 common set of services companies and are provisional. 16 Results for Q1:2017-18 are based on 992 common set of manufacturing companies and are provisional. pickup in prices charged in Q2 \u2013 the upward revision in prices likely re\ufb02 ecting higher tax rates under GST. Globally, low in\ufb02 ation across AEs and EMEs is co- existing with a modest strengthening of demand. In India, uncertainty surrounds the path of in\ufb02 ation over the rest of the year. Overall in\ufb02 ation outcomes going forward will depend on the durability of the recent disin\ufb02 ation in food, given that base effects have turned unfavourable from August. Furthermore, there are likely headwinds from temporary price adjustments post-GST, the direct and second round impact of HRA increases (see MPR, April 2017, Chapter 1) and a recovery in demand in the second half of 2017-18 which would narrow the output gap. Consequently, the in\ufb02 ation trajectory is poised to \ufb01 rm up over the rest of the year. Finally, considerable upside risk to in\ufb02 ation stems also from the rather large scale of state level farm loan waivers and the reports of a likely \ufb01 scal stimulus (Chapter I, Box I.1). Aggregate demand has been impacted by slowing consumption demand, still subdued investment and a slump in export performance in the early months of 2017-18. Manufacturing activity, which was dragged down by one-off effects of the implementation of GST, weighed heavily on aggregate supply conditions. Notwithstanding initial deceleration, agricultural prospects remain stable and acceleration in services sector activity could impart resilience to the overall supply situation in the rest of 2017-18. Aggregate demand slackened in Q1:2017-18 in a sequence that began a year ago; yet, it surprised expectations on the downside. Restrained by languishing investment and a distinct slowdown in exports, real GDP growth fell below 6 per cent in Q1:2017-18 for the \ufb01 rst time in thirteen quarters. The deceleration in economic activity would have been more pronounced, but for the front loading of public spending which boosted government consumption and provided a cushion. Private consumption demand, still the fulcrum of overall demand in the economy, started losing momentum in Q4:2016-17 and slumped further in Q1:2017-18. Although gross \ufb01 xed capital formation (GFCF) broke out of the steady decline since the beginning of 2016-17, the uptick in Q1:2017-18 was weak and will warrant more incoming data to con\ufb01 rm if a reversal has commenced. Aggregate supply conditions were \ufb02 attened by the loss of momentum in agriculture and allied activities in spite of a sharp rise in rabi production. Industrial GVA slumped to a 20-quarter low in Q1:2017-18, impacted by one-off effects of the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), rising input costs and the deepening weakness in aggregate demand. In the services sector, however, an upturn spread to several constituent parts. Looking ahead, supply conditions are poised to receive some boost from the agricultural sector and rising expectations of a durable upswing in services. The decline in momentum in manufacturing activity remains an area of signi\ufb01 cant concern. Measured by year-on-year (y-o-y) changes in real gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices, aggregate demand decelerated to 6.1 per cent in Q4:2016-17 and further to a thirteen-quarter low of 5.7 per cent in Q1:2017-18, extending the protracted slowdown that has already spanned \ufb01 ve consecutive quarters. The loss of momentum was also evident on a seasonally adjusted basis (Chart III.1). Excluding the support from the robust growth of government \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure (GFCE), real GDP growth would have slumped to a mere 4 per cent in Q4:2016- 17 and 4.3 per cent in Q1:2017-18, respectively. Demand conditions were debilitated by a collapse in GFCF that set in from Q2:2016-17; even though GFCF recovered from contraction, its growth was feeble in Q1:2017-18. Private \ufb01 nal consumption expenditure (PFCE) slumped in Q1:2017-18 to record the slowest growth over the last six quarters. The high growth of exports in Q4:2016-17 could not be sustained and a levelling off in Q1:2017-18 appears to have prolonged into Q2 as well. Consequently, net exports depleted aggregate demand in the economy (Table III.1). Weighted contribution to growth in 2016-17 (percentage points)* Even as PFCE remained the key driver of aggregate demand in the economy, contributing 54 per cent to real GDP, a marked deceleration has characterised its evolution in Q4:2016-17 and Q1:2017-18 in comparison with the preceding three quarters (Chart III.2). High frequency indicators for urban consumption paint a mixed picture, with sales of passenger cars and international air passenger traf\ufb01 c remaining robust, but consumer durables production having contracted (Chart III.3a). Going forward, urban consumption is expected to revive, following the upward revision in house rent allowances (HRA) for central government employees as also the likely implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award at the sub- national level. High frequency indicators of rural demand, viz., growth in sales of two-wheelers and tractors, have witnessed sequential improvement in the recent months. The production of consumer non- durables, representing cash-intensive fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) demand, has, however, decelerated, though still exhibiting high growth among the components of industrial production (Chart III.3b). Retail consumption activity, re\ufb02 ected in drawals of personal loans from scheduled commercial banks (SCBs), suggests that underlying conditions are supportive of consumption demand, going forward (Chart III.4). Investment demand remained depressed, with its share in GDP declining from 34.3 per cent in 2011-12 to 29.5 per cent in 2016-17. Although GFCF exhibited a slender recovery in Q1:2017-18, the overall investment climate remains bleak. Subdued levels of investment activity were also re\ufb02 ected in the contraction of capital goods production, notwithstanding robust growth in imports of certain capital goods (III.5a). The corporate investment cycle is weighed down by excess capacity in the manufacturing sector. Capacity utilisation (CU) improved in Q4:2016-17, but it again dipped in Q1:2017-18, re\ufb02 ecting weak demand (Chart III.5b). High levels of stress in the balance sheets of banks and corporations continued to act as a drag on investment activity. Besides, households\u2019 investment in dwellings, other buildings and structures also remained subdued due to high levels of inventories of residential houses and expectations of correction in prices. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy investment proposals signi\ufb01 cantly declined in Q2: 2017-18 in terms of both numbers and value (Chart III.6a). Only 403 new projects were announced, the lowest since Q1:2004-05. The implementation of stalled projects still lacks adequate traction \u2013 there was a signi\ufb01 cant increase in stalled projects in Q1:2017-18; however, an improvement was reported in Q2:2017-18 (Chart III.6b). At the same time, anecdotal evidence suggests that awarding and construction of highway projects in the road sector have reached an all-time high and the daily additions of road construction have touched a peak. Some momentum in investment activity is also visible in sectors such as electricity transmission, roads and renewable power. Going forward, an increase in allocation of capital expenditure by 6.7 per cent in 2017-18 is expected to generate some multiplier and crowding-in effects, although a durable turnaround in the investment cycle largely hinges on a revival in private investment appetite. As stated earlier, the slowdown in aggregate demand in Q1:2017-18 was cushioned by GFCE. Following advancement of the announcement of the Union Budget, the Centre undertook massive frontloading of expenditure. The disbursement of subsidies during April-August 2017, in particular, increased sharply. BE: Budget estimates. Source: Controller General of Accounts (CGA). Consequently, revenue expenditure accounted for about 46 per cent of the budgeted expenditure (Table III.2). During Q2 so far (July-August 2017), revenue expenditure propped up GFCE with y-o-y growth of 4.4 per cent (-7.6 per cent in July-August 2016). Tax revenues (net) were higher during April-August 2017 than their levels a year ago on account of higher collections under corporate and income taxes. Receipts under customs duties, union excise duties and service tax moderated, however, mainly due to the ongoing migration of select indirect taxes to the GST (Chart III.7a). Uncertainty on the revenue front can have adverse implications for the viability of government \ufb01 nances, going ahead. The GST Council recommended a four-tier rate structure \u2013 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent \u2013 for the \ufb01 tment of all 1,211 items of goods and services, including exemptions on basic necessities (Chart III.7b). After the introduction of the GST, the total tax incidence on motor vehicles (GST plus Compensation Cess) has come down vis-a-vis the total tax incidence in the pre-GST regime. Accordingly, the GST Council has recommended that the central government moves legislative amendments for increasing the maximum ceiling of cess to be levied on motor vehicles to 25 per cent from 15 per cent. Meanwhile, the government has also indicated that it would further rationalise rates, depending on the progress of implementation. The number of new taxpayers who registered with the GSTN up to August 29, 2017 reached around 1.9 million. As per the latest information (up to September 25, 2017), revenue collections under GST for the month of August amounted to `906.7 billion as against `940.6 billion for the month of July, 2017.1 Going forward, the gains from expansion of the tax base due to introduction of the GST and improved tax compliance post-demonetisation are expected to improve tax buoyancy over the medium-term. Nevertheless, businesses have been facing some IT challenges during the initial stage of implementation which are being looked into by the GST Council. After GST implementation, exporters can avail input tax credit only after sale within the domestic tariff area or after sending their shipments outside the country. They can subsequently claim the unutilised credit as refund, a process in which their working capital gets immobilised, thereby raising their operating cost. As exporters raised concerns over blockage of refunds and working capital on account of rollout of GST, the government has decided to refund substantial amount of taxes paid by them to provide immediate relief. In view of the dif\ufb01 culties being faced by taxpayers in \ufb01 ling returns, the dates for \ufb01 ling various GSTR have been extended. Furthermore, comprehending GST provisions and their impact on business along with the requirements for GST-compliance is still premature. Moreover, provisions for anti-pro\ufb01 teering as well as the now-deferred e-way bill which tracks consignments across states are unclear. After the \ufb01 tment committee observed anomalies in GST levied on 40 items, the GST Council has lowered taxes on these products. In view of the above, it may be challenging to realise the projected tax revenues in the Union Budget 2017-18. The Centre\u2019s borrowing programme was conducted as per the planned issuance schedule within the overall contour of its debt management strategy. Following the strategy of front loading of issuances, the central government completed 64.1 per cent (58.6 per cent in corresponding period of 2016-17) of its budgeted gross borrowings (`5,800 billion) by September 2017 (Table III.3). The spate of increased borrowing by the the \ufb01 nite pool of investible resources and crowd out private investment. Consolidated state \ufb01 nances are budgeted to improve in 2017-18 on account of a lower gross \ufb01 scal de\ufb01 cit- GDP ratio. While the capital expenditure-GDP ratio is budgeted to be lower in 2017-18 than in the previous year, capital outlay is projected to remain unchanged, which augurs well for the quality of expenditure. State \ufb01 nances, however, are likely to come under stress during 2017-18 from farm loan waivers announced during the year so far, which are estimated at around 0.5 per cent of GDP, and partial implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations. This, in turn, has to be \ufb01 nanced by additional market borrowings which push up interest rates, not just for damage could be that private borrowers are crowded out as the cost of borrowing rises. Even if the loan waiver is accommodated within budgetary provisions, it may force cutbacks in other heads of expenditure. Experience has shown that the most vulnerable category is capital expenditure. Illustratively, Uttar Pradesh, which presented its budget after the announcement of the loan waiver, has built in a decline On the other hand, Maharashtra, which presented its budget before the announcement, projected a decline of around 4.2 per cent in capital expenditure. This, in turn, might entail deterioration in the quality implications for of expenditure with attendant productivity. With import growth far outpacing that of exports, the contribution of net external demand to GDP turned negative in Q1:2017-18, as in the preceding quarter. The slowdown in exports in Q1: 2017-18 was broad- based and encompassed oil and non-oil segments accounting for 74 per cent of the export basket. During July 2017, export growth slowed further despite a sharp increase in oil exports, but revived in August 2017 largely due to an increase in engineering goods, electronic goods and drugs and pharmaceuticals exports. Merchandise import growth accelerated in Q1:2017-18, taking the trade de\ufb01 cit to its highest level since Q2:2013-14, despite crude oil prices being half the level that prevailed in 2013-14 (Chart III.8a). In July-August too, the merchandise trade de\ufb01 cit expanded unrelentingly on the back of sustained import demand. Notwithstanding declining oil import volumes, gold imports grew strongly in Q1:2017-18 in anticipation of GST implementation. However, they moderated sequentially during June-August 2017 as stockpiling eased, while remaining high on a y-o-y basis (Chart III.8b). Among non-oil non-gold imports, which have been growing in double digits since Q4:2016-17, pearls Net services receipts increased by 15.7 per cent on a y-o-y basis during Q1: 2017-18 largely driven by a rise in net earnings from travel, construction and other business services. While out\ufb02 ows of primary income remain a drag on the current account de\ufb01 cit (CAD), a modest rise in secondary income, primarily in the form of workers\u2019 remittances, provided a partial offset. and precious stones, electronics goods, coal and other goods contributed sizably, underlining the role of international commodity prices and increased domestic demand for electric, construction and dairy machinery even as a decline in imports of transport equipment coincided with an increase in domestic production (Chart III.9). While there has been a contraction in domestic production of capital goods, imports of capital goods, except transport equipment, gradually increased during April-August 2017. Similarly, higher imports of sugar re\ufb02 ected domestic consumption exceeding production in 2016-17. Both net FDI and net FPI \ufb02 ows to India rose during Q1:2017-18 over their levels a year ago, attesting to the attractiveness of the Indian economy as an investment destination. External commercial borrowings (ECBs) in\ufb02 ows also picked up modestly on the back of a sharp increase in issuance of rupee denominated bonds. In contrast, net accretion to NRI deposits declined marginally, re\ufb02 ecting lower in\ufb02 ows into Non-Resident External (NRE) rupee accounts. Re\ufb02 ecting external sector resilience, foreign exchange reserves reached a level of US$ 399.7 billion on September 29, 2017 equivalent to 11.5 months of imports. 2 The cyclical slowdown that set in at the beginning of 2016-17 pulled the growth of output measured by gross value added (GVA) at basic prices down to 5.6 per cent in Q1:2017-18, \ufb02 at at the level of the preceding quarter (Table III.4). Underlying this subdued performance was the depressed state of industrial activity, particularly manufacturing. Although agricultural and allied 2 Calculated using imports of four quarters up to June 2017. activities also decelerated sequentially from Q3:2016- 17, they were in alignment with the typical outturn in the \ufb01 rst quarter of the year. Services sector activity, however, posted a strong performance, dispelling the slack that had manifested itself through 2016- by continuing strong growth in public administration, constituent of the services sector which has been buoyed by frontloading of Government expenditure in Q1:2017-18. Excluding this component, the GVA growth would have slipped to 5 per cent in Q1:2017- 18 (Chart III.10). However, seasonally adjusted q-o-q annualised GVA growth suggests a modest strengthening of momentum in Q1:2017-18 vis-\u00e0-vis Q4:2016-17 (Chart III.11). The April MPR had projected GVA growth of 6.7 per cent for Q1:2017-18. The actual outcome undershot this projection by more than a full percentage point, indicative of the larger than expected loss of momentum III.12). The unexpected moderation in allied activities weighed heavily on the rate of growth of agricultural sector. In addition, the deceleration in the manufacturing sector re\ufb02 ected uncertainties surrounding GST implementation and higher than expected rise in input costs. Agriculture and allied activities recorded a signi\ufb01 cant from Q4:2016-17, deceleration notwithstanding the jump of 8.5 per cent in rabi foodgrain production, the highest growth recorded in the last 13 years. Moreover, the area under horticulture grew by 2.6 per cent in 2016-17 from a year ago, while production increased by 4.8 per cent, reaching a record of 300 million tonnes. The moderation in agricultural GVA growth in relation to the preceding quarters mainly re\ufb02 ects the slowdown in \u2018livestock products, forestry and \ufb01 sheries\u2019. South-west monsoon rainfall was higher than the long period average (LPA) till the fourth week of July, but turned signi\ufb01 cantly weak thereafter (Chart III.13). As of September 30, 2017, out of the 36 sub-divisions in the country, 30 divisions received excess/normal rainfall, while the remaining divisions (east and west UP, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Punjab, east MP and Vidarbha), covering 17 per cent of the sub-divisional area of the country, received de\ufb01 cient rainfall. In terms of the production weighted rainfall index (PRN), rainfall was lower than the previous year by 5 per cent, resulting in contraction in the area sown under key crops (Chart III.14). Although kharif sowing started on a high note, the momentum slowed down in August due to a lull in the south-west monsoon and lower than expected increase in MSPs (Table III.5) and decline in wholesale prices of major food items across mandis on account of the bumper harvest. The latest data suggest that sowing picked up again in September; however, kharif sowing for the year as a whole has remained lower than last year\u2019s acreage (Chart III.15). In terms of crops, sown area was lower in the case of rice, coarse cereals, oilseeds pulses and jute and mesta, but it was higher in the case of sugarcane and cotton (Chart III.16). According to the \ufb01 rst advance estimate (AE), the production of kharif foodgrains for 2017-18 at 134.7 million tonnes was 2.8 per cent lower than last year (4th AE). Water storage levels in 91 reservoirs across the country were lower at 66 per cent of the full reservoir level (74 per cent last year) as on September 28, 2017. Apart from the northern region, reservoirs in all other regions received less water than in the corresponding period last year. This could pose a challenge to the attainment of the crop production target set at 274.6 million tonnes for 2017-18. Industrial GVA growth dipped to 1.5 per cent in Q1 of 2017-18 \u2013 the lowest in the last 20 quarters, mainly due to GST-related uncertainties. The index of industrial production (IIP) exhibited a broad-based deceleration in Q1. Large negative production effects partly offset positive base effects, especially in April and July (Chart III.17a). On a use-based analysis, the output of both capital goods and consumer durables contracted, highlighting weak investment appetite and slowing consumption demand. In terms of weighted contributions, the slowdown was led by capital goods, followed by intermediate goods (Chart III.17b). Acceleration in consumer non-durables was driven mainly by the contribution of a single item, viz., digestive enzymes and antacids (DEA); excluding this component, the overall index would have contracted by 0.2 per cent in July 2017 as compared with the growth of 2.2 per cent in July 2016 (Chart III.18a). Of the 23 industry groups that form the manufacturing sector, production in 15 industries contracted during July 2017. The strong performance in a few industries such as pharmaceuticals and transport equipment was pulled down by a broad-based slowdown in other industries, most notably electrical equipment (Chart III.18b). The sharp deceleration in manufacturing in Q1:2017- 18 was due to a combination of factors playing out simultaneously. While the uncertainties relating to GST implementation affected overall business sentiment, value added declined as sales decelerated and expenditure accelerated (Chart III.19). The mining and quarrying segment, which showed some signs of revival in the second half of 2016-17, sank back again to contraction mode in Q1:2017- 18. Although natural gas production has sustained the revival that set in from the second half of the previous year, contraction in crude oil production and subdued coal production pulled down mining output. Contraction in coal production was on account of lower demand for electricity generation, which has undergone signi\ufb01 cant transformation in the recent period. While renewable energy has made rapid strides due to falling costs and Government\u2019s incentives, reports suggest that some of these projects are facing challenges in terms of collapse in prices resulting in low tariffs/renegotiations of tariffs, weak demand and exhausted tax bene\ufb01 ts. These factors have raised concerns about the viability of such projects. Going forward, this segment may remain subdued until there is a signi\ufb01 cant pick-up in demand. The slowdown lukewarm performance of eight core industries, except natural gas, coal and electricity. Contraction in cement, fertilisers and crude oil accentuated the overall slowdown. Early indicators for 2017-18 point to subdued industrial activity. The 79th round of the IIP mirrored the Reserve Bank\u2019s Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS) signaled subdued demand conditions in Q2:2017-18. The services sector, which decelerated sequentially through 2016-17, recorded a signi\ufb01 cant improvement in Q1:2017-18 (7.8 per cent, up from 5.7 per cent in Q4:2016-17), driven mainly by trade, hotels, transport and communication as well as public administration, defence and other services. Financial, real and improvement professional services also showed in Q1:2017-18. Although the construction sector switched from contraction mode in Q4:2016-17 into expansion, it may be too early to conclude that the upturn is durable (Chart III.20). In the housing sector, new units launched have slowed down although units sold have shown an uptick in some cities in recent quarters (Chart III.21a and b). This is expected to continue as the industry gears up for further consolidation, and as greater clarity on the implementation of Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA) across States emerges. With inventories, property prices showed a correction in Q4:2016-17 in major cities (Chart III.22a). Cement production \u2013 an indicator of construction activity \u2013 is still in contraction mode, while steel consumption improved in recent months (Chart III.22b). Activity in trade, hotels, transport and communication, which was affected post-demonetisation, bounced back to register a \ufb01 ve-quarter high growth of 11.1 per cent in Q1:2017-18. Indirect taxes, a major indicator of activity of this segment, grew by 14 per cent in Q1:2017-18. Most of the lead indicators of activity in this segment, viz., foreign tourist arrivals, traf\ufb01 c, international passenger and air railway traf\ufb01 c, and telephone subscribers showed an uptick in recent months. Financial, real estate and professional services also accelerated in Q1:2017-18, partly re\ufb02 ecting robust value addition by information technology companies in the professional services segment. The \ufb01 nancial sector\u2019s growth decelerated in the recent period, mirrored in weak growth in aggregate deposits and bank credit. Notwithstanding low credit growth, high deposit growth in the second half of 2016-17 had helped in propping up activity in this sub-sector, maintaining the weighted average of the two. In Q1:2017-18, however, both credit growth and deposit growth declined, pulling down the sub-sectoral activity (Chart III.23). As in the previous quarter, public administration, defence and other services bene\ufb01 tted from higher revenue expenditure of the Centre in Q1 and continued to provide support to GVA growth (Chart III.24). The output gap measured by the deviation of actual output from its potential level and expressed as a percentage of potential output, is a gauge of demand conditions. Despite its usefulness as a summary measure of the cyclical component of aggregate demand, in\ufb01 rmities arise from the fact that the output gap is unobservable and needs to be estimated from the data. As different \ufb01 ltering techniques are highly sensitive to the choice of period, methodology and the availability of data, a pragmatic approach is followed by staff that involves various methodologies including univariate \ufb01 lters like Baxter-King (BK), Hodrick\u2013Prescott (HP) and Christiano- Fitzgerald (CF), Multivariate Kalman \ufb01 lters (MVKF) and production functions. A \ufb01 nance adjusted measure of the output gap, which controls for the imbalances emanating from the \ufb01 nancial sector, has also been introduced in this MPR (Box III.1). All these output gap measures are aggregated by using principal component analysis in order to construct a composite The estimation of potential output - the level of output that an economy can produce sustainably over the medium-term consistent with low and stable in\ufb02 ation \u2013 enables an assessment of the output gap as the deviation of actual output from this potential level. Conventional estimates of the output gap largely ignore the role of \ufb01 nancial sector (Borio et al., 2016). The pre- global \ufb01 nancial crisis (GFC) period was characterised by high output growth, benign in\ufb02 ation and \ufb01 nancial sector imbalances emanating from rapid growth in credit and asset prices, which eventually culminated in the GFC in 2008. It is plausible for in\ufb02 ation to remain low and stable in times when output growth is on an unsustainable path due to buildup of imbalances in \ufb01 nancial sector. Taking these into consideration Borio et al. (2016) present an alternate measure of the output gap \u2013 \u201c\ufb01 nance neutral output gap\u201d \u2013 which incorporates the role of \ufb01 nancial sector variables in the evolution of economic cycles. India also recorded high credit and asset prices growth along with rising output growth and moderately low in\ufb02 ation in the pre-GFC period. For instance, during 2002-03 to 2007-08 the average annual growth in non- food credit and annual return on assets (measured by the Sensex) were 27 per cent and 32 per cent, respectively, while the CPI in\ufb02 ation was, on an average, about 5 per cent. Output growth was close to double digits during 2005-06 to 2007-08 (Chart a). cycles, real credit growth and real asset price growth were included along with the real policy rate to estimate the output gap in a semi-structural multivariate Kalman \ufb01 lter framework. The \ufb01 nance neutral output gap was estimated using quarterly data from Q1:2006-07 to Q1:2017-18 by the quasi maximum likelihood method on the following state space model: denote GVA at basic prices and potential output respectively (both in log term). Gt represents growth rate of potential output and is a vector of explanatory variables \u2013 real policy rate, real credit growth and real asset price returns with appropriately chosen lags3 ; each represent normally and independently distributed error terms. The set of equations (1) to (3) represents an approximation of economic theory, incorporating \ufb01 nancial sector developments. The output gap obtained by this methodology remained mostly negative over the last two years. In 2015-16 and the \ufb01 rst half of 2016-17, the \ufb01 nance neutral output gap was lower relative to the output gap estimated from a one sided Hodrick\u2013Prescott \ufb01 lter. However, the two output gap measures have converged in recent quarters (Chart b). represents output gap whereas and Guided by empirical evidence of a signi\ufb01 cant relationship between \ufb01 nancial factors and business 3 Lags are chosen based on the univariate analysis, cross correlations and OLS regression, while ensuring convergence of the optimisation algorithm. The historical decomposition of the output gap, portraying the contribution of various factors on its evolution, suggests that \ufb01 nancial factors have been contributing negatively to the output gap since 2012-13 (Rath et.al, 2017) (Chart c). High in\ufb02 ation and low real interest rates during the period 2010-13 contributed positively to the output gap. More recently, subdued credit growth has contributed negatively to demand conditions. measure (Chart III.25 a and b). This measure indicates that the output gap has been negative since Q3:2016-17. Early indicators for Q2:2017-18 point to subdued industrial activity, in particular in the manufacturing sector. While many high frequency services sector improvement, some indicators show signs of Rath, D.P., Mitra, P. and John, J. (2017), \u201cA Measure of Finance-Neutral Output Gap for India\u201d, RBI Working Paper Series, WPS (DEPR): 03 / 2017. others such as port traf\ufb01 c and domestic air freight traf\ufb01 c still show tepid growth. The Government\u2019s initiatives in essential infrastructure, affordable housing, and transparency through the real estate regulatory act should be positive for construction activity, if they are implemented with speed and ef\ufb01 ciency. The GST is likely to result in greater formalisation of the economy in due course as \ufb01 rms register to receive improved input tax credits even though teething problems remain a challenge at the current juncture. Improved prospects for rural incomes during 2017-18, higher MSPs, and large budgetary allocations for MGNREGA could in rural demand. Household consumption demand in urban areas may get a boost from the upward revision in HRA for government employees and implementation of the 7th CPC announced by States. The key to achieving a higher growth trajectory lies, however, in reviving investment activity. Major structural reforms already initiated, including the GST, enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), the likely recapitalisation of public sector banks and speedy resolution of stressed assets augur well for the outlook. Financial market conditions in the first half of 2017-18 remained stable, with the weighted average call money rate (WACR) moving progressively closer to the policy repo rate, stock markets scaling new highs, bond yields oscillating with fluctuations in inflation readings and the foreign exchange market buoyed by large portfolio flows. Credit offtake from risk-averse banks remained low, though monetary policy transmission strengthened for new loans in conditions of sizable surplus liquidity. Through the \ufb01rst half of 2017-18, global \ufb01nancial markets were lifted by record low volatility, declining credit spreads and stretched market valuations, as concerns about the pace of re\ufb02ation and normalisation of monetary policy in advanced economies (AEs) receded. Equity markets scaled new peaks relative to earnings, propelled by a renewed reach for returns. Bond yields, which had \ufb01rmed up till early 2017, reversed course from April on softer than expected commodity prices and expectations of a more relaxed pace of monetary policy normalisation in the US on easing in\ufb02ation risks. The US dollar depreciated against major currencies, partly correcting for the upside it had gained post-Presidential elections in the US. Geopolitical risks, however, sparked bouts of volatility in August. Global \ufb01nancial markets remained largely resilient to the September communication of the Federal Reserve on its balance sheet normalisation. Financial markets in emerging market economies (EMEs) remained tranquil, with equity markets surging and the return of large portfolio \ufb02ows exerting appreciation pressures on their currencies. Domestic \ufb01nancial markets were in\ufb02uenced by a variety of factors: the dramatic swings in in\ufb02ation; surplus liquidity conditions; the implementation of GST; and remonetisation. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 moved closer to the policy repo rate, notwithstanding persistent surplus liquidity conditions. Equity markets were buoyed to new peaks by a surge in investment by mutual funds, even as foreign portfolio investment reached close to exhausting macro-prudential limits in some debt markets. Corporate bond yields softened, tracking G-sec yields and moderation in credit spreads. The exchange rate of the rupee moved in a narrow range, with an appreciating bias on the back of waves of portfolio \ufb02ows. Markets were impacted in September by the announcement of the Fed that it will initiate balance sheet normalisation in October and certain domestic developments, in particular, higher in\ufb02ation print and concerns about the rise in the \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit, leading to hardening of yields, correction in stock prices and depreciation of the rupee. Deposit rates declined as banks were \ufb02ush with liquidity. Credit \ufb02ows from banks improved modestly, though still hamstrung by stressed assets induced deleveraging and weak investment demand. A cumulative 200 basis points (bps) cut in the repo rate since January 2015 has been, by and large, transmitted to lending rates on new loans; however, transmission to past loans remains incomplete. Different market segments in the domestic \ufb01nancial system responded variedly to domestic cues, with the impact of global spillovers remaining relatively contained until mid-September. Excess liquidity in money markets, high valuations in the bond and equity markets and an upside tone in the forex market co-existed with subdued activity in the credit market in the \ufb01rst half of 2017-18. IV.1.1 Money Market: A large liquidity overhang, fuelled mainly by the front-loading of government spend, which necessitated frequent recourse to ways and means advances (WMAs) and overdrafts (ODs) over the greater part of this period, imparted a downside bias to overnight money market rates in H1 of 2017-18. While the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor was narrowed from +/- 50 bps to +/- 25 bps in April 2017, active liquidity operations (described in Section IV.3) progressively whittled away at the overhang and narrowed the spread between the WACR and the policy rate from 31 bps in April to 13 bps in September (Charts IV.1 and IV.2). In combination with the liquidity impact of the RBI\u2019s forex operations and scheduled redemptions of G-secs, these autonomous \ufb02ows more than offset the liquidity tightening impact of remonetisation. Money market rates adjusted seamlessly to the narrowing of the LAF corridor. Virtually no effect was observed on volumes traded in the call money market (Charts IV.3 and IV.4). Empirical evidence suggests that volatility in the WACR has a relatively muted role in monetary policy transmission (Box IV.1). Other money market rates traded in alignment with the WACR (Chart IV.5). In view of comfortable access to liquidity and weak demand for credit, banks reduced their recourse to certi\ufb01cates of deposit (CDs). Fresh issuances of CDs were lower at `1,302 billion during reading in May 2017, money market rates traded with High volatility in the operating target can potentially dampen transmission of monetary policy. Changes in long-term interest rates, which are vital to monetary policy transmission for in\ufb02 uencing aggregate demand, are conditioned by the expected path of future short- term rates and variations in the term premium. Higher volatility in overnight rates can potentially spillover into the term premium, thereby in\ufb02 uencing \u201cequilibrium levels of nominal and real long-term rates and disturbing the transmission mechanism of monetary policy impulses\u201d (Colarossi and Zaghini, 2009). In the empirical literature, the transmission of volatility from the overnight interest rate along the yield curve is typically validated by the statistical signi\ufb01 cance of conditional volatility relating the overnight rate in variants of generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) speci\ufb01 cations. Country experiences yield scant evidence of transmission of volatility from the overnight rate. Pro-active liquidity management and greater transparency along with more effective communication may help in better anchoring of market expectations (Osborne, 2016). GARCH term), and volatility observed in the previous period (the ARCH term), which is augmented to capture the impact of dummies mentioned earlier. The results suggest that the volatility in the WACR is persistent (Table IV.B.1). With a view to studying the impact of conditional volatility of the WACR \u2013 the operating target of monetary policy in India \u2013 on interest rates across the term structure, the following GARCH (1,1) mean and volatility equations were speci\ufb01 ed. where denotes the daily WACR, ot is the policy repo rate, liqt is the daily net LAF position and represents daily change in respective variables. The impact of speci\ufb01 c developments on the WACR \u2013 such as the taper tantrum, demonetisation, year-end liquidity effects, and fortnightly reserve maintenance patterns of banks \u2013 are controlled for through the use of dummy variables represented by DXt. The conditional variance equation (2) helps identify the time-varying volatility of the residuals generated from the mean equation (1). is expressed as a function of the weighted average of its long-term average (the constant term), the last period forecast variance (the Conditional volatility of the WACR extracted from equations (1) and (2) is then used as an explicit determinant of daily change in other interest rates (i.e., nominal yield on government paper of 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month, 2-year and 10-year maturities), in their respective mean and volatility equations, while retaining the same structural speci\ufb01 cations as in equations 1 and 2. The coef\ufb01 cients of conditional volatility of WACR in the mean and variance equations of other interest rates are reported in Table IV.B.2. Two inferences could be derived from these results: (a) WACR volatility is not a statistically signi\ufb01 cant determinant of the mean values of daily changes in other interest rates across the yield curve; and (b) even while WACR volatility has a statistically signi\ufb01 cant conditioning in\ufb02 uence on the volatility of other interest rates, particularly up to one year tenor, the values of the relevant coef\ufb01 cients are too small to impact the transmission of monetary policy. A one percentage point increase in volatility of the WACR is estimated to increase the volatility of short-term yields by about 0.02 to 0.08 bps, while the impact on volatility of longer-term yields is even more negligible. These \ufb01 ndings suggest that occasional surges in volatility triggered by speci\ufb01 c developments are likely anticipated and contained quickly through proactive liquidity management, which helps avert any potential impediments to the transmission of monetary policy. declined by 15 bps, 20 bps and 20 bps, respectively. After the repo rate was cut in August 2017, the 3-month CD and 91-day T-Bill rates declined by about 10 bps and 5 bps, respectively, while the 3-month CP rate inched up by about 4 bps, indicating that markets had already priced in a repo rate cut. yields hardened thereafter reacting to the higher- communication on September 20, 2017 signalling one IV.1.2 Government Securities (G-sec) Market: G-sec yields generally softened during the most part of H1 of 2017-18, driven by lower in\ufb02ation data, sustained domestic \ufb01scal de\ufb01cit due to a possible \ufb01scal stimulus to boost the economy also impacted yields. G-sec yields hardened by 12 bps in early April in anticipation of oversupply of paper because of the likely use of market stabilisation scheme (MSS) and open market operations (OMOs) by the RBI to absorb surplus liquidity. Two developments in the month of May, however, contributed to considerable softening of yields (Chart IV.7). First, a new benchmark Government of India Security of 10-year tenor (NI GS 2027) was auctioned on May 12, 2017 at a cut-off of 6.79 per cent, evincing an enthusiastic bid-cover ratio of 6.61. Second, the CSO\u2019s May 12 release on CPI \u2013 coinciding with the date of auction of the new benchmark \u2013 showed headline in\ufb02ation softening in April 2017. In June, yields softened even further in response to headline in\ufb02ation for May 2017 printing lower. In Q2, CPI in\ufb02ation\u2019s historic low reading for June 2017 at 1.5 per cent combined with the normal progress of the monsoon further boosted sentiment in the G-sec market. With the July CPI in\ufb02ation moving up, however, expectations reversed and yields commenced hardening in August, notwithstanding the 25 bps cut in the repo rate. Notably, the normalisation of the US monetary policy during H1 of 2017 (on March 15 and on June 14) did not have much in\ufb02uence on domestic yields. However, G-sec yields hardened thereafter on the faster-than-expected rise in August headline in\ufb02ation, the prospect of a \ufb01scal stimulus in India, and the Fed communication of September 20, 2017, as mentioned earlier. Persisting positive yield differentials with the rest of the world and the stable exchange rate of the rupee created congenial conditions for foreign portfolio in\ufb02ows. Net foreign portfolio investment in G-secs was `617 billion (including investment in state development loans of `26.2 billion) during H1, resulting in 99 per cent of the limit for FPI investment in G-secs being utilised1. FPIs continued to be net buyers in the debt market in every month during H1 (Chart IV.8). In the short end of the G-sec market, the impact of the larger supply of paper \u2013 issuances of T-Bills of `1 trillion under the MSS and of cash management bills (CMBs) cumulatively aggregating to `2.5 trillion \u2013 was re\ufb02ected in the hardening of T-Bills rates during H1 (Chart IV.9). Issuances of state development loans (SDLs) remained subdued in Q1 of 2017-18, but picked up in Q2. The spread of SDLs\u2019 cut-off over the 10-year G-sec remained in the range of 74-87 bps in September 2017 1 On September 28, 2017, the limits for FPI investment in G-secs and SDLs for the October-December quarter were increased by `80 billion and `62 billion, respectively. as compared with 77-81 bps in April 2017 (Chart IV.10). In H1 of 2017-18, there were no issuances of Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) bonds in contrast to 2016-17 when thirteen States issued UDAY bonds of `1,091 billion as against `990 billion issued by eight States in the previous year2. The total secondary market trading volume (face value) of UDAY bonds 2 The spread on UDAY bonds during 2016-17 declined to 35-75 bps over the corresponding tenor/10-year FIMMDA G-sec yield as compared with a \ufb01 xed spread of 75 bps in 2015-16. Approximately 45 per cent of total UDAY bond issuances in 2016-17 were concentrated in Q4. The large volume of SDL issuances, including UDAY, was one of the major factors that resulted in a widening of weighted average spread on SDLs to 83 bps in Q4 of 2016-17. during H1 of 2017-18 (up to September 29, 2017) was `626 billion. There is no signi\ufb01cant relationship between the borrowing spreads on SDLs and States\u2019 \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits and debt positions. The inter-State spread was, on average, within 9 bps during H1 of 2017-18 as against 7 bps in 2016-17 and 2015-16. Cost considerations have drastically reduced the dependence of State Governments on the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF). Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission (FC), all States (barring four3) have been allowed to be excluded from the NSSF \ufb01nancing facility beginning 2016-17. The share of market borrowings, which can be raised at relatively lower costs, particularly when markets do not differentiate between States on the basis of their respective \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits and debt, has increased, including for discharging past NSSF liabilities. IV.1.3 Corporate Bond Market: Corporate bond yields softened during H1 of 2017-18, tracking the decline in G-sec yields (Chart IV.11a). The decline in 5-year AAA corporate yield was, however, interspersed with occasional spikes at the end of June and in early-July. The spread of 5-year AAA rated corporate bonds over 5-year G-secs declined by 56 bps, possibly re\ufb02ecting improvement in overall credit risk perceptions on expectation of faster resolution of stressed assets under the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance promulgated on May 4, 2017. The average daily turnover in the corporate bond market increased sharply to `73.2 billion during April-August 2017 from `47.5 billion during the corresponding period of last year. Resources mobilised through issuances of corporate bonds in the primary market increased by 7.1 per cent to `2,770 billion during April-August 2017 from `2,588 billion a year ago. Of the total resources mobilised from the private corporate bond market, private placements constituted 98.6 per cent (Chart IV.11b). Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in corporate bonds increased to `2.42 trillion as on September 28, 2017 from `1.86 trillion at end-March 2017. As a result, the utilisation of the approved limit rose to 99.2 per cent from about 76 per cent at end-March 2017. On September 22, 2017, the Reserve Bank announced the removal of Masala bonds or rupee denominated bonds issued overseas from the corporate bond investment limit effective October 3, 2017. This will release additional space for investment by FPIs in corporate bonds. The total investment in Masala bonds amounted to `440 billion at end-September 2017. The stable exchange rate of the rupee, uncertainty around policies of the US administration, and market expectations of a more gradual Fed normalisation increased the attractiveness of Indian bonds. IV.1.4 Stock Market: The equity market remained buoyant through the greater part of H1 of 2017-18, with the BSE Sensex crossing the 32,000 mark on July 13, 2017 and the NSE Nifty crossing the 10,000 mark on July 26, 2017. Upbeat market sentiment appeared impervious to the perception of overvaluation in terms of a high price to earnings ratio (about 23.4) at end- September 2017 relative to AEs (21.0) and EMEs (15.8). Market ebullience was largely generated by domestic factors: expectations of reform intensi\ufb01cation after introduction of the GST; the resolution of bank stressed assets and smooth progress of the insolvency regime; satisfactory monsoon; and lower in\ufb02ation in May and June. The BSE Sensex gained 5.6 per cent during H1 of 2017-18 (Chart IV.12a). Net buying by domestic institutional investors, particularly by mutual funds, overwhelmed volatile foreign portfolio \ufb02ows and sustained the rally (Chart IV.12b). After a late April recovery from downside global cues and sporadic volatility in June, stock markets surged in July 2017, with both the BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty touching historic highs. In August 2017, markets corrected somewhat amidst volatility following the SEBI\u2019s directions to stock exchanges to ban shell companies, concerns over high valuations, lower than expected corporate earnings results for Q1 of 2017- 18, downside risks to growth in 2017-18, uncertainty over the GST rollout, net selling by foreign portfolio investors and global sell-offs over geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula. Reduction in deposit interest rates by banks and the decline in gold prices enhanced the relative attractiveness of mutual fund schemes. Resources mobilised under equity oriented schemes during April-August 2017 were higher at `614 billion than `185 billion during the corresponding period last year. Mutual funds are emerging as a counterweight to foreign institutional investors in the equity market. Net investment by mutual funds in equity during April-September 2017 was at `752.7 billion as against out\ufb02ows of `87.7 billion by foreign portfolio investors. The post-demonetisation shift in the composition of \ufb01nancial saving of households into \ufb01nancial assets expanded assets under management (AUM) of mutual funds sizably from about `17.5 trillion at end-March 2017 to a record of `20.6 trillion at end-August 2017 as against assets under custody of FPIs of `30.4 trillion. In the primary market, resources mobilised through public issues of equity (initial public offers and rights issues) increased by 9.0 per cent during April- August 2017 over the corresponding period a year ago. Companies mobilised a total of `104.7 billion through 53 initial public offer (IPO) issues of which 41 were listed on the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) platform of the BSE and the NSE. Financial entities accounted for 32.8 per cent of the total resources mobilised through public issues of equity. Among non-\ufb01nancial entities, the healthcare sector raised the largest amount of `19.5 billion, accounting for 26.1 per cent of the total, followed by engineering (20.1 per cent) and consumer service (10.6 per cent) sectors. The IPOs in the pipeline suggest that the upbeat primary market conditions are likely to continue in the short run. IV.1.5 Foreign Exchange Market: The rupee traded with an appreciating bias against the US dollar, strengthening by around 4 per cent in H1 of 2017-18 after six consecutive years of depreciation. A weaker US dollar and strong in\ufb02ows drawn in by the resilience of macro fundamentals, especially the narrowing of in\ufb02ation differentials, also provided sustained upside to the rupee, as in the case of the EME currencies (Chart IV.13). Expectations of bolder reforms after the State election results, the narrowing of the current account de\ufb01cit in 2016-17 \u2013 in its July 2017 External Sector Report, the IMF assessed India\u2019s external positions as \u201cbroadly in line\u201d with medium-term fundamentals \u2013 and the implementation of the GST combined to lend an upside bias to the rupee. Notably, exchange rate volatility declined considerably: the coef\ufb01cient of variation4 of the INR/USD exchange rate at 0.6 per cent during the \ufb01rst half of 2017-18 was lowest since 2005-06. In terms of both the 36-currency nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and the real effective exchange rate (REER), the rupee depreciated by 0.7 per cent and 0.6 per cent, respectively, between September 2017 and March 2017 (Table IV.1). Currencies of several major AEs and EMEs have appreciated against the US dollar since January 2017, largely re\ufb02ecting the weakness of the US dollar, with the US dollar index depreciating by 8.9 per cent over end-December 2016 (Chart IV.14). IV.1.6 Credit Market: In the credit market, activity remained subdued although non-food credit staged a modest recovery during H1 of 2017-18, after a sharp deceleration in the preceding six months (Chart IV.15). A part of the credit slowdown in H2 of 2016-17 was overstated by the swapping of loans into UDAY bonds and the use of demonetised currency notes for repaying bank loans. As stated in the MPR of April 2017, stressed assets \u2013 gross NPAs of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) at 10.3 per cent of total advances and the 4 The coef\ufb01 cient of variation (CV) is a standardised measure of dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution and can be calculated as a ratio of standard deviation to the mean. stressed advances ratio at 12.6 per cent as on June 30, 2017 \u2013 and capital constraints, particularly in public sector banks, have hindered a robust revival in the \ufb02ow of bank credit. The large divergence in credit growth across bank groups is striking, suggesting the role of several factors at play from both demand side and supply side (Chart IV.16). The adverse impact of stressed assets in the banking system is also visible in the sectoral deployment of credit (Chart IV.17). Industry has the largest share of stressed assets in the banking system and, correspondingly, credit growth to industry remains in contraction mode. Within industry, sectors facing acute stress are also experiencing the largest declines in bank credit exposure, re\ufb02ecting stepped-up efforts to deleverage and free up balance sheets from impairment (Chart IV.18). Banks also extend \ufb01nance to the commercial sector of the economy by way of non-SLR investments, mainly in the form of investment in CPs and bonds/shares/ debentures issued by non-\ufb01nancial corporates. In H1 of 2017-18, however, banks\u2019 non-SLR investment was lower than in previous years (Chart IV.19). With the gradual reduction in surplus liquidity in the system and the pick-up in credit growth, the level of excess maintenance under the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) by the banking system declined from a high of 11.8 per cent in December 2016 to 9.2 per cent by June 2017 (Chart IV.20). The prescribed SLR was reduced by 50 bps to 20.0 per cent of NDTL effective the fortnight beginning June 24, 2017, aimed at freeing up resources of banks for lending to productive sectors of the economy. After the reduction in the SLR, however, excess SLR increased in July to 9.8 per cent and further to 10.3 per cent in August, re\ufb02ecting banks\u2019 reluctance to lend in the face of their asset quality concerns and capital constraints, lacklustre investment demand and stalled progress in unlocking stranded investment. The increase in excess SLR occurred across bank groups, but was the sharpest for foreign banks. Private banks, which have the lowest excess SLR among SCBs, also registered a sharp increase in August to 5.9 per cent of NDTL. High excess SLR has enabled banks to comfortably meet the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) norms, relative to their counterparts in other jurisdictions. The total \ufb02ow of \ufb01nancial resources to the commercial sector was much higher during H1 of 2017-18 than in the comparable period of last year5, with both bank and non-bank funding being higher (Chart IV.21). Among non-bank sources of funding, the increase was mainly on account of foreign sources, particularly FDI. 5 Financial year variations for banking aggregates are computed over the last reporting Friday of the previous \ufb01 nancial year. In the case of 2017-18, however, the last reporting Friday of the previous year was March 31, 2017, which was also the balance sheet date. The \ufb01 nancial year \ufb02 ow from the banking sector has therefore been computed from the penultimate reporting Friday of 2016-17. This avoids the impact of year-end balance sheet adjustments for computing the credit \ufb02 ows in 2017-18. If credit \ufb02 ows are computed from March 31, 2017, they will typically be negative for almost the entire H1. Among domestic non-bank sources, credit extended by housing \ufb01nance companies and NBFCs increased (Table IV.2). 3 Net issuance of CPs subscribed regulated AIFIs 1 External commercial borrowings / FCCB $ #: Up to June 2017 $: Up to July 2017.

MCLR was introduced on April 1, 2016. Data on Median Term Deposit Rate, WADTDR and WALR on outstanding and fresh rupee loans pertain to August 2017. 1-year Median MCLR data relate to September 15, 2017. Source: RBI. The massive in\ufb02ux of current account and savings account (CASA) deposits into the banking system post-demonetisation brought about an appreciable reduction in the cost of funds of banks and helped strengthen the transmission of monetary policy to lending rates. While transmission was relatively stronger to deposit rates before demonetisation, the transmission to marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) gained signi\ufb01cant traction post- demonetisation (Table IV.3). Across bank groups, the spread between weighted average lending rate (WALR) and MCLR remained higher in respect of outstanding rupee loans than in the case of fresh rupee loans, suggesting that transmission to rates on outstanding rupee loans was incomplete as they were contracted at a relatively higher cost and much of the legacy portfolios is linked to the base rate (which moved slower than the MCLR) (Chart IV.22). There also appears to have been divergence in base rate adjustments by banks to preserve margins on legacy portfolios given their weak balance sheets. Since December 2014, the median base rate of banks has declined by only about 75 bps as against the cumulative decline in the policy repo rate by 200 bps, suggesting that faster transmission to the entire loan book after the introduction of MCLR has not materialised. Overall, the transmission of policy rate cuts of 200 bps since January 2015 to fresh rupee loans has been to the tune of 193 bps under the MCLR regime. However, the transmission to outstanding rupee loans remained muted at only 125 bps, suggesting that there is further scope for banks to reduce rates on their legacy portfolios. The WALR on outstanding housing loans are closest to the one year median MCLR as well as the base rate, suggesting that banks charge lower spreads on such loans. This could be due to lower credit defaults in the sector and also due to competition from non-banks (Charts IV.23 and IV.24). The impact of competition is also evident from the greater transmission to large industry, which has access to alternative sources of funds, including the corporate bond market (Chart IV.25). Highly rated corporate bond yields, for example, have all along remained below the MCLR (Chart IV.26). Since July 31, 2017, several banks have reduced savings bank deposit rates, breaking the \u201ccartelised\u201d rigidity which had made saving deposit rates highly insensitive to monetary policy impulses even after banks were given full \ufb02exibility to set rates in October 2011. Flexible resetting of saving deposit rates, based on changing market clearing conditions and shifts in the stance of monetary policy, is important for greater \ufb02exibility in price setting behaviour on the asset side, given the high share of CASA deposits in total deposits Dr. Janak Raj) was constituted by the Reserve Bank to perspective of improving monetary transmission. The Study Group, which submitted its report on September 25, 2017, observed that internal benchmarks such as the base rate/MCLR have not delivered effective transmission of monetary policy. Arbitrariness in calculating the base rate/MCLR and spreads charged over them has undermined the integrity of the interest rate setting process. The base rate/MCLR regime is also not in sync with global practices on pricing of bank loans. The Study Group has, therefore, recommended a switchover to an external benchmark in a time-bound manner. (Please see the Report of the Study Group for further details). (Chart IV.27). Competition from small savings on which the interest rates have generally been higher than term deposit rates, and which are not adjusted as per the announced formula by the Government, has also constrained transmission (Table IV.4). The overall experience with the transmission of monetary policy since the switch over to the MCLR regime from the base rate in April 2016 has not been fully satisfactory. Therefore, as indicated in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies The amended RBI Act 1934 requires the Reserve Bank to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time, if any, in the public domain. The RBI\u2019s approach to managing persistent large surplus liquidity in the post-demonetisation period using a mix of conventional and unconventional instruments was presented in the Monetary Policy Average G-sec yield (%) of corresponding maturity (Jun to Aug 2017) Formula based rate of interest (%) (applicable for Oct to Dec 2017) GoI announced rate of interest (%) (applicable for Oct- Dec 2017) Difference (Percentage point) not transmitted $ Spreads for \ufb01xing small saving rates as per GoI Press Release of Feb 2016. Note: GoI decided to keep interest rates on small saving schemes for Q3:2017-18 unchanged. Report of April 2017. Anticipating that surplus liquidity conditions may persist through 2017-18, the RBI provided forward guidance on liquidity in April 2017: (a) variable reverse repo auctions with a preference for longer term tenors to be used as the key instrument for absorbing the remaining post- demonetisation liquidity surplus; (b) issuances of T-Bills and dated securities under the MSS up to `1 trillion; (c) issuances of CMBs of appropriate tenors of up to `1 trillion in accordance with the memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Government of India to manage enduring surpluses due to government operations; (d) open market operations with a view to moving system level liquidity to neutrality; and (e) \ufb01ne tuning reverse repo/repo operations to modulate day-to-day liquidity. In pursuance of this mandate, the Reserve Bank auctioned T-Bills (tenors ranging from 312 days to 329 days) aggregating `1 trillion under the MSS in April and May 2017. Incremental expansion in currency in circulation due to rapid remonetisation drained about `2 trillion of surplus liquidity during Q1 of 2017-18. However, this was more than offset by front-loaded expenditure by the Government and large redemption of Government securities. The average daily absorption of liquidity increased to `4,562 billion (including LAF, MSS and CMBs) during Q1 of 2017-18 from `3,141 billion at end-March 2017 (Chart IV.28). In Q2, frequent recourse to WMAs and ODs by the Government augmented market liquidity even as currency in circulation absorbed up to `569 billion. In addition to regular 7-day, 14-day and 28-day variable rate reverse repo auctions, the Reserve Bank conducted open market operations to absorb `600 billion on a durable basis (`200 billion each in July, August and September). With the Government\u2019s cash balance position improving during August, the net average daily absorption of liquidity declined from `5,126 billion (including LAF, MSS and CMBs) in the \ufb01rst week of August to `4,417 billion by end-August 2017. With advance tax out\ufb02ows in mid-September, the government cash balances increased to about `1,322 billion. Consequently, the surplus liquidity in the system declined to `2,771 billion by end-September. The combining of conventional and unconventional instruments into a pro-active liquidity management strategy could have been in\ufb02uential in averting potential risks to in\ufb02ation, both upside and downside (Box IV.2). A causal relationship running from excess liquidity in the banking system to in\ufb02 ation draws from the Friedmanesque proposition: \u201cin\ufb02 ation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\u201d. For modern central banks conducting monetary policy by setting interest rates consistent with the price stability objective, monetary expansion is endogenous \u2013 the operating procedure that fully accommodates demand for liquidity (or demand for bank reserves) to keep the overnight money market rates aligned to the policy rate internalises the central bank\u2019s balance sheet. In the face of inadequate credit demand, there has been an involuntary build-up of excess reserves in the banking system since November 2016 re\ufb02 ecting the return of speci\ufb01 ed bank notes (SBNs) as deposits with banks. Pro- active liquidity management ensured that the WACR did not fall signi\ufb01 cantly below the LAF \ufb02 oor under the pressure of the resulting liquidity glut. The variable that congeals all lead information about in\ufb02 ation is the monetary aggregate (or broad money), not central bank liquidity that only squares the daily system level mismatch. In fact, even though the net liquidity surplus [as percentage of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL)] in India has been persistently high since demonetisation, broad money (M3) and bank credit growth in the system have remained subdued (Chart IV.B.1). Thus, in\ufb02 ationary pressure could have emerged only if, illustratively, banks had leveraged on easing liquidity to expand credit at a rate faster than the growth in nominal GDP, leading to higher demand for money and stronger growth in broad money. A similar dynamic appears to be playing out under quantitative easing. Advanced economies, in fact, experienced de\ufb02 ation risks despite large surpluses of liquidity sloshing around (Reis, 2016). In the literature, empirical evidence shows that excess liquidity has stoked equity price in\ufb02 ation (Balatti et al, 2017). It has also been found, however, that the dynamic effects of excess liquidity shocks on in\ufb02 ation and asset prices may depend on the state of the economy, in particular, on the state of the business cycle, the credit cycle, the starting position in the in\ufb02 ation and asset price cycles and the monetary policy stance (Baumeister et al, 2008). Drawing on this empirical literature, two vector auto-regression (VAR) models were used with four variables each, taking into account the frequency of data availability. While daily data covering the period from July 2010 to July 2017 are used in the \ufb01 rst model (daily net LAF as proportion to banks\u2019 NDTL; daily changes in the spread of the WACR over the effective Fed funds rate, daily changes in the BSE Sensex; and daily net FPI in\ufb02 ows into equity), monthly data covering the period from January 2011 to July 2017 are used in the second model (monthly change in net LAF as proportion to NDTL; spread of the WACR over the repo rate; annualised m-o-m changes in the headline CPI index; and annualised m-o-m changes in broad money as the four variables). All variables used in the two models are stationary, and the VAR lag length is determined by the standard Akaike information criterion/Schwarz information criterion. Impulse response functions suggest that excess liquidity does not have a statistically signi\ufb01 cant impact on the paths of either equity price changes or CPI in\ufb02 ation (Chart IV.B.2). However, a standard deviation shock to broad money (i.e., an increase) is found to be in\ufb02 ationary, as expected. This re\ufb02 ects that when excess liquidity does not lead to higher money growth, it is not in\ufb02 ationary. An exogenous shock to liquidity in the model does not cause either broad money growth With remonetisation, currency in circulation has steadily moved closer to the pre-demonetisation level (Chart IV.29), reaching about 88 per cent of the level (`17.97 trillion) prevailing around the immediate pre- demonetisation period. Looking forward, surplus liquidity conditions are likely to persist in the second half of 2017-18, which will test the goals and instrumentation of the Reserve Bank\u2019s liquidity management framework in its resolve to align the operating target of monetary policy \u2013 the WACR \u2013 with the policy repo rate and to enable the seamless evolution of other rates in the money market spectrum. Equity and bond markets will likely have to contend with volatility from investor sentiment shifts in response to both global and domestic factors. In the forex market too, the outlook for capital \ufb02ows and the likely path of the US dollar would interact with domestic fundamentals and the current account de\ufb01cit to impinge on fair values of the exchange rate and deviations therefrom. A robust revival in credit growth hinges on resolution of stressed assets in the banking system, early and adequate recapitalisation of to increase or interest rates to fall. It is, therefore, not surprising that post-demonetisation surplus liquidity has not had any impact on in\ufb02 ation in India so far. Mirco Balatti, Chris Brooks, Michael P.

Ongoing efforts to determine a suitable external benchmark for bank lending rates should bring greater transparency in due course in the setting of interest rates by banks and help improve monetary policy transmission. Global growth has broadened to encompass several advanced and emerging market economies. World trade has also picked up and is likely to outpace global GDP growth. Inflationary pressures remain subdued across geographies, supported by soft commodity prices. Since the MPR of April 2017, global growth has strengthened, spreading to several AEs and some commodity exporting EMEs as well, lifting the latter out of recession. Global trade has been buoyed by gradually \ufb01 rming demand, and exports and imports have risen in several economies. Crude prices have \ufb01 rmed up in Q3 on the easing supply glut. Metal prices have rallied, fuelled by resurgent Chinese demand, but have moderated in recent weeks. Growing risk appetite for \ufb01 nancial assets led to a fall in bullion prices to multi-month lows, before a recent rally in September. In\ufb02 ation remains below target levels in many AEs and subdued across several EMEs. International \ufb01 nancial markets have been buoyed by these global growth prospects and the accommodative monetary policy stance in major AEs. Financial markets have remained resilient to geo-political events and more recently to the US Fed\u2019s decision to reduce the size of its balance sheet. Equity markets rallied in most AEs, while some correction has been witnessed in a few EMEs. Bond yields in major AEs hardened on expectations of monetary policy normalisation, but generally declined in EMEs with softening in\ufb02 ation and neutral or accommodative policy rates. The US dollar weakened to a multi-month low in September, while the euro rallied further. Movements in EME currencies were mixed but with a general tendency to appreciate. In the Euro area, economic recovery has gained traction and broadened across constituent economies. GDP growth in Q2 improved over and above the relatively strong outturn in Q1. Unemployment fell consistently, and retail sales rose, lifting both business and consumer sentiment. Strengthening external demand and receding political uncertainty in the region supported the recovery. In Japan, economic expansion accelerated in Q2 from its modest pace in the previous \ufb01 ve quarters. Domestic demand \u2013 both consumption and investment \u2013 rose to a three-year peak. In spite of a weak currency and stronger global demand, net exports turned negative as imports rose, indicating resilient domestic activity. Industrial production accelerated and the labour market steadily tightened, even as \ufb01 nancial conditions remained highly accommodative (Table V.1). The US economy expanded at a solid pace in Q2 after a weak performance in Q1. Buoyant labour market conditions, upbeat consumer con\ufb01 dence, softer than expected in\ufb02 ation and a robust housing market supported consumer spending. Industrial production showed an upswing, while non-residential investment growth made a turnaround. Retail sales and business spending suggest that the growth momentum has been sustained in early Q3. However, recent hurricanes could temporarily weigh on economic activity. E : Estimate, P : Projection, *: GDP y-o-y.

In China, growth regained some lost momentum in Q2, supported by \ufb01 scal stimulus and growing global demand. However, investment slowed down as lending costs rose and the property market cooled off, though manufacturing continued to expand in spite of tighter \ufb01 nancial conditions. China\u2019s debt-fuelled growth remains a potential source of \ufb01 nancial instability, triggering a rating downgrade by S&P Global Ratings for the \ufb01 rst time since 1999. The Brazilian economy expanded for two consecutive quarters in Q2, but growth dynamics remained fragile due to the depressed labour market and political uncertainty. The Russian economy emerged out of two years of recession, supported by the strengthening global environment and improving macroeconomic fundamentals. Middle-income Asian economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand improved their growth performance during H1:2017, riding on stronger demand at home and from abroad. Growth in South Korea, which has risen markedly in Q1, decelerated in Q2 due to a sharp fall in Chinese tourism following a heightening of geopolitical tensions. South Africa exited recession in Q2, however, it continues to face economic and political challenges.

According to the WTO, this would crucially depend on the performance recovery in merchandise trade could also provide some rising in 2017 and 2018. However, major economies could face a tough policy environment with the imposition of Section 301 of US trade law that allows Global commodity prices were affected by demand and supply imbalances, geopolitical tensions and including weather factors, commodity-speci\ufb01 c conditions in respect of agricultural commodities. Commodity prices measured by the Bloomberg commodity index declined by 1.0 per cent during April to September 2017, despite some pick-up in late June-July on the upsurge in Chinese demand. Crude oil prices declined by over 8.0 percent in Q2:2017 on account of high inventories, though supply cuts agreed by the OPEC led to some \ufb01 rming up in May. In late Q3, Brent crude prices hit a two-year high in September due to OPEC cuts, declining US crude oil inventories, adverse climatic conditions and geo- political concerns (Chart V.3). Although the recent hurricanes in the US have not impacted crude and gasoline production, the slowdown in localised re\ufb01 nery activity did cause supply disruptions for a short duration. Base metal prices rose by 10.1 per cent during April to September 2017, led by copper, zinc, nickel, aluminium and tin, while prices of iron declined. Metal prices, particularly of copper, have rallied since mid-July, driven by increased demand from China where production itself was disrupted as a fallout of environmental inspections, however, some moderation was witnessed in recent weeks. Gold and silver prices fell by about 1 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, during Q2:2017 on increased risk appetite that reduced safe haven demand and also due to the weaker US dollar. During Q3:2017, precious metal prices, particularly of gold, have shown some recovery, hitting a 12-month high as tensions sparked between the US and North Korea. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)\u2019s food price index grew by over 2 per cent during Q2:2017, driven predominantly by dairy and meat prices. In contrast, edible oil and sugar price indices declined beginning January 2017. Cereal and sugar prices have started \ufb01 rming up from July (Chart V.4). Soft commodity prices have kept in\ufb02 ation expectations quiescent in most AEs, even as economic activity and job creation have strengthened. In\ufb02 ation in the US has remained well below the target in 2017. Euro area in\ufb02 ation has remained below the target due to still persisting slack in the labour market, despite the sharp increase in energy prices in August. In Japan, in\ufb02 ation continued to be low at less than 0.5 per cent, though de\ufb02 ationary fears have disappeared (Chart V.5a). In\ufb02 ationary pressures in EMEs continued to be divergent (Chart V.5b). In China, in\ufb02 ation inched up in Q2 following a signi\ufb01 cant fall in Q1 and touched a seven-month high in September on account of strong domestic demand and increase in the prices of non- food items. In Russia, in\ufb02 ation fell for the \ufb01 rst time below the target of 4 per cent in July, while in Brazil, it touched the lower band of the target of 3 per cent in June. In South Africa, in\ufb02 ation eased during 2017, primarily due to falling food in\ufb02 ation. By contrast, Turkey has continued to face double digit in\ufb02 ation since February 2017, driven by high food, transport and housing prices. In\ufb02 ation in Indonesia surpassed the target of 4 per cent in Q2 on upward revisions in administered electricity prices and festival-related hikes in food prices; however price pressures have moderated recently. The monetary policy remained accommodative globally, though systemic central banks are increasingly communicating an intent towards policy normalisation. In AEs, the US Fed and Bank of Canada raised policy rates. The US has announced balance sheet normalisation beginning October 2017. Sustained economic expansion and job gains have prompted the US Fed to raise policy rates four times in eighteen months, the last being in June. In its September policy meeting, the ECB kept its policy stance unchanged as in\ufb02 ation remains subdued and reaf\ufb01 rmed continuance of its ultra-easy policy stance. Similarly, the Bank of England kept its policy rate unchanged in August, but sounded hawkish as in\ufb02 ation remained above the target due to a weak currency. The Bank of Japan, however, has continued with its ultra-accommodative stance as in\ufb02 ation has remained low with growth still modest (Chart V.6a). stance has Even though monetary policy stances remained diverse in EMEs, several of them either reduced policy rates or kept them unchanged. In Brazil, the policy rate was cut for the sixth time in a row in 2017 so far, as the in\ufb02 ationary situation improved and remained resilient to political uncertainty, while the currency strengthened. South Africa cut its policy rate for the \ufb01 rst time in \ufb01 ve years in July as the economy slipped into recession in Q1 while in\ufb02 ation pressures eased. Russia cut its policy rate four times in 2017 so far, to support economic recovery, as in\ufb02 ation continued to decline. Although China has kept key policy rates unchanged since October 2015 to control excessive debt \ufb01 nancing, liquidity in the system has been tightened through measures such as open market operations. Chile has kept the policy rate unchanged since the rate cut effected in May to support economic activity. Indonesia cut its policy rate twice in Q3 of 2017 on falling in\ufb02 ation and lower current account de\ufb01 cit. Turkey left its tight monetary policy stance unchanged as in\ufb02 ation remained elevated. in By contrast, Mexico raised the policy rate tandem with the US, given close economic linkages (Chart V.6b). Changing expectations about the course of monetary policy in AEs and improving economic prospects in\ufb02 uenced risk perceptions of investors and drove global \ufb01 nancial markets. Although markets have remained relatively calm and stable, the unwinding of the expansion in Fed\u2019s balance sheet since the global \ufb01 nancial crisis is a potential vortex of tension going forward. With its massive holdings of government and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the Fed is the most dominant player in the US bond market. Furthermore, a reduction of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet would echo growing con\ufb01 dence in the US economy. In turn, this has some implications for \ufb01 nancial markets in EMEs (Box V.1). Three rounds of quantitative easing (QE) in the aftermath of the global \ufb01 nancial crisis swelled the Fed\u2019s balance sheet from US$ 0.7 trillion in 2008 to the current level of US$ 4.2 trillion, consisting of government securities of around US$ 2.0 trillion, mortgage backed securities (MBS) of US$ 1.7 trillion and other assets. This has had large spillover effects on EMEs through capital \ufb02 ows, though they remained smaller in countries with better fundamentals (Chen et al., 2014). With the strengthening of economic growth in the US, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) indicated a state-contingent unwinding of the balance sheet in June 2017 and outlined the broad principle: government securities and MBS would be allowed to roll off without reinvesting in a graduated manner, which would translate to an annual average reduction of about US$ 270 billion in government securities and US$ 180 billion in MBS over the next two years. In its meeting held on September 20, 2017, the FOMC announced that it would initiate the balance sheet normalisation programme from October 2017. A reversal of QE may involve standard channels of transmission. First, long-term bond yields could increase due to a rise in the term premium induced by higher supply for bonds, leading to steepening of the yield curve. The rise in bond yields, along with tightening of \ufb01 nancial conditions, would lead to portfolio rebalancing from equity and risky assets to bonds. Second, a combination of portfolio substitution, risk aversion and safe haven demand could cause a rise in bond yields in the US which could, in turn, induce large capital out\ufb02 ows from EMEs \u2013 the larger the external de\ufb01 cit and debt of a country, the higher could be capital out\ufb02 ows and the resultant currency depreciation vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar. Third, consequent upon reallocation of funds by investors towards AEs, \ufb01 nancial conditions in EMEs could tighten. Lower asset prices and increased cost of borrowing could adversely affect balance sheets of corporates and banks in these countries, potentially causing rollover problems on debt issued in international markets. Fourth, the exchange rate regime would play an important role in the spillover to the real economy and domestic \ufb01 nancial markets. In the case of India, assuming a symmetric reversal of capital in\ufb02 ows during QE, Patra et al., (2016) found that capital out\ufb02 ows could primarily take place through the portfolio rebalancing channel (about 35 per cent of in\ufb02 ow during QE), followed by the liquidity channel1. A hypothetical exercise assuming Fed balance sheet reduction by about one-third to one-half and impacts that are symmetric to that of QE estimated in Bhattarai et al., (2015) in a Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) framework indicates the following: (i) in the US, bond yields could harden in the range of 40-60 bps, while the exchange rate could appreciate by about 1-3 per cent and equity prices could fall by about 4-6 per cent; and (ii) spillovers to \ufb01 nancial markets in EMEs (including India) could result in bond yields \ufb01 rming up by 12-18 bps, the effective exchange rate depreciating by 0.3-1.0 per cent and equity prices falling by 2.7-5.3 per cent. An event study based on 20 minutes interval data for a two-day window on September 20, 2017 was conducted to gauge the market reaction to the FOMC announcement of Fed balance sheet normalisation in \ufb01 ve select economies, viz., Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey. Financial market volatility, as measured by the coef\ufb01 cient of variation2 (CV), in various market segments, viz., bond, currency and equity markets in the US and other \ufb01 ve economies, increased generally. The immediate effect of the announcement was more pronounced on the bond market in the US, especially for the short tenor securities, while the impact on bond markets in other countries was muted (Chart V.B.1). In currency markets, the impact fell largely on the Turkish lira and the South African rand. The Indian rupee was also impacted to some extent. The impact on other currencies was muted. No signi\ufb01 cant impact was felt on equity markets. The volatility triggered by the FOMC statement in EMEs was mixed (Chart V.B.2). While volatility in bond markets remained higher on the post-announcement day in Brazil, South Africa and Turkey, it declined in Indonesia. In currency markets, volatility increased in 1 The liquidity channel of QE transmission refers to the higher availability of reserves that brings about a decline in liquidity premium, a reduction in borrowing costs and an increase in lending by hitherto credit-constrained lenders. 2 The coef\ufb01 cient of variation (CV) is a standardised measure of dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution and can be calculated as a ratio of standard deviation to the mean. all other countries, barring Turkey, and especially for India. In equity markets, volatility remained higher than the pre-announcement day for all other countries, barring Brazil.

Meanwhile, sovereign bond yields in many AEs rose in recent months, although they remain low by historical standards, given the still low policy rates and term premia suppressed by large assets holdings of central banks. Furthermore, in the US, yields are still trading lower than at the beginning of 2017, as in\ufb02 ation has undershot expectations. In the Euro area, the benchmark 10-year German bond yield rose to a peak level in June as markets began to anticipate the possibility of reversal in monetary easing by the ECB. In the UK, a higher future policy path combined with an in\ufb02 ation rate above target led to a rise in bond yields. In Japan, however, bond yields remained close to zero under the active yield control policy of the Bank of Japan (Chart V.7a). In emerging markets, falling in\ufb02 ation and generally unchanged policy rates led to a fall in yields of local currency denominated bonds. in economic prospects also led to a softening in bond yields in EMEs as risk premia declined and induced capital in\ufb02 ows into bond markets. Equity prices have risen signi\ufb01 cantly across economies due to a combination of better global economic prospects, higher corporate earnings and increased risk appetite of investors. The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World Index, which measures global equity prices, increased by 8.5 per cent between April and September 2017. Across the world, information technology (IT) share prices have gained the most. Bank share prices have also gained on the back of the rise in long-term government bond yields, which has raised the prospects of banks\u2019 interest earnings. In the US, the Fed\u2019s favourable stress test results further boosted share prices of banks. Similarly, in the Euro area, bank share prices were helped by national reform programmes undertaken by the European Commission. In Japan, a rally in share prices during 2017 was driven by stronger economic performance and higher corporate earnings, partly due to a weaker currency and a lower corporate tax. Equity prices in EMEs gained even more on the positive outlook on economic growth. The gain has been particularly notable for emerging Asia, largely driven by equity prices of IT \ufb01 rms (Chart V.7b). Currency markets were driven by expectations that monetary policy in some AEs would become less accommodative. However, the US dollar continued to depreciate against several currencies since Q1:2017, despite the raising of the policy rate by the Fed in June (Chart V.8a). On the other hand, the euro appreciated signi\ufb01 cantly against the US dollar and the Japanese yen, driven by a change in the forward guidance of the ECB on reviving economic conditions and marked reduction in political uncertainty. The Japanese yen has continued to \ufb02 uctuate against the US dollar, but with a depreciating bias, driven by movements in 10-year government bond yield differentials between these two countries. In EMEs, currency movements against the US dollar have been mixed, with country-speci\ufb01 c factors playing a signi\ufb01 cant role (Chart V.8b). The Russian ruble, which strengthened in Q1, depreciated in Q2 due to falling crude oil prices. The Brazilian real depreciated sharply in Q2 and shed all the gains during Q1, following domestic political developments, but recouped in Q3. Most other EME currencies appreciated against the US dollar on surges of capital in\ufb02 ows driven by varied (China, Thailand and emerging European economies); remained weak); and easing of border tensions (Mexico). In sum, a cyclical global economic recovery has gained some momentum which could likely be sustained in 2017. While economic growth has \ufb01 rmed up in some major AEs, it is also showing a turnaround in EMEs. Although in\ufb02 ation pressures remain contained, the recent uptick in commodity prices pose an upside risk. The monetary policy stance will likely shift towards normalisation in major AEs and will be a critical factor in shaping the behaviour of global \ufb01 nancial markets with concomitant implications for EMEs.
